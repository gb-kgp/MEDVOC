# Codebase for MEDVOC
 The official codebase for our IJCAI 2024 submission titled "MEDdVOC: Vocabulary Adaptation for Fine-tuning Pre-trained Language Models on Medical Text Summarization". We also provide the technical appendix for the submission. Preprint for the submission can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04163)

 1.  ```src``` folder contains codebase for vocabulary adaption algorithm along with the modified codes to handle the models with updated vocabulary.

 2. ```data``` folder contains details on how you can acquire data that we used in this work.

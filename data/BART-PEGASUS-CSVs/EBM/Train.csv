"Can patients with steatohepatitis take statins
To evaluate the efficacy and safety of three hypolipidemic agents in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease associated with hyperlipidemia. Patients with dyslipidemia (Fredrickson type IIb), asymptomatic persistent transaminasemia lasting 24 weeks, and evidence of hepatic fat infiltration on ultrasonography and liver biopsy were studied. Those with predominant hypertriglyceridemia received omega-3 fatty acids (5 mL thrice daily) (Group A), those with predominant hypercholesterolemia received atorvastatin 20 mg/daily (Group B), and overweight patients received orlistat 120 mg thrice daily before meals (Group C). After 24 weeks of treatment, serum transaminase and lipid levels and liver ultrasonography were repeated. Serum transaminase levels decreased significantly (p< 0.001) in all groups but the decrease was more marked in Group C (AST 75 [16] to 31 [7] IU/L; ALT 120 [38] to 41 [10] IU/L) than in Group A (AST 70 [14] to 41 [6]; ALT 110 [20] to 68 [12]) or Group B (AST 68 [13] to 46 [9]; ALT 115 [22] to 76.6 [13]). After treatment, ultrasonography showed resolution of fatty liver in 35% of patients in Group A, 61% in Group B, and in 86% in Group C (p< 0.001, Group C vs. A). A decline in transaminase levels and normalization of ultrasonographic evidence of fatty liver were observed on treatment with omega-3 fatty acids in patients with hypertriglyceridemia, with atorvastatin in those with hypercholesterolemia, and orlistat in overweight patients with hyperlipidemia.","Another study included patients with biopsy-confirmed fatty liver and elevated alanine transaminase levels greater than 1.5 times the upper limit of normal. In this 24-week study, 23 predominantly hypertriglyceridemic patients took omega-3 fatty acids, 5 mL 3 times daily, 28 hypercholesterolemic patients took atorvastatin 20 mg daily, and 21 dyslipidemic patients with a body mass index >27.0 took orlistat 120 mg 3 times daily. alanine transaminase levels decreased in all 3 groups during the study. Ultrasonography showed normal liver echo pattern at the end of treatment for 35% of omega-3 patients, 61% of atorvastatin patients, and 86% of orlistat patients. No serious adverse events were observed."
"Is the ThinPrep better than conventional Pap smear at detecting cervical cancer
More than 2 million U.S. women receive an equivocal cervical cytologic diagnosis (atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance [ASCUS]) each year. Effective colposcopy triage strategies are needed to identify the minority of women who have clinically significant disease while avoiding excessive follow-up evaluation for others. The ASCUS/LSIL (i.e., low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion) Triage Study (ALTS) is a multicenter, randomized trial comparing the sensitivity and specificity of the following three management strategies to detect cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 (CIN3): 1) immediate colposcopy (considered to be the reference standard), 2) triage to colposcopy based on human papillomavirus (HPV) results from Hybrid Capture 2(TM) (HC 2) and thin-layer cytology results, or 3) triage based on cytology results alone. This article summarizes the cross-sectional enrollment results for 3488 women with a referral diagnosis of ASCUS. All statistical tests are two-sided. Among participants with ASCUS, the underlying prevalence of histologically confirmed CIN3 was 5.1%. Sensitivity to detect CIN3 or above by testing for cancer-associated HPV DNA was 96.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 91.6% to 98.8%), with 56.1% of women referred to colposcopy. Sensitivity of a single repeat cytology specimen with a triage threshold of HSIL or above was 44.1% (95% CI = 35.6% to 52.9%), with 6.9% referred. Sensitivity of a lower cytology triage threshold of ASCUS or above was 85.3% (95% CI = 78.2% to 90.8%), with 58.6% referred. HC 2 testing for cancer-associated HPV DNA is a viable option in the management of women with ASCUS. It has greater sensitivity to detect CIN3 or above and specificity comparable to a single additional cytologic test indicating ASCUS or above.",The large ALTS trial supports the use of liquid-based cytology because it has shown HPV testing in patients with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance decreases the need for colposcopy.
"What is the best approach to a solitary pulmonary nodule identified by chest x-ray
To determine the test performance characteristics of various modalities for the diagnosis of suspected lung cancer. A systematic search of MEDLINE, HealthStar, and Cochrane Library databases to July 2001 and print bibliographies was performed to identify studies comparing the results of sputum cytology, bronchoscopy, transthoracic needle aspirate (TTNA), or biopsy with histologic reference standard diagnoses among at least 50 patients with suspected lung cancer. For sputum cytology, the pooled specificity was 0.99 and the pooled sensitivity was 0.66, but sensitivity was higher for central lesions than for peripheral lesions (0.71 vs 0.49, respectively). Studies on bronchoscopic procedures provided data only on diagnostic yield (sensitivity). The diagnosis of endobronchial disease by bronchoscopy in 30 studies showed the highest sensitivity for endobronchial biopsy (0.74), followed by cytobrushing (0.59) and washing (0.48). The sensitivity for all modalities combined was 0.88. Thirty studies reported on peripheral lesions. Cytobrushing demonstrated the highest sensitivity (0.52), followed by transbronchial biopsy (0.46) and BAL/washing (0.43). The overall sensitivity for all modalities was 0.69. Peripheral lesions < 2 cm or > 2 cm in diameter showed sensitivities of 0.33 and 0.62, respectively. Updating a previous meta-analysis with 19 studies revealed a pooled sensitivity of 0.90 for TTNA. A trend toward lower sensitivity was noted for lesions that were < 2 cm in diameter. The accuracy in differentiating between small cell and non-small cell cytology for the various diagnostic modalities was 0.98, with individual studies ranging from 0.94 to 1.0. The average false-positive and false-negative rates were 0.09 and 0.02, respectively. The sensitivity of bronchoscopy is high for endobronchial disease and poor for peripheral lesions that are < 2 cm in diameter. The sensitivity of TTNA is excellent for malignant disease. The distinction between small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer by cytology appears to be accurate.","A recent systematic review of studies evaluating patients with suspected lung cancer looked into the diagnostic sensitivity of various methods of histologic and cytologic tests. Researchers compared the evaluated test results to a reference standard of pathology/histology, definitive cytology, or at least 1-year radiographic follow-up. Transbronchial needle aspiration showed a sensitivity of 67% (95% CI, 64%-70%) for peripheral lung malignancy of any size; however, only 5 studies met study criteria and their sample sizes varied greatly (n=20 to n=480). Eight studies looking at bronchoscopy (including brush or biopsy) for peripheral lung lesions <2 cm in diameter yielded a sensitivity of only 33% (95% CI, 28%-38%). In the same systematic review, 61 studies of transthoracic needle aspiration for localized pulmonary lesions of any size had a pooled sensitivity of 90% (95% CI, 88%-92%). The prevalence of malignancy in the studies ranged from 0.58 to 0.93.15 Factors affecting heterogeneity between studies included the wide range in study dates, imaging technology used, and study sizes."
"What evaluation is best for an isolated, enlarged cervical lymph node
Lymphadenopathy is common, affecting patients of all ages. The current referral pattern for investigating patients with lymphadenopathy varies widely with no universally practised pathway. Our institution set up a lymph node diagnostic clinic (LNDC) accepting direct referrals from primary care physicians. Details of clinical presentation and investigations were recorded prospectively. Between December 1996 and July 2001, 550 patients were referred (M: 203; F:347). The median age was 40 years (range 14-90). The median time between initial referral and the first clinic visit was 6 days. Of 95 patients diagnosed to have malignant diseases, the median time from the first clinic visit to reaching malignant diagnosis was 15 days. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified five significant predictors for malignant nodes: male gender (risk ratio (RR)=2.72; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.63-4.56), increasing age (RR=1.05; 95% CI: 1.04-1.07), white ethnicity (RR=3.01; 95% CI: 1.19-7.6) and sites of lymph nodes: supraclavicular region (RR=3.72; 95% CI: 1.52-9.12) and > or = 2 regions of lymph nodes (RR=6.41; 95% CI: 2.82-14.58). Ultrasound and fine-needle aspiration cytology of palpable lymph nodes were performed in 154 and 289 patients, respectively. An accuracy of 97 and 84% was found, respectively. In conclusion, a multidisciplinary lymph node diagnostic clinic enables a rapid, concerted approach to a common medical problem and patients with malignant diseases were diagnosed in a timely fashion.","A study of 550 patients identified 5 significant predictors of malignancy: male gender (risk ratio [RR]=2.72; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.63-4.56), increasing age (RR=1.05; 95% CI, 1.04-1.07), white ethnicity (RR=3.01; 95% CI, 1.19-7.6), supraclavicular lymph nodes (RR=3.72; 95% CI, 1.52-9.12), and 2 or more regions of lymph nodes (RR=6.41; 95% CI, 2.82-14.58)."
"What is the best test to diagnose urinary tract stones
Hematuria testing is routinely performed in patients with acute flank pain to screen for ureterolithiasis and to help determine the need for excretory urography. Unenhanced helical computerized tomography (CT) has recently been shown to be superior to excretory urography in diagnosing ureteral obstruction and can evaluate many other causes of flank pain. Given the speed, accuracy and safety of CT the value of hematuria testing for acute flank pain should be reexamined. We reviewed the medical records of 267 consecutive patients with acute flank pain referred for unenhanced helical CT. Microscopic and dipstick urinalysis data were obtained in 195 patients. Using helical CT as the gold standard, we calculated the sensitivity, specificity, predictive value and accuracy of hematuria for diagnosing ureterolithiasis. Of the patients with ureterolithiasis 33% had 5 or less, 19% had 1 or less and 11% had no red blood cells (RBCs) per high power field. Of the patients without ureterolithiasis 24% had greater than 5 and 51% had greater than 1 RBC per high power field. Of the patients with ureterolithiasis 14% had a negative dipstick test and 1 RBC or less per high power field. There were 25 patients without ureterolithiasis who had CT abnormalities unrelated to the urinary tract, of whom 8 had greater than 1 RBC per high power field. Absence of hematuria in the setting of acute flank pain cannot exclude a diagnosis of ureterolithiasis and should not obviate other diagnostic testing. Even when strongly positive on microscopy, hematuria has insufficient positive predictive value for diagnosing ureterolithiasis and may be misleading as other serious conditions resulting in acute flank pain may yield a positive test.",A study found that urine dipstick testing for hematuria yielded positive likelihood ratios of 1.25 and a negative likelihood ratio of 0.55.
"What is the best management for patients with evidence of asymptomatic ischemia on exercise stress testing
The appropriate management of patients with intermediate-risk Duke treadmill scores is not established. The purpose of this study was to determine the long-term risk of subsequent cardiovascular events in patients with an intermediate-risk treadmill score who do not have myocardial perfusion defects on radionuclide imaging. The existing databases of the nuclear cardiology laboratories of 4 academic institutions were searched retrospectively. A total of 4649 patients were identified who had intermediate-risk Duke treadmill scores (-10 to 4), normal or near-normal exercise single photon-emission computed tomographic myocardial perfusion images using either thallium-201 or technetium-99m sestamibi, and no previous coronary revascularization. Follow-up was 95% complete. Cardiovascular survival was 99.8% at 1 year, 99.0% at 5 years, and 98.5% at 7 years. Cardiac survival free of myocardial infarction was similarly high at 96.6% at 7 years. Cardiac survival free of myocardial infarction or revascularization was 87.1% at 7 years. Near-normal scans and cardiac enlargement were independent predictors of time to cardiac death. Seven-year cardiac survival was still high at 97.0% in the 357 patients with near-normal scans and normal cardiac size and somewhat lower, at 89.0%, in the 167 patients with cardiac enlargement. Patients with an intermediate-risk treadmill score but with normal or near-normal exercise myocardial perfusion images and normal cardiac sizes are at low risk for subsequent cardiac death and can be safely managed medically until their symptoms warrant revascularization. The appropriate management of patients with cardiac enlargement will remain a matter of clinical judgment.","Patients with an intermediate-risk DTS, and normal or near-normal perfusion imaging without cardiomegaly, also comprised a low-risk group with 5-year cardiac survival of 99.5%."
"What is the best diagnostic approach to alopecia in women
To describe an organized diagnostic approach for both nonscarring and scarring alopecias to help family physicians establish an accurate in-office diagnosis. To explain when ancillary laboratory workup is necessary to confirm the diagnosis. Current diagnostic and therapeutic interventions for hair loss are based on randomized controlled studies, uncontrolled studies, and case series. MEDLINE was searched from January 1966 to December 1998 with the MeSH words alopecia, hair, and alopecia areata. Articles were selected on the basis of experimental design, with priority given to the most current large multicentre controlled studies. Overall global evidence for therapeutic intervention for hair loss is quite strong. The most common forms of nonscarring alopecias are androgenic alopecia, telogen effluvium, and alopecia areata. Other disorders include trichotillomania, traction alopecia, tinea capitis, and hair shaft abnormalities. Scarring alopecia is caused by trauma, infections, discoid lupus erythematosus, or lichen planus. Key to establishing an accurate diagnosis is a detailed history, including medication use, systemic illnesses, endocrine dysfunction, hair-care practices, and family history. All hair-bearing sites should be examined. A 4-mm punch biopsy of the scalp is useful, particularly to diagnose scarring alopecias. Once a diagnosis has been established, specific therapy can be initiated. Diagnosis and management of hair loss is an interesting challenge for family physicians. An organized approach to recognizing characteristic differential features of hair loss disorders is key to diagnosis and management.","If a patient has scarring alopecia, a scalp biopsy is almost always necessary to make a diagnosis."
"Which oral antifungal is best for toenail onychomycosis
This analysis was conducted at HIP Health plan of New Jersey (a Northeastern group model health maintenance organization) to determine the most cost-effective therapy among the three currently available oral antifungal drugs that are indicated for the treatment of onychomycosis: griseofulvin, itraconazole, and terbinafine. Costs of an appropriate and complete treatment regimen were calculated for each of the three drugs based on average wholesale price. Efficacy was determined by meta-analysis of the published literature for those studies where appropriate treatment regimens for onychomycosis were put to use. Efficacy outcome measures were limited to mycologic cure rates in the more recalcitrant cases of toenail onychomycosis. From these measures of cost and efficacy, a cost/efficacy ratio was calculated for each drug by dividing the cost per treatment by the weighted average mycological cure rate. This ratio represents the cost per mycologically cured infection. The final outcome measure (the cost per mycologically cured infection) was $2,721.28, $1,845.05, and $648.96, for griseofulvin, itraconazole, and terbinafine continuous therapies, respectively. For itraconazole and terbinafine pulse therapy, the costs were $855.88 and $388.50, respectively. For both continuous and pulse therapy, terbinafine is apparently the most cost-effective drug, followed by itraconazole and then by griseofulvin. Terbinafine has the fewest drug interactions and the highest treatment success rate.","A cost-efficacy analysis of terbinafine, itraconazole, and griseofulvin found terbinafine to be the most cost-effective."
"What is the role of combination therapy insulin plus oral medication in type 2 diabetes
Few large randomized controlled trials have assessed the value of adding insulin to an oral antidiabetic drug regimen. This trial compared the efficacy and safety of biphasic insulin aspart 30/70 (BIAsp 30) plus pioglitazone (n = 93), glibenclamide (glyburide) plus pioglitazone (n = 91), or BIAsp 30 monotherapy (n = 97). This 18-week, multinational, multicenter, randomized, open-label, parallel-group trial involved 281 patients with type 2 diabetes (60% male; mean age, 56 years; mean body mass index, 29.5 kg/m2) with inadequate glycemic control (mean glycosylated hemoglobin [HbA(1c)], 9.5%; range, 7.4%-14.7%) on glibenclamide monotherapy or combination therapy. The primary objective was to compare end-of-trial HbA(1c) among the 3 treatment groups. Fasting and mean 7- and 8-point blood glucose profiles, blood lipid levels, plasminogen activator inhibitor levels, adverse events, and hypoglycemia frequency were also compared. Patients using BIAsp 30 (alone or with pioglitazone) were injected twice daily (immediately before breakfast and dinner). Pioglitazone (30 mg/d) and glibenclamide (5-15 mg/d) were taken orally once daily with or immediately after breakfast. At the end of the trial, HbA(1c) was significantly lower for the BIAsp 30 plus pioglitazone group than for the glibenclamide plus pioglitazone group (mean [SD], -0.64% [0.23%]; P = 0.005) and the BIAsp 30 monotherapy group (-0.60% [0.22%]; P = 0.008). Mean (SD) fasting blood glucose (before breakfast) was significantly lower for BIAsp 30 plus pioglitazone than for glibenclamide plus pioglitazone (153 [45] mg/dL vs 169 [65] mg/dL, respectively; P = 0.012). Each time point on the 8-point blood glucose profile was lower for BIAsp 30 plus pioglitazone than for glibenclamide plus pioglitazone (P < 0.001 to P < 0.05). No major hypoglycemic episodes were reported, and the absolute rate of hypoglycemic events was low (<1 event/patient-week) in the BIAsp-only group. Edema was reported in < or =9% of patients in each treatment group, but no occurrence was classified as serious. Weight gain (mean, 4.0 kg) was more common in the BIAsp plus pioglitazone group (8%); however, this was consistent with improved glycemic control and is similar to that reported in other pioglitazone trials. BIAsp 30 plus pioglitazone provided an efficacious and well-tolerated treatment alternative to glibenclamide plus pioglitazone or BIAsp 30 alone in this population of patients who previously were not well controlled on glibenclamide monotherapy or combination therapy.","An open-label randomized controlled trials evaluated 281 patients with at least 3 months of inadequate glycemic control (HbA1c=7.4%-14.7%) on a sulfonylurea. Patients were randomized to a) switching to a combination of biphasic insulin aspart 30/70 plus pioglitazone, b) adding pioglitazone to the sulfonylurea, or c) switching to insulin alone (biphasic insulin aspart 30/70). After 18 weeks, insulin plus pioglitazone reduced HbA1c significantly more than either glyburide plus pioglitazone (P=.005) or insulin alone (P=.005). However, the insulin plus pioglitazone group had the most weight gain (mean 4 kg, similar to other pioglitazone trials). There were no major hypoglycemic events."
"How should patients with mitral regurgitation be followed
To evaluate the relationship between the intensity of murmurs and severity of mitral and aortic regurgitation. Consecutive patients with chronic isolated aortic (n = 40) or mitral (n = 170) regurgitation undergoing echocardiographic quantitation of regurgitation between 1990 and 1991 were studied. Regurgitant volume and fraction were measured using two simultaneous methods (quantitative Doppler echocardiography and quantitative two-dimensional echocardiography); the intensity of the regurgitant murmur (grade 0 to 6) was noted by physicians unaware of the study. Correlations between murmur intensity and regurgitant volume and fraction were good in aortic regurgitation (r = .60 and r = .67, respectively; P < 0.001) and mitral regurgitation (r = .64 and r = .67, respectively; P < 0.001) but weaker (r = .47 and r = .45, respectively) in the subset of mitral regurgitation of ischemic or functional cause. Murmur intensity grades > or = 3 for aortic regurgitation and > or = 4 for mitral regurgitation predicted severe regurgitation (regurgitant fraction > or = 40%) in 71% and 91% of patients, respectively. Murmur grades < or = 1 for aortic regurgitation and < or = 2 for mitral regurgitation predicted ""not severe"" regurgitation in 100% and 88% of patients, respectively. Murmur grades 2 for aortic regurgitation and 3 for mitral regurgitation were not correlated to degree of regurgitation. The severity of regurgitation was the most powerful determinant of intensity of murmur. Murmur intensity correlates well with the degree of chronic organic aortic and mitral regurgitation, and can be used as a predictor of regurgitation severity and as a simple guideline for diagnostic testing in these patients.","In a prospective study testing the ability of physical examination to identify severe mitral regurgitation, 170 consecutive patients with mitral regurgitation assessed by echocardiography underwent a clinical examination by internists or cardiologists blinded to the echocardiogram findings. The negative predictive value for absence of severe mitral regurgitation with a murmur less than grade III ranged from 88% to 100%. Murmurs greater than grade III had a predictive value of 91% for severe mitral regurgitation. Grade III murmurs were not predictive of severity."
"What is the appropriate evaluation and treatment of children who are ""toe walkers""
Children who toe-walk can pose a diagnostic problem. The differential diagnosis includes mild spastic diplegia and idiopathic toe-walking. Clinical differentiation between these two patient groups can be particularly difficult, and there are no objective diagnostic tests to assist the clinician. We assessed 50 children who toe-walk to define the kinematic patterns of lower-limb joint motion in the sagittal plane. There were 23 children with mild spastic diplegia. 22 idiopathic toe-walkers, and five normal children who were asked to toe-walk. We found characteristic patterns of knee and ankle motion that differentiated spastic diplegia from idiopathic toe-walking. Normal children asked to toe-walk had the same pattern as the idiopathic group. Gait analysis is a diagnostic tool that enables the clinician objectively to differentiate mild spastic diplegia from idiopathic toe-walking.","In a study (23 children with mild cerebral palsy and 22 with idiopathic toe-walking), maximal knee extension occurred at ground contact in the idiopathic toe-walking group whereas in the mild cerebral palsy group, the knee was flexed at ground contact."
"Does psychiatric treatment help patients with intractable chronic pain
To carry out a systematic review of the literature examining the efficacy of psychological interventions (e.g., relaxation, biofeedback, cognitive-behavioral therapy) in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Studies that met the following criteria were included: random assignment, wait-list or usual care control condition; publication in peer-reviewed journals; treatment that included some psychological component beyond simply providing education information; and separate data provided for patients with RA if subjects with conditions other than RA were included. Two investigators independently extracted data on study design, sample size and characteristics, type of intervention, type of control, direction and nature of the outcome(s). Twenty-five trials met the inclusion criteria. Methodologic quality was assessed, and effect sizes were calculated for 6 outcomes. Significant pooled effect sizes were found postintervention for pain (0.22), functional disability (0.27), psychological status (0.15), coping (0.46), and self efficacy (0.35). At followup (averaging 8.5 months), significant pooled effect sizes were observed for tender joints (0.33), psychological status (0.30), and coping (0.52). No clear or consistent patterns emerged when effect sizes for different types of treatment and control conditions were compared, or when higher quality trials were compared to lower quality ones. Findings do, however, suggest that these psychological interventions may be more effective for patients who have had the illness for shorter duration. Despite some methodologic flaws in the literature, psychological interventions may be important adjunctive therapies in the medical management of RA.","For rheumatoid arthritis alone, a systematic review of 19 studies found cognitive therapies had a small but statistically significant effect on pain, functional disability, depression, coping, and self-efficacy for 1298 patients at initial follow-up. However, only ""tender points"" and coping remained improved at subsequent follow-ups averaging 8.5 months."
"How useful is a physical exam in diagnosing testicular torsion
To compare historical features, physical examination findings, and testicular color Doppler ultrasound in pediatric patients with epididymitis, testicular torsion, and torsion of appendix testis. A retrospective review of patients with the diagnosis of epididymitis, testicular torsion, or torsion of appendix testis. Ninety patients were included in the study (64 with epididymitis, 13 with testicular torsion, and 13 with torsion of appendix testis). Historical features did not differ among groups except for duration of symptoms. Of 13 patients with testicular torsion all had a tender testicle and an absent cremasteric reflex. When compared with the testicular torsion group, fewer patients with epididymitis had a tender testicle (69%) or an absent cremasteric reflex (14%). 62 (97%) patients with epididymitis had a tender epididymis and 43 (67%) had scrotal erythema/edema. By comparison, 3 (23%) and 5 (38%) patients with testicular torsion had a tender epididymis or scrotal erythema/edema, respectively. Doppler ultrasound showed decreased or absent blood flow in 8 patients, 7 of whom were diagnosed with testicular torsion. Ten out of 13 patients with testicular torsion had a salvageable testicle at the time of surgery. The physical examination is helpful in distinguishing among epididymitis, testicular torsion, and torsion of appendix testis. Patients presenting with a tender testicle and an absent cremasteric reflex were more likely to have a testicular torsion rather than epididymitis or torsion of appendix testis. An absent cremasteric reflex was the most sensitive physical finding for diagnosing testicular torsion. Color Doppler ultrasound is a useful adjunct in the evaluation of the acute scrotum when physical findings are equivocal.","The presence or absence of physical exam findings-such as abnormal testicular lie has 46% sensitivity, 99% specificity."
"Does heat or cold work better for acute muscle strain
Closed soft tissue injury induces progressive microvascular dysfunction and regional inflammation. The authors tested the hypothesis that adverse trauma-induced effects can be reduced by local cooling. While superficial cooling reduces swelling, pain, and cellular oxygen demand, the effects of cryotherapy on posttraumatic microcirculation are incompletely understood. Controlled laboratory study. After a standardized closed soft tissue injury to the left tibial compartment, male rats were randomly subjected to percutaneous perfusion for 6 hours with 0.9% NaCL (controls; room temperature) or cold NaCL (cryotherapy; 8 degrees C) (n = 7 per group). Uninjured rats served as shams (n = 7). Microcirculatory changes and leukocyte adherence were determined by intravital microscopy. Intramuscular pressure was measured, and invasion of granulocytes and macrophages was assessed by immunohistochemistry. Edema and tissue damage was quantified by gravimetry and decreased desmin staining. Closed soft tissue injury significantly decreased functional capillary density (240 +/- 12 cm(-1)); increased microvascular permeability (0.75 +/- 0.03), endothelial leukocyte adherence (995 +/- 77/cm(2)), granulocyte (182.0 +/- 25.5/mm(2)) and macrophage infiltration, edema formation, and myonecrosis (ratio: 2.95 +/- 0.45) within the left extensor digitorum longus muscle. Cryotherapy for 6 hours significantly restored diminished functional capillary density (393 +/- 35), markedly decreased elevated intramuscular pressure, reduced the number of adhering (462 +/- 188/cm(2)) and invading granulocytes (119 +/- 28), and attenuated tissue damage (ratio: 1.7 +/- 0.17). The hypothesis that prolonged cooling reduces posttraumatic microvascular dysfunction, inflammation, and structural impairment was confirmed. These results may have therapeutic implications as cryotherapy after closed soft tissue injury is a valuable therapeutic approach to improve nutritive perfusion and attenuate leukocyte-mediated tissue destruction. The risk for evolving compartment syndrome may be reduced, thereby preventing further irreversible aggravation.","A study of 21 rats showed improvement in associated physiological components with cryotherapy, but no statistically significant improvement in edema."
"Does daily monitoring of blood glucose predict hemoglobin A1c levels
To evaluate the relative value of plasma glucose (PG) at different time points in assessing glucose control of type 2 diabetic patients. Glycemic profiles, i.e., PG at prebreakfast (8:00 A.M.), prelunch (11:00 A.M.), postlunch (2:00 P.M.), and extended postlunch (5:00 P.M.) times over the same day, were obtained in 66 type 2 diabetic patients on an ambulatory basis. The different time points of PG were compared with a measurement of HbA1c made in a reference laboratory. Extended postlunch PG was lower than prebreakfast PG (104 +/- 21 vs. 133 +/- 35 mg/dl, P < 0.02) in patients demonstrating good diabetic control (HbA1c < or = 7.0%), was not different from prebreakfast PG (149 +/- 47 vs. 166 +/- 26 mg/dl, NS) in patients demonstrating fair diabetic control (7.0% < HbA1c < or = 8.5%), and was higher than prebreakfast PG (221 +/- 62 vs. 199 +/- 49 mg/dl, P < or = 0.01) in those demonstrating poor diabetic control (HbA1c < or = 8.5%). Prebreakfast, prelunch, postlunch, and extended postlunch PG values were all significantly correlated with HbA1c. Multiple linear regression analysis demonstrated that postlunch PG and extended postlunch PG correlated significantly and independently with HbA1c, but that prebreakfast PG and prelunch PG did not. Moreover, postlunch PG and extended postlunch PG demonstrated better sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value in predicting poor glycemic control than did prebreakfast PG or prelunch PG. In type 2 diabetes, postlunch PG and extended postlunch PG are better predictors of glycemic control than fasting plasma glucose (FPG). We therefore suggest that they be more widely used to supplement, or substitute for, FPG in evaluating the metabolic control of type 2 diabetic patients.","No consistent difference was shown between preprandial and postprandial blood glucose levels in their strength of association with HbA1c levels. In 1 of these studies, a blood glucose level of 150 mg/dL 2 hours after lunch predicted a HbA1c of 7% with 85% sensitivity and 85% specificity."
"How should you manage a depressed patient unresponsive to an SSRI
After unsuccessful treatment for depression with a selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), it is not known whether switching to one antidepressant is more effective than switching to another. We randomly assigned 727 adult outpatients with a nonpsychotic major depressive disorder who had no remission of symptoms or could not tolerate the SSRI citalopram to receive one of the following drugs for up to 14 weeks: sustained-release bupropion (239 patients) at a maximal daily dose of 400 mg, sertraline (238 patients) at a maximal daily dose of 200 mg, or extended-release venlafaxine (250 patients) at a maximal daily dose of 375 mg. The study was conducted in 18 primary and 23 psychiatric care settings. The primary outcome was symptom remission, defined by a total score of 7 or less on the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD-17) at the end of the study. Scores on the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology - Self Report (QIDS-SR-16), obtained at treatment visits, determined secondary outcomes, including remission (a score of 5 or less at exit) and response (a reduction of 50 percent or more on baseline scores). Remission rates as assessed by the HRSD-17 and the QIDS-SR-16, respectively, were 21.3 percent and 25.5 percent for sustained-release bupropion, 17.6 percent and 26.6 percent for sertraline, and 24.8 percent and 25.0 percent for extended-release venlafaxine. QIDS-SR-16 response rates were 26.1 percent for sustained-release bupropion, 26.7 percent for sertraline, and 28.2 percent for extended-release venlafaxine. These treatments did not differ significantly with respect to outcomes, tolerability, or adverse events. After unsuccessful treatment with an SSRI, approximately one in four patients had a remission of symptoms after switching to another antidepressant. Any one of the medications in the study provided a reasonable second-step choice for patients with depression. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00021528.).","The strongest evidence is from the recent sequenced treatment alternatives to relieve depression trial, a randomized study that assigned patients in one arm of the study who had no relief from (or did not tolerate) therapy with citalopram (Celexa) to 1 of 3 drugs-sustained-release bupropion (Wellbutrin SR), sertraline (Zoloft), or extended-release venlafaxine (Effexor XR). The study concluded that approximately 1 in 4 patients have remission after switching to an antidepressant from another drug class."
"Which nondrug alternatives can help with insomnia
Recognition that psychological and behavioral factors play an important role in insomnia has led to increased interest in therapies targeting these factors. A review paper published in 1999 summarized the evidence regarding the efficacy of psychological and behavioral treatments for persistent insomnia. The present review provides an update of the evidence published since the original paper. As with the original paper, this review was conducted by a task force commissioned by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine in order to update its practice parameters on psychological and behavioral therapies for insomnia. A systematic review was conducted on 37 treatment studies (N = 2246 subjects/patients) published between 1998 and 2004 inclusively and identified through Psyclnfo and Medline searches. Each study was systematically reviewed with a standard coding sheet and the following information was extracted: Study design, sample (number of participants, age, gender), diagnosis, type of treatments and controls, primary and secondary outcome measures, and main findings. Criteria for inclusion of a study were as follows: (a) the main sleep diagnosis was insomnia (primary or comorbid), (b) at least 1 treatment condition was psychological or behavioral in content, (c) the study design was a randomized controlled trial, a nonrandomized group design, a clinical case series or a single subject experimental design with a minimum of 10 subjects, and (d) the study included at least 1 of the following as dependent variables: sleep onset latency, number and/or duration of awakenings, total sleep time, sleep efficiency, or sleep quality. Psychological and behavioral therapies produced reliable changes in several sleep parameters of individuals with either primary insomnia or insomnia associated with medical and psychiatric disorders. Nine studies documented the benefits of insomnia treatment in older adults or for facilitating discontinuation of medication among chronic hypnotic users. Sleep improvements achieved with treatment were well sustained over time; however, with the exception of reduced psychological symptoms/ distress, there was limited evidence that improved sleep led to clinically meaningful changes in other indices of morbidity (e.g., daytime fatigue). Five treatments met criteria for empirically-supported psychological treatments for insomnia: Stimulus control therapy, relaxation, paradoxical intention, sleep restriction, and cognitive-behavior therapy. These updated findings provide additional evidence in support of the original review's conclusions as to the efficacy and generalizability of psychological and behavioral therapies for persistent insomnia. Nonetheless, further research is needed to develop therapies that would optimize outcomes and reduce morbidity, as would studies of treatment mechanisms, mediators, and moderators of outcomes. Effectiveness studies are also needed to validate those therapies when implemented in clinical settings (primary care), by non-sleep specialists. There is also a need to disseminate more effectively the available evidence in support of psychological and behavioral interventions to health-care practitioners working on the front line.","Five high-quality randomized control trials (RCTs) confirmed findings from earlier RCTs that cognitive-behavioral treatment methods improve sleep. Compared with those given a placebo or placed on a waiting list, CBT-treated patients in these RCTs reported clinically significant improvements in sleep onset latency, sleep efficiency, time awake after sleep onset, and total sleep time. In one RCT, 64% of cognitive-behavioral treatment patients had improvements in sleep efficiency and time awake after sleep onset, compared with 8% who improved with a placebo intervention (number needed to treat [NNT]=1.8). Further, sleep onset latency for primary care patients with chronic insomnia was decreased from 61 to 28 minutes, compared with 74 to 70 minutes for a waiting-list group."
"Do calcium supplements prevent postmenopausal osteoporotic fractures
The analysis of clinical trials investigating the effect of calcium on the loss of bone mass or density has been based on the assumption that the effects are the same for all years of follow-up. Hence the average annual rate of loss is calculated and compared in the calcium and control groups. In this metaanalysis, we investigated this assumption and found that it is not tenable in the groups randomized to calcium for most sites that have been measured. The rate of bone loss was significantly less in the first year after randomization than in the second year. By contrast, the rate of loss in the control groups was less in the second year than the first, although this was not significant. At the spine, femoral neck, trochanter, intertrochanter, midtibia, and ultratibia, the effect of calcium in reducing bone loss was statistically significant compared with control only in the first year after randomization; there was no difference in rates between the groups in the second year. The effect of calcium compared to control in two arm sites and Ward's triangle was of a similar magnitude but was not statistically significant. We recommend that analysis and metaanalysis of trials should always consider the effects on a year-by-year basis.",The effect may be greatest in the first year of supplementation and less in subsequent years.
"What are effective treatments for oppositional defiant behaviors in adolescents
To determine whether family and parenting interventions benefit children and adolescents with conduct disorder and delinquency. Meta-analysis of eight randomised controlled trials involving 749 children and adolescents (aged 10-17 years) with conduct disorder and/or delinquency. Criminality, academic performance, future employment, problem behaviour, family functioning, parental mental health, and peer relations were evaluated. Family and parenting interventions significantly reduced the time spent by juvenile delinquents in institutions (weighted mean difference 51.34 days). There was also a significant reduction in the risk of a juvenile delinquent being rearrested (relative risk 0.66) and in their rate of subsequent arrests at 1-3 years (standardised mean difference -0.56). The evidence suggests that family and parenting interventions for juvenile delinquents and their families have beneficial effects on reducing time spent in institutions and their criminal activity. In addition to the obvious benefit to the participant and their family, this may result in a cost saving for society.","A meta-analysis of 8 RCTs (with a total of 749 children) of various behavioral treatments for conduct disorder and juvenile delinquency among children aged 10 to 17 years found significant reductions in rearrest rates (relative risk [RR]=0.66; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.44-0.98; number needed to treat [NNT] to prevent 1 rearrest=3.7) and time spent in institutions (mean difference, 51 days) with family and parenting interventions (comprising 1 to 6 months of individual and group parenting training, short and long-term family therapy, and individual and group adolescent interventions)."
"Does physical therapy improve symptoms of fibromyalgia
The efficacy of an integrated, psychological treatment program was tested in a controlled study involving 27 patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain (fibromyalgia). The experimental treatment program consisted of instruction in various self-help techniques (e.g., cognitive behavioral strategies, relaxation, physical exercises) as well as information on chronic pain. Control groups were instructed only in autogenic training. Measures of pain, daily activities, general symptoms, and psychological functioning were assessed before and after treatment, as well as at 4 months after termination of therapy (follow-up). At the end of treatment, 7 patients from the experimental group and 2 from the control group showed significant clinical improvement in 3 of 6 parameters (NS). At follow-up, the improvement was still present in 5 experimental cases but in none of the controls (p = 0.024). Successful patients had been sick for a shorter period of time and were less impaired by their condition. Psychological interventions in combination with physiotherapy can be effective in treating fibromyalgia patients, especially if applied early.","Keel and colleagues found no immediate treatment benefit following 15 weeks of education, cognitive behavioral therapy, and exercise vs relaxation training in their small randomized controlled trial."
"Does birth weight predict childhood obesity
Obesity increases risk of many adverse outcomes, but its early origins are obscure. Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) reflects a metabolically altered fetal environment associated with high birth weight, itself associated with later obesity. Previous studies of GDM and offspring obesity, however, have been few and conflicting. The objectives of this study were to examine associations of birth weight and GDM with adolescent body mass index (BMI) and to determine the extent to which the effect of GDM is explained by its influence on birth weight or by maternal adiposity. We conducted a survey of 7981 girls and 6900 boys, 9 to 14 years of age, who are participants in the Growing Up Today Study, a US nationwide study of diet, activity, and growth. In 1996, participants reported height, weight, diet, activity, and other variables by self-administered mailed questionnaire. We linked these data with information reported by their mothers, participants in the Nurses' Health Study II, including GDM, height, current weight, and child's birth weight. We excluded births <34 weeks' gestation and mothers who had preexisting diabetes. We defined overweight as BMI (kg/m(2)) >95th percentile, and at risk for overweight as 85th to 95th percentile, for age and gender from US national data. Mean birth weight was 3.4 kg for girls and 3.6 kg for boys. Among the 465 subjects whose mothers had GDM, 17.1% were at risk for overweight and 9.7% were overweight in early adolescence. In the group without maternal diabetes, these estimates were 14.2% and 6.6%, respectively. In multiple logistic regression analysis, controlling for age, gender, and Tanner stage, the odds ratio for adolescent overweight for each 1-kg increment in birth weight was 1.4 (95% confidence interval: 1.2-1.6). Adjustment for physical activity, television watching, energy intake, breastfeeding duration, mother's BMI, and other maternal and family variables reduced the estimate to 1.3 (1.1-1.5). For offspring of mothers with GDM versus no diabetes, the odds ratio for adolescent overweight was 1.4 (1.1-2.0), which was unchanged after controlling for energy balance and socioeconomic factors. Adjustment for birth weight slightly attenuated the estimate (1.3; 0.9-1.9); adjustment for maternal BMI reduced the odds ratio to 1.2 (0.8-1.7). Higher birth weight predicted increased risk of overweight in adolescence. Having been born to a mother with GDM was also associated with increased adolescent overweight. However, the effect of GDM on offspring obesity seemed only partially explained by its influence on birth weight, and adjustment for mother's own BMI attenuated the GDM associations. Our results only modestly support a causal role of altered maternal-fetal glucose metabolism in the genesis of obesity in the offspring. Alternatively, GDM may program risk for a postnatal insult leading to obesity, or it may merely be a risk marker, not in the causal pathway.","A retrospective cohort survey of 14,881 children born to mothers with gestational diabetes-and controlled for age, sex, and Tanner stage-found that the odds ratio (OR) for adolescent overweight was 1.4 (95% CI, 1.2-1.6) for each 1-kg increment in birth weight. The correlation persisted (OR=1.3; 95% CI, 1.1-1.5) when other covariates were controlled (television viewing, physical activity, energy intake, breastfeeding duration, birth order, household income, mother's smoking, dietary restraint, and mother's current BMI)."
"Is methylphenidate useful for treating adolescents with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
This practice parameter describes treatment with stimulant medication. It uses an evidence-based medicine approach derived from a detailed literature review and expert consultation. Stimulant medications in clinical use include methylphenidate, dextroamphetamine, mixed-salts amphetamine, and pemoline. It carries FDA indications for treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and narcolepsy.","The American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry AACAP supports the prescribing of methylphenidate in adolescents with ADHD. Given the unique psychosocial, environmental, and scheduling challenges of adolescence, the AACAP mentions extended-release methylphenidate as ""well-suited for treatment of adolescents.""."
"What is the best way to treat tinea cruris
The estimated lifetime risk of acquiring a dermatophyte infection is between 10 and 20 percent. Recognition and appropriate treatment of these infections reduces both morbidity and discomfort and lessens the possibility of transmission. Dermatophyte infections are classified according to the affected body site, such as tinea capitis (scalp), tinea barbae (beard area), tinea corporis (skin other than bearded area, scalp, groin, hands or feet), tinea cruris (groin, perineum and perineal areas), tinea pedis (feet), tinea manuum (hands) and tinea unguium (nails). To determine the best treatment approach, the physician must consider several factors: (1) the anatomic locations of the infection, (2) the safety, efficacy and cost of treatment options and (3) the likelihood that the patient will comply with treatment. Newer medications in both oral and topical forms, including imidazoles and allylamines, have greatly increased the cure rate for tinea infections. Certain types of tinea may be treated with ""pulse"" regimens; these innovative therapies lower treatment costs and improve patient compliance.",The American Academy of Family Physicians recommends any of the topical antifungal treatments as first-line treatment for tinea cruris.
"Does digoxin decrease morbidity for those in sinus rhythm with heart failure
The role of cardiac glycosides in treating patients with chronic heart failure and normal sinus rhythm remains controversial. We studied the effect of digoxin on mortality and hospitalization in a randomized, double-blind clinical trial. In the main trial, patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 0.45 or less were randomly assigned to digoxin (3397 patients) or placebo (3403 patients) in addition to diuretics and angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (median dose of digoxin, 0.25 mg per day; average follow-up, 37 months). In an ancillary trial of patients with ejection fractions greater than 0.45, 492 patients were randomly assigned to digoxin and 496 to placebo. In the main trial, mortality was unaffected. There were 1181 deaths (34.8 percent) with digoxin and 1194 deaths (35.1 percent) with placebo (risk ratio when digoxin was compared with placebo, 0.99; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.91 to 1.07; P=0.80). In the digoxin group, there was a trend toward a decrease in the risk of death attributed to worsening heart failure (risk ratio, 0.88; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.77 to 1.01; P=0.06). There were 6 percent fewer hospitalizations overall in that group than in the placebo group, and fewer patients were hospitalized for worsening heart failure (26.8 percent vs. 34.7 percent; risk ratio, 0.72; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.66 to 0.79; P<0.001). In the ancillary trial, the findings regarding the primary combined outcome of death or hospitalization due to worsening heart failure were consistent with the results of the main trial. Digoxin did not reduce overall mortality, but it reduced the rate of hospitalization both overall and for worsening heart failure. These findings define more precisely the role of digoxin in the management of chronic heart failure.","Increased rates of supraventricular dysrhythmias (RR=2.08; 95% CI, 1.44-2.99; number needed to harm [NNH]=77) and second- and third-degree heart block were demonstrated for patients receiving digoxin (RR=2.93; 95% CI, 1.61-5.34; NNH=125)."
"Do calcium supplements prevent postmenopausal osteoporotic fractures
We tested the spine antifracture and bone sparing efficacy of 1.2 g/day of oral calcium as carbonate in two groups of elderly women, one with prevalent fractures (PF, n = 94) on entry and the other without (NPF, n = 103). It was a prospective randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in mostly rural communities in women over age 60 who were living independently and were consuming < 1 g/day of calcium. We obtained annual lateral spine radiographs and semiannual forearm bone density over 4.3 +/- 1.1 years and determined vertebral fractures by radiographic morphometry augmented by physician assessment. In the PF group, 15 of 53 subjects on calcium had incident fractures, compared with 21 of 41 on placebo (p = 0.023, chi2). Calcium did not reduce the rate of incident fractures in the NPF group. Those with a prevalent fracture on entry and not treated with calcium were 2.8 times more likely to experience an incident fracture than all others. Change in the forearm bone mass on placebo in the PF group was -1.24 +/- 2.41%/year compared with +0.31 +/- 1.80%/year on calcium (p < 0.001). In the NPF group, the difference was less: -0.39 +/- 2.08%/year versus 0.00 +/- 1.64%/year (p = 0.2). We conclude that in elderly postmenopausal women with spine fractures and selfselected calcium intakes of < 1 g/day, a calcium supplement of 1.2 g/day reduces the incidence of spine fractures and halts measurable bone loss.",A randomized controlled trial in post-menopausal women with low calcium intake and previous vertebral fractures showed that 1200 mg of calcium supplementation reduced the incidence of additional fractures (RR=0.23).
"What physical exam techniques are useful to detect malingering
Psychophysiological recordings (electrodermal activity, heart rate, respiration rate and frontalis and back muscle tension) were taken in chronic low back pain (CLBP) patients and control subjects during baseline conditions and during the presentation of six acute pressure pain stimuli. No baseline differences in back muscle tension between CLBP patients and controls were found, but CLBP patients did have higher baseline electrodermal activity. During pain stimulation, CLBP patients showed larger skin conductance reactions than controls. Also, the CLBP patient group showed a marked increase in lumbar muscle tension during the test compared to baseline, whereas the EMG level of the control group remained unchanged. This increase in muscle tension seemed to be more related to the postural change than to the pain stimulus, and it is hypothesized that some CLBP patients react with exaggerated and non-functional back muscle contractions to slight changes in posture. Contrary to expectation, no differences were found between CLBP patients and controls in physiological habituation after repeating the pain stimulus. Comparison of subjective pain ratings and psychophysiological variables showed that for control subjects arousal and subjective pain were related. For CLBP patients there was no such clear relationship.","A small, diagnostic case-control study of Mankopf's test, which is based on the theory that pain increases heart rate, investigated 20 chronic low back pain patients considered nonorganic vs 20 pain-free controls using mechanical pain stimulus applied to subjects' fingers. There was no significant difference in heart rate response between groups, and no significant effect of pain on heart rate in either group. The authors did not define their criteria for determining patients' back pain as non-organic, nor did they include patients with low back pain caused by an identifiable pathology. There was no mention of blinding. This literature search found no published studies of McBride's test, where the patient's refusal to stand on the unaffected leg and flex the affected leg to the chest determines a feigned radiculopathy."
"Should we screen women for hypothyroidism
The original Whickham Survey documented the prevalence of thyroid disorders in a randomly selected sample of 2779 adults which matched the population of Great Britain in age, sex and social class. The aim of the twenty-year follow-up survey was to determine the incidence and natural history of thyroid disease in this cohort. Subjects were traced at follow-up via the Electoral Register, General Practice registers, Gateshead Family Health Services Authority register and Office of Population Censuses and Surveys. Eight hundred and twenty-five subjects (30% of the sample) had died and, in addition to death certificates, two-thirds had information from either hospital/General Practitioner notes or post-mortem reports to document morbidity prior to death. Of the 1877 known survivors, 96% participated in the follow-up study and 91% were tested for clinical, biochemical and immunological evidence of thyroid dysfunction. Outcomes in terms of morbidity and mortality were determined for over 97% of the original sample. The mean incidence (with 95% confidence intervals) of spontaneous hypothyroidism in women was 3.5/1000 survivors/year (2.8-4.5) rising to 4.1/1000 survivors/year (3.3-5.0) for all causes of hypothyroidism and in men was 0.6/1000 survivors/year (0.3-1.2). The mean incidence of hyperthyroidism in women was 0.8/1000 survivors/year (0.5-1.4) and was negligible in men. Similar incidence rates were calculated for the deceased subjects. An estimate of the probability of the development of hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism at a particular time, i.e. the hazard rate, showed an increase with age in hypothyroidism but no age relation in hyperthyroidism. The frequency of goitre decreased with age with 10% of women and 2% of men having a goitre at follow-up, as compared to 23% and 5% in the same subjects respectively at the first survey. The presence of a goitre at either survey was not associated with any clinical or biochemical evidence of thyroid dysfunction. In women, an association was found between the development of a goitre and thyroid-antibody status at follow-up, but not initially. The risk of having developed hypothyroidism at follow-up was examined with respect to risk factors identified at first survey. The odds ratios (with 95% confidence intervals) of developing hypothyroidism with (a) raised serum TSH alone were 8 (3-20) for women and 44 (19-104) for men; (b) positive anti-thyroid antibodies alone were 8 (5-15) for women and 25 (10-63) for men; (c) both raised serum TSH and positive anti-thyroid antibodies were 38 (22-65) for women and 173 (81-370) for men. A logit model indicated that increasing values of serum TSH above 2mU/l at first survey increased the probability of developing hypothyroidism which was further increased in the presence of anti-thyroid antibodies. Neither a positive family history of any form of thyroid disease nor parity of women at first survey was associated with increased risk of developing hypothyroidism. Fasting cholesterol and triglyceride levels at first survey when corrected for age showed no association with the development of hypothyroidism in women. This historical cohort study has provided incidence data for thyroid disease over a twenty-year period for a representative cross-sectional sample of the population, and has allowed the determination of the importance of prognostic risk factors for thyroid disease identified twenty years earlier.",A study followed 2779 adults (1494 women) with all types of thyroid disease for 20 years and found that 55% of women with thyroid-stimulating hormone >6 and a positive antibody test developed overt hypothyroidism. Ninety percent of patients with an initial thyroid-stimulating hormone >10 eventually progressed to overt disease.
"What is the clinical workup for failure to thrive
Failure to thrive is a common problem in infancy and childhood. It is most often multifactorial in origin. Inadequate nutrition and disturbed social interactions contribute to poor weight gain, delayed development, and abnormal behavior. The syndrome develops in a significant number of children as a consequence of child neglect. This clinical report is intended to focus the pediatrician on the consideration, evaluation, and management of failure to thrive when child neglect may be present. Child protective services agencies should be notified when the evaluation leads to a suspicion of abuse or neglect.","A detailed prenatal history (including birth weight and pregnancy complications) and medical history for both the child and parents can identify underlying metabolic, endocrine, or familial disorders. It is always important to look for signs of child abuse, because children with failure to thrive are more likely to be victims of abuse than normal-weight peers."
"Do acetaminophen and an nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs combined relieve osteoarthritis pain better than either alone
To determine the efficacy, gastrointestinal safety, and tolerability of celecoxib (a cyclo-oxygenase 2 (COX 2) inhibitor) used in the treatment of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Systematic review of randomised trials that compared at least 12 weeks' celecoxib treatment with another non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) or placebo and reported efficacy, tolerability, or safety. Trials identified from manufacturer and by searching electronic databases and evaluated according to predefined inclusion and quality criteria. Data combined through meta-analysis. 15 187 patients with osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis. Efficacy: Western Ontario and McMaster universities osteoarthritis index; American College of Rheumatology responder index and joint scores for rheumatoid arthritis. Tolerability: withdrawal rates for adverse effects. Gastrointestinal safety: incidence of ulcers, bleeds, perforations, and obstructions. Nine randomised controlled trials were included. Celecoxib and NSAIDS were equally effective for all efficacy outcomes. Compared with those taking other NSAIDs, in patients taking celecoxib the rate of withdrawals due to adverse gastrointestinal events was 46% lower (95% confidence interval 29% to 58%; NNT 35 at three months), the incidence of ulcers detectable by endoscopy was 71% lower (59% to 79%; NNT 6 at three months), and the incidence of symptoms of ulcers, perforations, bleeds, and obstructions was 39% lower (4% to 61%; NNT 208 at six months). Subgroup analysis of patients taking aspirin showed that the incidence of ulcers detected by endoscopy was reduced by 51% (14% to 72%) in those given celecoxib compared with other NSAIDs. The reduction was greater (73%, 52% to 84%) in those not taking aspirin. Celecoxib is as effective as other NSAIDs for relief of symptoms of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis and has significantly improved gastrointestinal safety and tolerability.",A systematic review of selective COX-2 inhibitors vs naproxen found fewer endoscopically detected ulcers in patients taking celecoxib but no difference in serious gastrointestinal bleeds.
"Alcoholic liver disease: Is acetaminophen safe
An unexpected clinical question has emerged in the treatment of pain or fever in the alcoholic patient: Is paracetamol a safe medication for the alcoholic patient? After decades of use in a variety of patients, sporadic reports suggest a relationship between liver injury and the use of paracetamol by alcoholic patients. We performed a systematic review of the medical literature to answer the question: Can administration of therapeutic doses of paracetamol cause hepatic injury in the alcoholic patient? After extensive data retrieval, each article in any language that involved the use of paracetamol by an alcoholic patient was abstracted and categorized for strength of evidence. Class I data (randomized, controlled trials) show that repeated ingestion of a therapeutic dose of paracetamol over 48 hours by patients with severe alcoholism did not produce an increase in hepatic aminotransferase enzyme levels nor any clinical manifestations compared with a placebo group. Class II data (prospective, nonrandomized trials) reveal that therapeutic doses of paracetamol have been administered to patients and an array of liver diseases (alcoholic, primary biliary, postnecrotic, or unspecified cirrhosis or alcoholic, acute viral, chronic active, or other infectious hepatitis) for periods up to 14 days without adverse effect. Finally, in several studies, a 1- to 2-g single dose of paracetamol was administered to alcoholic patients to study metabolism, again without adverse effect. In contrast, Class III data (retrospective case reviews and case reports) describe hepatic injury after repeated paracetamol ingestion with therapeutic intent, although usually not at therapeutic doses. Unfortunately, the information contained in Class III reports is often incomplete and contradictory. The history of ingestion is often unknown or contradicts other clinical information provided. For example, the history may indicate a therapeutic dose, but the serum paracetamol is elevated to levels only produced by ingestion much larger than the history indicates. In summary, all methodologically sound studies available indicate that therapeutic dosing of paracetamol to the alcoholic patient is not associated with hepatic injury. In fact, there is no change at all in hepatic aminotransferase enzymes, prothrombin time, or other biochemical parameters when compared with a placebo group in well-designed trials. Unless stronger evidence of a potentially dangerous interaction emerges, the use of paracetamol in the alcoholic patient is reasonable. During chronic treatment of pain, paracetamol may be preferred in the compliant alcoholic patients owing to the adverse effects associated with long-term use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents.","A systematic review (published in 2000) identified reports of acetaminophen toxicity, poisoning, or adverse events for alcohol patients. Researchers found 7 articles classified as Class I (studies utilizing randomized controlled trials) or Class 2 data (studies utilizing prospective, nonrandomized trials), and 20 articles that provided Class 3 data (retrospective case reviews and case reports). The studies of Class I and 2 data indicated therapeutic dosing of acetaminophen is safe for patients with liver disease, whereas the Class 3 (lower-quality) data suggest acetaminophen is toxic for patients with liver disease. This review concluded that, based on all the methodologically sound studies available (specifically those using the stronger evidence), therapeutic dosing of acetaminophen for the alcoholic patient is not associated with hepatic injury."
"How should we manage a patient with a positive PPD and prior BCG vaccination
The whole-blood interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) is recommended in some settings as an alternative to the tuberculin skin test (TST). Outcomes from field implementation of the IGRA for routine tuberculosis (TB) testing have not been reported. We evaluated feasibility, acceptability, and costs after 1.5 years of IGRA use in San Francisco under routine program conditions. Patients seen at six community clinics serving homeless, immigrant, or injection-drug user (IDU) populations were routinely offered IGRA (Quantiferon-TB). Per guidelines, we excluded patients who were <17 years old, HIV-infected, immunocompromised, or pregnant. We reviewed medical records for IGRA results and completion of medical evaluation for TB, and at two clinics reviewed TB screening logs for instances of IGRA refusal or phlebotomy failure. Between November 1, 2003 and February 28, 2005, 4143 persons were evaluated by IGRA. 225(5%) specimens were not tested, and 89 (2%) were IGRA-indeterminate. Positive or negative IGRA results were available for 3829 (92%). Of 819 patients with positive IGRA results, 524 (64%) completed diagnostic evaluation within 30 days of their IGRA test date. Among 503 patients eligible for IGRA testing at two clinics, phlebotomy was refused by 33 (7%) and failed in 40 (8%). Including phlebotomy, laboratory, and personnel costs, IGRA use cost $33.67 per patient tested. IGRA implementation in a routine TB control program setting was feasible and acceptable among homeless, IDU, and immigrant patients in San Francisco, with results more frequently available than the historically described performance of TST. Laboratory-based diagnosis and surveillance for M. tuberculosis infection is now possible.","A published report estimated the cost to the health care system per patient tested by a single interferon-gamma release assay as $33.67, compared with approximately $11 for PPD testing."
"How should we treat major depression combined with anxiety
Outcome of anxiety disorder treatment with psychotherapy and medication is generally as good as or better than that of other psychiatric illnesses. Nevertheless, refractory cases occur. The first step in approaching the treatment-resistant patient with an anxiety disorder is to be certain that the treatment has been adequate. Failure to provide an adequate dose of medication for adequate periods of time may be the most common cause of ""treatment resistance."" The second step is to reconsider the diagnosis and/or determine if new diagnoses have emerged since the original consultation. Depression and substance abuse are especially likely to complicate anxiety disorders. Several studies have shown that concomitant personality disorders (axis II) increase the occurrence of resistance to standard treatment and must be addressed through psychotherapy. Last, a variety of possible underlying medical conditions, including thyroid disorder, arrhythmia, and complex partial seizure, should be considered. Then, the clinician should consider a variety of pharmacologic approaches that are specific to each anxiety disorder. Panic disorder patients who are refractory to imipramine frequently respond to high-potency benzodiazepines, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or various combinations. Generalized anxiety disorder, if unresponsive to benzodiazepines, may respond to buspirone or a tricyclic antidepressant. Patients with obsessive compulsive disorder who have failed to respond to clomipramine or fluoxetine and other serotonin reuptake blockers may benefit from augmentation strategies using combination therapies including buspirone, fenfluramine, and neuroleptics. Social phobia refractory to beta-blockers and MAO inhibitors may benefit from buspirone, fenfluramine, and neuroleptics. Social phobia refractory to beta-blockers and MAO inhibitors may benefit from buspirone, fluoxetine, or alprazolam.","A review of 13 controlled clinical trials evaluated standardized depression and anxiety score reductions for patients with generalized anxiety disorder receiving cognitive behavioral therapy compared with various control treatments (waiting list, pill placebo, or alternative therapy-such as supportive listening psychotherapy). Approximately half of the patients were also taking medication (not specified). After an average of 10 sessions, cognitive behavioral therapy reduced anxiety and depression symptom scores more than control treatments (difference in effect size were 0.71 and 0.66, respectively). At 6- to 12-month follow-up, cognitive behavioral therapy gains were maintained (difference in effect size=0.30 for anxiety scores and 0.21 for depression scores). (An effect size of 0.2 is usually considered small, 0.5 moderate, and 0.8 is large.)"
"Does cranberry juice prevent or treat urinary tract infection
To determine whether recurrences of urinary tract infection can be prevented with cranberry-lingonberry juice or with Lactobacillus GG drink. Design: Open, randomised controlled 12 month follow up trial. Health centres for university students and staff of university hospital. 150 women with urinary tract infection caused by Escherichia coli randomly allocated into three groups. Interventions: 50 ml of cranberry-lingonberry juice concentrate daily for six months or 100 ml of lactobacillus drink five days a week for one year, or no intervention. Main outcome measure: First recurrence of symptomatic urinary tract infection, defined as bacterial growth >/=10(5 )colony forming units/ml in a clean voided midstream urine specimen. The cumulative rate of first recurrence of urinary tract infection during the 12 month follow up differed significantly between the groups (P=0.048). At six months, eight (16%) women in the cranberry group, 19 (39%) in the lactobacillus group, and 18 (36%) in the control group had had at least one recurrence. This is a 20% reduction in absolute risk in the cranberry group compared with the control group (95% confidence interval 3% to 36%, P=0.023, number needed to treat=5, 95% confidence interval 3 to 34). Regular drinking of cranberry juice but not lactobacillus seems to reduce the recurrence of urinary tract infection.","In women with prior Escherichia coli UTI, 50 mL of cranberry-lingonberry juice concentrate daily for 6 months reduced the recurrence of symptomatic urinary tract infection from 36% in the control group to 16% in the treated group (NNT=5)."
"What are the repercussions of disclosing a medical error
Mandatory disclosure of medical errors has been advocated to improve patient safety. Many resist mandatory disclosure policies because of concerns about increasing malpractice exposure. It has been countered that malpractice liability actually decreases when there is full disclosure of medical errors. A comprehensive literature search was conducted to determine what is known about the impact of full disclosure on malpractice liability. Electronic searches of multiple databases were supplemented with hand searches of bibliographies and communication with recognized experts in the field. Screening the titles, abstracts, and, in many cases, the full articles from more than an estimated 5,200 citations resulted in identification of one published study directly examining malpractice liability when a policy of full disclosure was implemented. Despite extensive literature on the impact of disclosure on malpractice liability, few well-designed studies have focused on the real-world impact on the volume and cost of suits following implementation of a full disclosure policy. Many articles examine why patients sue their doctors, suggesting that some lawsuits may be averted by disclosure, but the articles do not allow us to estimate the additional suits that would be created by disclosure. Additional studies addressing the effect of disclosure on malpractice liability are needed.",Very little evidence exists regarding the effect of disclosure on the likelihood of legal action in actual practice.
"What are contraindications to IUDs
Copper intrauterine contraceptive devices (IUCDs) were used in 243 young nulligravidae attending a gynaecological clinic for schoolgirls in Uppsala between March 1973 and June 1975; 226 of these girls (93%) were seen again during December 1975 making a total of 3138 months of observation. At the time of follow up, 126 patients (55.8%) still had the IUCD in situ; 20% had expelled the IUCD and in another 24.2% the IUCD had been removed because of bleeding and/or pain or because of suspected pelvic inflammatory disease (7 patients). Twelve of the girls conceived during the period of observation making the Pearl index 4.6; nine of the conceptions occurred within nine months of the insertion of the IUCD. Unlike others we do not advocate the use of the IUCD for young nulligravidae.","Nulliparous women have increased rates of discomfort with IUD placement (17.8% vs 8.8%) and may have an increased risk of expulsion (up to 18.5% in one study, compared with less than 5.7% for all IUD users)."
"What is the best treatment for plantar fasciitis
Three hundred two patients with chronic heel pain caused by proximal plantar fasciitis were enrolled in a study to assess the treatment effects consequent to administration of electrohydraulicall-generated extracorporeal shock waves. Symptoms had been present from 6 months to 18 years. Each treated patient satisfied numerous inclusion and exclusion criteria before he or she was accepted into this study, which was approved by the Food and Drug Administration as a randomized, double-blind evaluation of the efficacy of shock wave therapy for this disorder. Overall, at the predetermined evaluation period 3 months after one treatment, 56% more of the treated patients had a successful result by all four of the evaluation criteria when compared with the patients treated with a placebo. This difference was significant and corroborated the fact that this difference in the results was specifically attributable to the shock wave treatment, rather than any natural improvement caused by the natural history of the condition. The current study showed that the directed application of electrohydraulic-generated shock waves to the insertion of the plantar fascia onto the calcaneus is a safe and effective nonsurgical method for treating chronic, recalcitrant heel pain syndrome that has been present for at least 6 months and has been refractory to other commonly used nonoperative therapies. This technology, when delivered using the OssaTron (High Medical Technology, Kreuz-lingen, Switzerland), has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration specifically for the treatment of chronic proximal plantar fasciitis. The results suggest that this therapeutic modality should be considered before any surgical options, and even may be preferable to cortisone injection, which has a recognized risk of rupture of the plantar fascia and recurrence of symptoms.","A controlled and observer-blinded study of 302 patients with plantar fasciitis compared standard extracorporeal shock wave therapy with sham treatment. The treated patients had significantly lower pain scores (as measured on a visual analog scale) than the placebo group (1.9 vs 4.7). Three months post-treatment, half as many treated patients were taking pain medication when compared with placebo patients. After 1 year of follow-up, 94% of the treatment group patients were still pain-free, with a pain score of <2."
"Does lowering diastolic blood pressure to less than 90 mm Hg decrease cardiovascular risk
The aim of this study was to assess the cardiovascular risk in hypertensive subjects according to systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) levels. The study sample consisted of 4714 hypertensive men, treated by their physician, who had a standard health checkup at the d'Investigations Préventives et Cliniques Center, Paris, France, between 1972 and 1988. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality were assessed for a mean period of 14 years. Among treated subjects, 85.5% presented uncontrolled values for SBP (> or = 40 mm Hg) and/or DBP (> or = 90 mm Hg). After adjustment for age and associated risk factors, these subjects presented an increased risk for CVD mortality (risk ratio [RR], 1.66; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04-2.64) and for CHD mortality (RR, 2.35; 95% CI, 1.03-5.35) compared with controlled subjects. After adjustment for age, associated risk factors, and DBP, and compared with subjects with SBP under 140 mm Hg, the RR for CVD mortality was 1.81 (95% CI, 1.04-3.13) in subjects with SBP between 140 and 160 mm Hg and 1.94 (95% CI, 1.10-3.43) in subjects with SBP over 160 mm Hg. By contrast, after adjustment for SBP levels, CVD risk was not associated with DBP. Compared with subjects with DBP under 90 mm Hg, RR for CVD mortality was 1.17 (95% CI, 0.80-1.70) in subjects with DBP between 90 and 99 mm Hg and 1.03 (95% CI, 0.67-1.56) in subjects with DBP over 100 mm Hg. Similar results were observed for CHD mortality. In hypertensive men treated in clinical practice, SBP is a good predictor of CVD and CHD risk. Diastolic blood pressure, which remains the main criterion used by most physicians to determine drug efficacy, appears to be of little value in determining cardiovascular risk. Evaluation of risk in treated individuals should take SBP rather than DBP values into account.","A French cohort study followed over 4700 hyper-tensive men for an average of 14 years. These men had their hypertension treated in usual fashion by their own physicians. In this group, systolic blood pressure was much more accurate than diastolic blood pressure in classifying severity of hypertension and in predicting cardiovascular risk."
"Do nonmedicated topicals relieve childhood eczema
The incidence of refractory atopic dermatitis has increased in teenagers and young adults. The purpose of this study was to control the skin symptoms of such patients in daily life. Seventy patients repeatedly took a 10-min 42 degrees C acidic hot-spring bath twice daily. The skin symptoms were improved in 76% of cases. In 30 of 42 responders examined Staphylococcus aureus, detected on the skin surface, disappeared or decreased through balneotherapy. In contrast, S. aureus remained unchanged in 8 of 10 non-responders examined. Thus, the balneotherapy using acidic hot-spring water may be useful for controlling the skin symptoms of acute flares of refractory cases of atopic dermatitis.","In a case control study of 70 patients (ages 12-80 years, mean 23 years,) bathing in acidic hot spring water (42º C) helped control edema, erythema, exudation, and excoriation in refractory cases of eczema."
"Does stopping a statin increase the short-term risk of a cardiovascular event
For a variety of reasons, many patients abruptly discontinue statin therapy. The present analysis was conducted to determine whether the risk of cardiovascular outcomes increases after withdrawal of statin therapy in a stable cardiac population. In the Treating to New Target (TNT) study, 2 doses of atorvastatin (10 and 80 mg once daily) are being used in a double-blind parallel-group design. Of the 18,468 patients screened for study participation, 16,619 entered a dietary lead-in/drug-washout period, and of these, 15,432 eligible participants began treatment with atorvastatin 10 mg/d on an open-label basis. Of the subjects who entered the dietary lead-in/drug-washout period, 57% were receiving prior statin therapy. During the 6-week drug-washout period, there were 24 primary events (defined as coronary heart disease death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, resuscitated cardiac arrest, and fatal or nonfatal stroke); throughout the subsequent 8-week open-label period, there were 31 primary events. This equated to monthly Kaplan-Meier event rates of 0.20% during washout and 0.26% in the open-label phase. Event rates were therefore similar during the 2 phases. The present analysis demonstrates that short-term discontinuation of statin therapy in stable cardiac patients apparently does not lead to a clinically important increased risk of acute coronary syndromes.","A post-hoc analysis of the washout period of a prospective study of 9473 asymptomatic outpatients who were previously taking statins showed that for these lower-risk patients, similar rates of cardiovascular events could be expected during withdrawal (any statin) or initiation of atorvastatin therapy. The monthly event rate during the discontinuation phase was 0.20% and during initiation was 0.26% (P=NS)"
"Does early detection of suspected atherosclerotic renovascular hypertension change outcomes
Renal artery stenosis is increasingly being treated with the percutaneous insertion of stents. Little data are available to help select patients most likely to derive benefit from the procedure. Data were gathered on all patients treated with renal artery stent insertion at the Royal Melbourne Hospital prior to 1998, and who were followed-up for at least 6 months or until death. Multivariate regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with patient survival and renal survival (survival free of dialysis). Adequate data were available on 148 of 198 patients treated during this time (75%). A baseline creatinine over 0.15 mmol/L and age over 70 were strongly associated with worse patient survival (Likelihood ratio(LR) 9.96, p < 0.0001 and 3.4, p = 0.001 respectively) and renal survival (LR 7.8, p < 0.001 and 2.7, p < 0.01 respectively). The presence of diabetes was also associated with worse overall survival (LR 2.2, p < 0.05) but not renal survival, while the presence of another nephropathic disorder was associated with worse renal survival (LR 2.8, p < 0.01) but not overall survival. The use of ACE inhibitors after the stenting procedure was associated with a significantly better renal survival (LR 0.46, p < 0.05). Patients with baseline renal impairment, older age, diabetes or another coexistent renal disease have poor outcomes after renal artery stent insertion. A relatively conservative approach to revascularisation may be preferable in these patient groups. The use of ACE inhibitors after stent insertion is associated with a reduced likelihood of death or dialysis.","Worsened patient survival correlated with Cr >1.7 mg/dL or age >70 (OR=9.96, P<.0001 and OR=3.4, P=.001, respectively). Worsened renal survival was present in the same subgroups (OR=7.8, P<.001 and OR=2.7, P<.01, respectively)."
"Does neonatal circumcision decrease morbidity
The merits of neonatal circumcision continue to be debated hotly. Some argue that circumcision is a ""uniquely American medical enigma."" Most of the world's male population remains uncircumcised; however, most boys born in the United States continue to undergo neonatal circumcision. Review of existing literature supports that most children who are uncircumcised do well from a medical standpoint and, thus, the question of whether US health care practitioners are subjecting neonates to an unnecessary surgical procedure remains. The medical benefits of circumcision are multiple, but most are small. The clearest medical benefit of circumcision is the relative reduction in the risk for a UTI, especially in early infancy. Although this risk [figure: see text] is real, the absolute numbers are small (risk ranges from 1 in 100 to 1 in 1000), and one investigator has estimated that it may take approximately 80 neonatal circumcisions to prevent one UTI. In the case of a patient with known urologic abnormalities that predispose to UTI, neonatal circumcision has a clearer role in terms of medical benefit to the patient. Most of the other medical benefits of circumcision probably can be realized without circumcision as long as access to clean water and proper penile hygiene are achieved. Proper penile hygiene should all but eliminate the risk for foreskin-related medical problems that will require circumcision. Moreover, proper hygiene and access to clean water has been shown to reduce the rate of development of squamous cell carcinoma of the penis in the uncircumcised population. Proper techniques on the care of the foreskin are illustrated in the American Academy of Pediatrics pamphlet titled ""How to care for the uncircumcised penis."" Regarding the relationship between STDs and circumcision, patient education and the practice of low-risk sexual behavior make a far greater impact than does routine circumcision in hopes of reducing the spread of HIV and other STDs. Nevertheless, in areas where safe sexual practices are poorly adhered to, circumcision can have a relative protective effect against the transmission of HIV and other STDs. The medical harms of circumcision lie mainly in the 1% acute complication rate and the additional patients who require revision of their initial circumcision for cosmetic or medical reasons. Anecdotally, the authors see far fewer complications in the acute and long-term phase when the circumcision has been performed by someone with expertise and experience with the procedure. Thus, the authors routinely recommend to parents that, if they choose to have their newborns circumcised, they should seek out an experienced practitioner. A negative psychologic and sexual impact of circumcision has been argued, but solid, scientific data are lacking. Special interest groups have argued that perhaps the greatest harm of circumcision is in performing an operation without a clear indication. Many of these groups have claimed that performing a routine neonatal circumcision is akin to performing a surgical procedure without a clear medical benefit, and in an infant, that is akin to surgery without informed consent. Although this is an extreme posture, the clinician can understand the emphasis on trying to provide invasive medical services only when a clear medical benefit is expected, especially when treating an infant or child. Deciding whether or not to circumcise an infant continues to challenge many new parents. Clearly, the procedure provides potential medical benefits and potential risks. It is difficult to say whether the benefits outweigh the risks for all male infants. Further complicating the decision for many American parents is that, in some areas of the United States, there exists an unexplained positive cultural connotation with neonatal circumcision. For these reasons, parents who actively choose to keep their sons uncircumcised need to be encouraged to make this decision forthrightly. Parents who choose to have their children circumcised also should be encouraged to actively seek an experienced practitioner who can afford the child adequate local analgesia.",Evidence from case series supports the protective effect of circumcision on the rates of penile cancer. A review of 592 cases of penile cancer revealed that none of those affected had been circumcised in infancy.
"How should we manage infants at risk for group B streptococcal disease
To evaluate the relationship between the time elapsed from the administration of ampicillin prophylaxis to delivery and its efficacy in interrupting intrapartum transmission of group B streptococcus. During the 12-month study period, all women who came to the Virgen de las Nieves Hospital (Granada, Spain) for delivery were screened for group B streptococcus vaginal carriage by a pigment-detection culture-based procedure. Colonized women were treated with ampicillin (2 g intravenously), and the interval between ampicillin administration and delivery was recorded. Newborns from colonized mothers also were screened to detect group B streptococcus colonization. During the study period, 4525 women were admitted to the hospital for delivery and screened for group B streptococcus vaginal colonization. Group B streptococcus was detected in 543 women (12%), of whom 454 gave birth vaginally to 454 liveborn infants. Intrapartum ampicillin was given to 201 of these 454 women (44%), and 10% of the newborns from mothers who received intrapartum ampicillin prophylaxis were colonized by group B streptococcus. The relationship between timing of ampicillin administration and rate of neonatal group B streptococcal transmission was as follows: less than 1 hour before delivery, 46%; 1-2 hours, 29%; 2-4 hours, 2.9%; and more than 4 hours, 1.2%. Among the 253 mothers who received no intrapartum prophylaxis, colonization was found in 120 of their newborns (47%). When the time between the start of ampicillin prophylaxis and delivery is at least 2 hours, vertical transmission of group B streptococcus is minimized.","The vertical transmission rate of group B streptococcal disease, as measured by neonatal colonization (as opposed to clinical illness), is 46% when antibiotic prophylaxis is started <1 hour before delivery, 2.9% when prophylaxis is given at 2 to 4 hours, and 1.2% when given at least 4 hours before delivery."
"What interventions reduce the risk of contrast nephropathy for high-risk patients
Nephropathy induced by exposure to radiocontrast agents, a possible complication of percutaneous coronary interventions, is associated with significant in-hospital and long-term morbidity and mortality. Patients with preexisting renal failure are at particularly high risk. We investigated the role of hemofiltration, as compared with isotonic-saline hydration, in preventing contrast-agent-induced nephropathy in patients with renal failure. We studied 114 consecutive patients with chronic renal failure (serum creatinine concentration, >2 mg per deciliter [176.8 micromol per liter]) who were undergoing coronary interventions. We randomly assigned them to either hemofiltration in an intensive care unit (ICU) (58 patients, with a mean [+/-SD] serum creatinine concentration of 3.0+/-1.0 mg per deciliter [265.2+/-88.4 micromol per liter]) or isotonic-saline hydration at a rate of 1 ml per kilogram of body weight per hour given in a step-down unit (56 patients, with a mean serum creatinine concentration of 3.1+/-1.0 mg per deciliter [274.0+/-88.4 micromol per liter]). Hemofiltration (fluid replacement rate, 1000 ml per hour without weight loss) and saline hydration were initiated 4 to 8 hours before the coronary intervention and were continued for 18 to 24 hours after the procedure was completed. An increase in the serum creatinine concentration of more than 25 percent from the base-line value after the coronary intervention occurred less frequently among the patients in the hemofiltration group than among the control patients (5 percent vs. 50 percent, P<0.001). Temporary renal-replacement therapy (hemodialysis or hemofiltration) was required in 25 percent of the control patients and in 3 percent of the patients in the hemofiltration group. The rate of in-hospital events was 9 percent in the hemofiltration group and 52 percent in the control group (P<0.001). In-hospital mortality was 2 percent in the hemofiltration group and 14 percent in the control group (P=0.02), and the cumulative one-year mortality was 10 percent and 30 percent, respectively (P=0.01). In patients with chronic renal failure who are undergoing percutaneous coronary interventions, periprocedural hemofiltration given in an ICU setting appears to be effective in preventing the deterioration of renal function due to contrast-agent-induced nephropathy and is associated with improved in-hospital and long-term outcomes.","A single randomized controlled trials suggests that hemofiltration initiated 4 to 6 hours before contrast administration reduces the incidence of contrast nephropathy among high-risk patients. The study was unusual in that patients in the intervention group experienced statistically significant reductions in several clinically relevant outcomes, including in-hospital mortality and cumulative 1-year mortality (in-hospital mortality, NNT=8.3; cumulative 1-year mortality, NNT=5)."
"When and how should you evaluate a child for obstructive sleep apnea
Overnight polysomnography (PSG) has been used to diagnose and assess the severity of obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS) in children. The aim of this study was to determine whether home video-recording of children during sleep may be used for screening OSAS. In 58 children suspected of having OSAS, PSG results were compared with the corresponding analyses of 30 min video-recordings of each child sleeping at home. The video-recordings were evaluated by: 1) overall investigator's clinical judgement; and 2) a scoring system based on noisy breathing, movements, walking episodes, apnoea, chest retractions and mouth breathing. PSG results were highly correlated with the video test results, with agreement in 49 out of 58 (84%). In 36 of the 58 children, the PSG was abnormal compared with 41 out of 58 abnormal video tests. The sensitivity of the overall investigator judgement of video test was 94% (34 out of 36) and the specificity 68% (15 out of 22). Video scores > 10 were highly predictive of OSAS, whilst scores < 5 were associated with normality. Using a stepwise logistic regression analysis, each of the scoring variables was tested against the PSG results and an equation was formulated for predicting PSG by the video test. The equation predicted PSG results in 49 out of 58 (84%) cases. Thirty minutes of home video-recordings during sleep is a reliable screening method for obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome in children. This technique may, thus, improve patient selection for polysomnography.","A prospective cohort study of home sleep video recordings included 58 consecutive children who were 2 to 6 years of age with snoring or labored breathing during sleep. Parents filmed 30 minutes of sleep during ""worst breathing"" episodes. An expert investigator evaluated the recordings using both a standardized scoring system and subjective impression, and compared these with overnight polysomnography results, finding 94% sensitivity and 68% specificity."
"Which healthy adults should take aspirin
The use of aspirin to prevent cardiovascular disease events in patients without a history of cardiovascular disease is controversial. To examine the benefits and harms of aspirin chemoprevention. MEDLINE (1966 to May 2001). 1) Randomized trials at least 1 year in duration that examined aspirin chemoprevention in patients without previously known cardiovascular disease and 2) systematic reviews, recent trials, and observational studies that examined rates of hemorrhagic strokes and gastrointestinal bleeding secondary to aspirin use. One reviewer read and extracted data from each included article and constructed evidence tables. A second reviewer checked the accuracy of the data extraction. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus. Meta-analysis was performed, and the quantitative results of the review were then used to model the consequences of treating patients with different levels of baseline risk for coronary heart disease. Five trials examined the effect of aspirin on cardiovascular events in patients with no previous cardiovascular disease. For patients similar to those enrolled in the trials, aspirin reduces the risk for the combined end point of nonfatal myocardial infarction and fatal coronary heart disease (summary odds ratio, 0.72 [95% CI, 0.60 to 0.87]). Aspirin increased the risk for hemorrhagic strokes (summary odds ratio, 1.4 [CI, 0.9 to 2.0]) and major gastrointestinal bleeding (summary odds ratio, 1.7 [CI, 1.4 to 2.1]). All-cause mortality (summary odds ratio, 0.93 [CI, 0.84 to 1.02]) was not significantly affected. For 1000 patients with a 5% risk for coronary heart disease events over 5 years, aspirin would prevent 6 to 20 myocardial infarctions but would cause 0 to 2 hemorrhagic strokes and 2 to 4 major gastrointestinal bleeding events. For patients with a risk of 1% over 5 years, aspirin would prevent 1 to 4 myocardial infarctions but would cause 0 to 2 hemorrhagic strokes and 2 to 4 major gastrointestinal bleeding events. The net benefit of aspirin increases with increasing cardiovascular risk. In the decision to use aspirin chemoprevention, the patient's cardiovascular risk and relative utility for the different clinical outcomes prevented or caused by aspirin use must be considered.","A meta-analysis of 5 placebo-controlled randomized controlled trials involving more than 50,000 patients free of coronary heart disease and stroke evaluated aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease. Since 3 of the trials excluded women, only 20% of the participants were female. The mean age of participants was 57 years. The treatment groups took aspirin 75 to 500 mg/d for 3 to 7 years. The meta-analysis found that compared with placebo, aspirin significantly reduced total coronary heart disease events (odds ratio [OR]=0.72; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.60-0.87). Aspirin did not reduce coronary disease mortality (OR=0.87; 95% CI, 0.70-1.09);."
"Is nedocromil effective in preventing asthmatic attacks in patients with asthma
Some patients with asthma respond poorly to corticosteroids and have persistent airway inflammation and daily clinical symptoms. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of nedocromil sodium (NS), a nonsteroidal antinflamatory drug, in the treatment of steroid-resistant asthma. Steroid-resistant asthma as diagnosed in any patient who demonstrated 20% improvement in FEV1 after treatment with inhaled salbutamol with failure of FEV1 to improve by at least 15% after a 2-week trial of prednisolone, 30 mg daily. In a double-blind placebo-controlled trial, the patients received either 4 mg of inhaled NS (n = 13) or placebo (n = 13), 4 times daily for 3 months. NS but not placebo resulted in a mean increase in FEV1 of 11.4% after 12 weeks of therapy (p = 0.05) and of 12.4% (p = 0.04) and 15% (0.02) in morning peak expiratory flow after 8 and 12 weeks of treatment, respectively. Changes in FEV1 at 4 and 8 weeks and in peak expiratory flow at 4 weeks of NS therapy were not significant. NS was also effective in reducing variability of peak expiratory flow (p = 0.02) and use of salbutamol (p = 0.005) and in improving quality of life (p = 0.007) by the trial end. Six of the 12 patients treated with NS who completed the treatment period showed a ""good response,"" defined by a reduction in salbutamol use of more than 50% and an increase in morning peak expiratory flow of more than 20% from baseline; there were no clinical predictors of this response. Two patients were withdrawn from the study because of severe asthma exacerbation (one from each treatment group). Inhaled NS improved pulmonary function and decreased asthma severity in steroid-resistant asthma, but its effectiveness is not homogeneous and cannot be predicted from baseline clinical data.","A small study of patient considered to be steroid-resistant found nonsignificant trends towards reductions in bronchodilator use, increased PEFR, increased FEV1, and improved quality of life."
"What causes a low thyroid-stimulating hormone level with a normal free T4 level
Increasing use of assays for TSH with improved sensitivity as a first-line test of thyroid function has raised questions regarding prevalence and clinical significance of abnormal results, especially values below normal. We have assessed the thyroid status of 1210 patients aged over 60 registered with a single general practice by measurement of serum TSH using a sensitive assay. High TSH values were more common in females (11.6%) than males (2.9%). TSH values below normal were present in 6.3% of females and 5.5% of males, with values below the limit of detection of the assay present in 1.5% of females and 1.4% of males. Anti-thyroid antibodies were found in 60% of those with high TSH but only 5.6% of those with subnormal TSH. Eighteen patients were hypothyroid (high TSH, low free thyroxine) and one thyrotoxic (low TSH, raised free thyroxine) at initial testing. Seventy-three patients with elevated TSH but normal free T4 were followed for 12 months; 13 (17.8%) developed low free T4 levels and commenced thyroxine, TSH returned to normal in four (5.5%) and 56 (76.7%) continued to have high TSH values. Sixty-six patients with TSH results below normal were followed. Of the 50 subjects with low but detectable TSH at initial testing, 38 (76%) returned to normal at 12 months; of those 16 with undetectable TSH followed, 14 (87.5%) remained low at 12 months. Only one subject (who had an undetectable TSH) developed thyrotoxicosis. In view of the marked prevalence of thyroid dysfunction in the elderly, we suggest that screening of all patients over 60 should be considered.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","When followed up at 1 year, 40% to 60% of subjects with suppressed thyroid-stimulating hormone levels will have normal thyroid-stimulating hormone values."
"Is training patients in self-examination an effective way to screen for melanoma
We investigated the relationship between patient knowledge, awareness, and delay in seeking medical attention for melanoma. The study population was comprised of 255 cases with cutaneous melanoma newly diagnosed during January 15, 1987 to May 15, 1989, who were part of a population-based case control study. Personal interviews were conducted to obtain information on patient's knowledge of melanoma signs and symptoms, skin awareness, delay in seeking medical attention, and related covariates. The adjusted odds ratio for the association between skin awareness and delay was 0.30 (95% confidence interval 0.12-0.71). Odds ratios ranged from 0.43 to 0.81 for knowledge and delay. Awareness of skin changes was associated with a reduced Breslow depth for stage I melanomas. Individuals who are aware of skin changes and abnormalities appear to be less likely to delay seeking medical attention for melanoma. Knowledge of melanoma signs and symptoms may also contribute to a decreased delay in melanoma diagnosis.","In a study, involving a cohort of 255 patients from the first study who discovered their own melanomas, researchers questioned patients about their knowledge of melanoma signs and symptoms, awareness of the appearance of their own skin, and whether they delayed seeking medical attention for >3 months after detecting the initial lesion. More knowledgeable patients were less likely to have a thick (≥0.75 mm) tumor and a delayed diagnosis (OR=0.34; 95% CI, 0.13-0.88). Similarly, patients with greater awareness of their skin were less likely to have a thick tumor and a delayed diagnosis (OR=0.50; 95% CI, 0.28-0.89 and OR=0.30; 95% CI, 0.12-0.71, respectively). Investigators found no significant difference in mortality based on knowledge or skin awareness."
"Is DEET safe for children
Reducing the risk of mosquito bites is currently the only way to reduce the risk of West Nile virus infection. Methods for avoiding mosquito bites include limiting the time spent outdoors at dawn and dusk, wearing protective clothing and using an insect repellent. Repellents containing DEET (N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide, also known as N,N-diethyl-3-methylbenzamide) are the most effective and most widely used. However, concerns have been raised over the risk of adverse toxic effects, especially in young children and pregnant and lactating women. In this article, we review the available evidence on the effectiveness and safety of DEET-based products. The evidence does not support increased risk in young children.",A review found that DEET posed essentially no risk in children.
"When should a child with an undescended testis be referred to a urologist
Of the 10,730 neonates born in the period 1978-1997 and examined for cryptorchidism (C) at birth, 1387 were pre-term (gestational age <37 wk), and 9343 were full-term. At birth, a total of 737 neonates (6.9%) were cryptorchid, 487 had bilateral C and 250 unilateral C. The C rate of pre-terms was 10 times higher than that of the full-terms (30.1 and 3.4%, respectively). Comparing the two studied decades, a significant decrease of C rate was found in the second decade in full-term neonates. The rates of C at birth were significantly elevated for low birth weight, babies born from mothers with an age <20 or >35 yr, newborns from mothers with A Rh positive and B Rh positive blood group. Of the 737 cryptorchid newborns at birth, 613 (83%) were re-examined after 12 months from the expected date of delivery, and those born in the period 1988-1997 were also re-evaluated at 6 months of life. Late spontaneous descent occurred in 464 cases (75.7%), while 149 (24.3%) were still cryptorchid. The incidence of C at 12 months from the expected date of delivery, after survival curve calculation, in term and pre-term infants, was 1.53 and 7.31%, respectively, in the period 1978-1987, and 1.22 and 3.13% respectively, in the 2nd decade (1988-1997). In the groups also examined at 6 months of life, spontaneous descent occurred almost completely within the first 6 months of life in term infants, but not in pre-terms. No evidence of seasonal cyclicity was found. Medical and/or surgical treatment was generally started within 2-4 yr of age earlier in the second decade of the study. In conclusion, the main risk factor for C at birth and at 12 months of life seems to be pre-term birth and low birth weight. If this is associated itself to a higher risk of infertility too, it remains to be defined.","One study of 10,730 consecutive male term infants found cryptorchidism at birth in 2.7%, dropping to 1.22% by 6 months of age, but without further change at 1 year."
"How can we best treat and monitor venous thromboembolism during pregnancy
Low-molecular-weight (LMW) heparins have been shown to be at least as effective as unfractionated (UF) heparin in the treatment of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in nonpregnant subjects. LMW heparins have been shown to be safe when used during pregnancy as they do not cross the placenta. Up to now, they have been used mainly in thromboprophylaxis during pregnancy and rarely in the treatment of acute DVT in pregnant women. In a prospective observational study, we compared the effectiveness and safety of the LMW heparin, dalteparin, with UF heparin in the initial treatment (first week) of DVT during pregnancy. After confirmation of DVT by ultrasonography, 10 women were treated with UF heparin (25,430 IU/day, mean) and 21 women with dalteparin (16,000 IU/day, mean) for 7 days and, thereafter, all women were given treatment doses of LMW heparin for another 2 weeks. The dose was then gradually decreased and kept at a high prophylactic dose until delivery. One patient in the dalteparin group had recurrence of DVT 2 weeks after starting the treatment. No differences were observed between the groups in symptoms or bleeding complications during pregnancy and delivery. Our results indicate that LMW heparin is as effective and safe as UF heparin for the first week of treatment, but LMW heparin has the advantage of being easily administered and few laboratory controls are required.","For the initial week of treatment, the unfractionated heparin group received an IV bolus followed by infusion titrated to aPTT levels (goal 70-100s), while lowmolecular-weight heparin group received subcutaneous dalteparin 115 IU/kg twice daily adjusted to target antifactor Xa levels of 1 to 1.5 IU/mL 3 hours after injection. After 7 days, both groups received prophylactic doses of dalteparin throughout the remainder of pregnancy. There were no significant differences in outcome including bleeding or fetal effects. No cases of thrombocytopenia or pulmonary embolus were seen. There was 1 case of progressive thrombosis for a patient on low-molecular-weight heparin."
"Do steroid injections help with osteoarthritis of the knee
To assess the efficacy of a single intra-articular injection of triamcinolone hexacetonide (THA) in knee osteoarthritis (OA) and examine factors which may relate to treatment efficacy. Eighty four patients with clinical and radiographic evidence of knee OA were recruited and randomly allocated to receive either THA (20 mg in 1 ml) or placebo (0.9% normal saline, 1 ml). Follow up assessments evaluated the following outcome variables: patient opinion of overall change in the treated knee, visual analogue pain score (VAS), distance walked in one minute (WD), and Health Assessment Questionnaire modified for lower limb function (HAQ). Seventy eight percent of THA and 49% of placebo treated patients reported overall improvement at week 1 (p < 0.05). At week 6, improvement was reported in 57% and 55% of patient groups, respectively. VAS improved in both groups at week 1 (THA, p < 0.001; placebo, p < 0.05) and week 6 (both p < 0.01). Improvement in VAS was significantly greater among THA treated patients at week 1 only (p < 0.01). Subgroup analysis of THA treated patients revealed greater improvement in VAS among patients with clinical evidence of an effusion (p < 0.05), and those who had synovial fluid successfully aspirated at the time of injection (p < 0.01). WD improved in THA treated patients at week 1 (p < 0.001), and in both groups at week 6 (THA, p < 0.001; placebo, p < 0.01). Improvements in HAQ were seen in THA patients only at weeks 1 and 6 (p < 0.05). Regression analysis did not identify any additional clinical, radiographic, or synovial fluid characteristics which influenced the response. THA provided short term pain relief in knee OA. Increased benefit was associated with both clinical evidence of joint effusion and successful aspiration of synovial fluid at the time of injection.","A randomized, single-blinded study involving 84 patients demonstrated significant self-report-ed ""overall improvement"" for patients given intra-articular triamcinolone hexacetonide (78%) compared with placebo (49%) after 1 week (P<.05). It also confirmed reports that visual analogue score for pain and distance walked in 1 minute improves significantly for both steroid- and placebo-treated groups up to 6 weeks. Only the steroid-treated patients exhibited improved walking distance at 1 week compared with baseline (P<.001)."
"Does psychiatric treatment help patients with intractable chronic pain
Three previous reviews have reached conflicting conclusions regarding the efficacy of antidepressants for patients with back pain. To systematically review the efficacy of antidepressants for the treatment of patients with back pain and to determine whether there is evidence that outcomes vary between classes of antidepressants. Best evidence synthesis of randomized, placebo-controlled trials of oral antidepressive agents in patients with back pain. Studies were identified by searching MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Registry. Two independent reviewers performed data extraction and assessed included studies with a 22-point methodologic quality assessment scale. Effect sizes were calculated if sufficient data were available. Twenty-two trials of antidepressants for the treatment of back pain were identified, of which seven studies of chronic low back pain met inclusion criteria. Among studies using antidepressants that inhibit norepinephrine reuptake (tricyclic or tetracyclic antidepressants), four of five found significant improvement in at least one relevant outcome measure. Assessment of these agents' impact on functional measures produced mixed results. No benefit in pain relief or functional status was found in three studies of antidepressants that do not inhibit norepinephrine reuptake. Based on a small number of studies, tricyclic and tetracyclic antidepressants appear to produce moderate symptom reductions for patients with chronic low back pain. This benefit appears to be independent of depression status. SSRIs do not appear to be beneficial for patients with chronic low back pain. There is conflicting evidence whether antidepressants improve functional status of patients with chronic low back pain.",It appears that those with only SSRI activity are not effective improving chronic pain.
"Which infants need lumbar puncture for suspected sepsis
Prospective studies were conducted to test the hypothesis that infants unlikely to have serious bacterial infections (SBI) can be accurately identified by low risk criteria. Febrile infants (rectal T > or = 38 degrees C) < or = 60 days of age were considered at low risk for SBI if they met the following criteria: 1) appear well; 2) were previously healthy; 3) have no focal infection; 4) have WBC count 5.0-15.0 x 10(9) cells/L (5000-15,000/mm3), band form count < or = 1.5 x 10(9) cells/L (< or = 1500/mm3), < or = 10 WBC per high power field on microscopic examination of spun urine sediment, and < or = 5 WBC per high power field on microscopic examination of a stool smear (if diarrhea). The recommended evaluation included the culture of specimens of blood, cerebrospinal fluid, and urine for bacteria. Outcomes were determined. The negative predictive values of the low risk criteria for SBI and bacteremia were calculated. Of 1057 eligible infants, 931 were well appearing, and, of these, 437 met the remaining low risk criteria. Five low risk infants had SBI including two infants with bacteremia. The negative predictive value of the low risk criteria was 98.9% (95% confidence interval, 97.2% to 99.6%) for SBI, and 99.5% (95% confidence interval, 98.2% to 99.9%) for bacteremia. These data confirm the ability of the low risk criteria to identify infants unlikely to have SBI. Infants who meet the low risk criteria can be carefully observed without administering antimicrobial agents.","The ""low-risk"" infants have a correspondingly lower incidence of serious bacterial infection: the negative predictive value of the Rochester classification is 98.9% 95% confidence interval [CI], 97.2-99.6%."
"What is the best way to treat tinea cruris
Superficial dermatophytoses of skin are very common infections seen in clinical practice. Besides topical imidazoles, triazoles and allylamines, topical butenafine (a benzylamine derivative) is a novel agent with broad antifungal activity. One hundred and eleven patients with tinea infections were enrolled in this multicentric, randomised, single-blind non-comparative study, which involved application of butenafine (1%) cream in tinea pedis (4 weeks) and tinea cruris and tinea corporis (2 weeks) cases. The results showed that butenafine causes rapid resolution of signs and symptoms (erythema itching, burning, crusting, scaling, etc), with good patient and physician acceptability of treatment. The broader spectrum fungicidal activity and better drug retention in superficial skin layers may be responsible for this beneficial effect.","Butenafine (Mentax), a benzylamine antifungal, was 88% to 93% mycologically effective in a noncomparative study, when used twice daily for 2 weeks."
"Which blood tests are most helpful in evaluating pelvic inflammatory disease
--To examine the accuracy of existing diagnostic indicators for pelvic inflammatory disease and to develop guidelines for a new diagnostic model. --Studies were identified for the period 1969 through 1990. A Medline search of the English-language literature was conducted using the subject terms pelvic inflammatory disease or salpingitis and diagnosis. In addition, abstracts and bibliographies of articles and books were reviewed. --Studies were selected if pelvic inflammatory disease was diagnosed using laparoscopic findings or narrow clinical rules. Of the 15 reports identified, 12 were included in this analysis. The selected studies were grouped by a quality rating based on subject selection, definition of pelvic inflammatory disease, data analysis, and other measures. --Diagnostic findings were divided into four categories: historical (symptoms), clinical examination (signs), laboratory, and combinations of the above. Sensitivity and specificity were extracted using raw data. Data were classified by quality rating. --Historical findings were usually not statistically significant predictors of pelvic inflammatory disease, and when they were they tended toward low sensitivity and high specificity, while clinical findings were somewhat more sensitive and about as specific. Several laboratory tests showed consistent value in pelvic inflammatory disease diagnosis, with high sensitivity and specificity. Combinations of indicators permitted high sensitivity or high specificity but not both simultaneously. --No single or combination diagnostic indicator was found to reliably predict pelvic inflammatory disease. Combining published evidence with practical clinical considerations, a diagnostic approach is proposed that emphasizes diagnostic sensitivity when clinical presentation is mild and more thorough evaluation when a woman is severely ill. Research is needed to evaluate the accuracy and acceptability of specific diagnostic models and to investigate new diagnostic indicators.","A meta-analysis from 1991 found 12 studies, not including any of the above studies, and assessed the laboratory criteria for the diagnosis of PID. No single or combination diagnostic indicator was found to reliably predict PID. However, the c-reactive protein and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate were useful in ruling out PID, with good sensitivities for c-reactive protein in 4 of 4 studies analyzed (74%-93%) and for the erythrocyte sedimentation rate in 4 of 6 studies (64%-81%). Ten of 12 studies used laparoscopy as the gold standard."
"How accurate is the use of ECGs in the diagnosis of myocardial infarct
When faced with a patient with acute chest pain, clinicians must distinguish myocardial infarction (MI) from all other causes of acute chest pain. If MI is suspected, current therapeutic practice includes deciding whether to administer thrombolysis or primary percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and whether to admit patients to a coronary care unit. The former decision is based on electrocardiographic (ECG) changes, including ST-segment elevation or left bundle-branch block, the latter on the likelihood of the patient's having unstable high-risk ischemia or MI without ECG changes. Despite advances in investigative modalities, a focused history and physical examination followed by an ECG remain the key tools for the diagnosis of MI. The most powerful features that increase the probability of MI, and their associated likelihood ratios (LRs), are new ST-segment elevation (LR range, 5.7-53.9); new Q wave (LR range, 5.3-24.8); chest pain radiating to both the left and right arm simultaneously (LR, 7.1); presence of a third heart sound (LR, 3.2); and hypotension (LR, 3.1). The most powerful features that decrease the probability of MI are a normal ECG result (LR range, 0.1-0.3), pleuritic chest pain (LR, 0.2), chest pain reproduced by palpation (LR range, 0.2-0.4), sharp or stabbing chest pain (LR, 0.3), and positional chest pain (LR, 0.3). Computer-derived algorithms that depend on clinical examination and ECG findings might improve the classification of patients according to the probability that an MI is causing their chest pain.","New ST segment elevation is the most important electrocardiogram feature in increasing the probability of diagnosing an MI, with LRs ranging from 5.7 to 53.9."
"Does glucosamine relieve arthritis joint pain
There are a sufficient number of short-term studies with these agents suggesting efficacy equal to that seen in the symptomatic treatment of OA using NSAIDs. Two recent meta-analyses by McAlindon and colleagues and Towheed et al reviewed clinical trials of glucosamine and chondroitin in the treatment of osteoarthritis. The study by McAlindon and co-workers included all double-blind placebo-controlled trials of greater than 4 weeks' duration, testing oral or parenteral glucosamine or chondroitin for treatment of hip or knee osteoarthritis. Thirteen trials (six with glucosamine, seven with chondroitin) met eligibility criteria. The authors used global pain score or the Lequesne index in the index joint as the primary outcome measure and considered the trial positive if improvement in the treatment group was equal to or greater than 25% compared with the placebo group, and was significant (P < or = .05). All 13 studies reviewed were classified as positive, demonstrating large effects, compared with placebo (39.5% [S.D. 21.9] for glucosamine, 40.2% [S.D. 6.4] for chondroitin). The authors concluded that clinical trials of these two agents showed substantial benefit in the treatment of osteoarthritis but provided insufficient information about study design and conduct to allow definitive evaluation. Towheed and colleagues reviewed nine randomized, controlled trials of glucosamine sulfate in osteoarthritis. In seven of the randomized controlled trials, in which they compared glucosamine with placebo, glucosamine was always superior. In two randomized controlled trials comparing glucosamine to ibuprofen, glucosamine was superior in one and equivalent in one. Methodologic problems, including lack of standardized case definition of osteoarthritis and lack of standardized outcome assessment led the authors to conclude that further studies are needed to determine if route of administration is important and whether the therapeutic effect is site specific. A meta-analysis of chondroitin sulfate trials has also been published. Of the 12 published trials, 4 randomized double-blind placebo or NSAID-controlled trials with 227 patients on chondroitin sulfate were entered into the analysis. All four studies showed chondroitin sulfate to be superior to placebo, with respect to Lequesne index, visual analog scale for pain and medication consumption. Significant changes (P < or = .05) were seen in those treated from day 60 to the study endpoints (150 to 180 days). Pooled data demonstrated at least 50% improvement in the study variables in the chondroitin treated group. Discrepancies in some of the study findings reported in the literature may relate to the composition of the nutritional supplements used. Studies in the United States have revealed that a number of preparations claiming to contain certain doses of glucosamine or chondroitin sulfate have significantly less (or none) of the dosages described. Accordingly, it is essential that studies performed with these agents use preparations that are carefully defined in manufacture. The amounts generally administered are glucosamine, 1500 mg, and chondroitin sulfate, 1200 mg, daily. Although glucosamine has been described as effective when used alone, it is probably reasonable to use the combination pending further studies. The average cost is approximately $30 to $45 per month. In the interim, what should physicians tell their patients when they ask whether these agents are effective, or whether they should or should not take them? The authors emphasize that these agents are not FDA-evaluated or recommended for the treatment of OA. They are available as health food supplements, and the number of studies of toxicity, particularly with respect to long-term evaluations, is limited. The pros and cons of these agents and the published data are described so that patients can make a reasonably informed decision as to whether they wish to proceed with use of these agents in therapy. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)","Identified flaws in the studies include small sample size, inconsistent diagnostic criteria, variable disease sites, differing routes of administration, inconsistent doses, compositions and forms of glucosamine, the brief durations of studies, and poorly defined endpoints."
"What is the best way to treat tinea cruris
To evaluate the possible role of honey, olive oil and beeswax in the treatment of skin fungal infections. Thirty-seven patients with pityriasis versicolor, tinea cruris, tinea corporis and tinea faciei were studied. After clinical evaluation of redness, scaling, pruritus and burning/pain sensation and mycological assessment, honey mixture containing honey, olive oil and beeswax (1:1:1) was applied to the lesions three times daily for a maximum of 4 weeks. Clinical response was obtained in 86% of patients with pityriasis versicolor, 78% of patients with tinea cruris and in 75% of patients with tinea corporis. Mycological cure was obtained in 75, 71 and 62% of patients with PV, tinea cruris and tinea corporis, respectively. The patient with tinea faciei showed clinical and mycological cure 3 weeks after commencement of therapy. Honey mixture may have place in the management of these skin conditions and rigorous, controlled trials are justified.","An open-pilot study of 14 patients with tinea cruris demonstrated 71% mycological cure with a honey, olive oil, and beeswax (1:1:1) mixture, applied 3 times daily up to 3 weeks, likely due to honey's inhibitory effect on fungus and beeswax's anti-inflammatory properties."
"Are liver function tests required for patients taking isoniazid for latent tuberculosis
To describe the clinical and demographic characteristics of fatal hepatitis due to single-drug isoniazid preventive therapy for tuberculosis, we did a survey of cases from state health departments, published case reports, and reports to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from 1970 to 1992. Of 108 reported cases, some clinical information was available for 76. A medical review panel judged 39 of these deaths as probably due to isoniazid hepatitis and 23 deaths as possibly due to isoniazid hepatitis. Of the 62 probable and possible cases combined, 50 (81%) were female, 49 (79%) were non-Hispanic black or Hispanic, and 19 (31%) were younger than 35 years. The median duration of isoniazid preventive therapy before symptom onset was 16 weeks. Of the 60 cases with symptom information, 54 (90%) presented with jaundice. Of the 62 cases, 26 (42%) were monitored monthly in accordance with current recommendations, and 6 of the patients were younger than 35 years. We estimate that the rate of fatal isoniazid hepatitis among patients in the public sector was no greater than 4.2 per 100,000 persons beginning therapy and no greater than 7 per 100,000 persons completing therapy. Adherence to isoniazid preventive therapy guidelines apparently reduces, but does not eliminate, the risk of fatal hepatitis. Careful patient selection, education, and monitoring are critical for minimizing that risk.","Symptom-based monitoring strategies require stopping isoniazid promptly if symptoms of hepatotoxicity develop. In a series of 62 fatal cases of probable or possible isoniazid hepatitis, 42% had been monitored at least monthly for symptoms, and 38% stopped isoniazid within 1 week of symptom onset."
"Should patients receive 23-valent pneumococcal vaccination more than once
To learn whether the risk of revaccination in adults should limit its use, the authors investigated whether adverse events requiring hospitalization occurred in a group of Medicare enrollees revaccinated with pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine. A prospective cohort analysis and case study of revaccinated people involved five percent of all elderly Medicare enrollees from 1985 through 1988, consisting of 66,256 people receiving one dose of vaccine and 1,099 receiving two doses. Comparison was made of the hospitalization rate within 30 days after revaccination and rates of singly vaccinated persons using discharge diagnosis for all those hospitalized during the 30 days after revaccination. No significant difference was found between the hospitalization rate of the revaccinated cohort and comparison group. No adverse reactions attributable to pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine causing hospitalization were identified among 39 revaccinated persons who were hospitalized within 30 days of revaccination. Revaccination of elderly Medicare beneficiaries does not cause events serious enough to require hospitalization. Vaccination of persons according to the Public Health Service Immunization Practice Advisory Committee guidelines is recommended when the prior immunization status is unknown.","Revaccination, however, does not result in increased rates of hospitalization, and few severe reactions have been reported."
"What best prevents exerciseinduced bronchoconstriction for a child with asthma
Accumulating evidence shows that cysteinyl leukotrienes are the most important mediators in exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB). In contrast to several studies in adults, there are few long-term studies of leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs) in children with EIB. The aim of this study was to assess the prolonged clinical and bronchoprotective effects of montelukast in asthmatic children with EIB. We randomly assigned 64 asthmatic children with EIB. Forty subjects received montelukast (5 mg/day), and 24 subjects received placebo once daily for 8 weeks. Exercise challenge was performed before and after 8 weeks of treatment. Of the 40 patients in the montelukast group, 28 patients crossed over after 8 weeks. The response was measured as asthma symptom score, maximum percent fall in forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV(1)) from pre-exercise baseline, and time to recovery of FEV(1) to within 10% of pre-exercise baseline (time to recovery). Following 8 weeks of treatment with montelukast, the montelukast group compared with placebo showed significant improvements in all endpoints, including asthma symptom score, maximum percent fall in FEV(1) after exercise, and time to recovery. In the cross-over group, even 8 weeks after stopping montelukast treatment, all endpoints were significantly and persistently improved. These results indicate that montelukast provides clinical protection from airway hyperresponsiveness in asthmatic children with EIB, and suggest that LTRAs may be useful for the long-term management of asthmatic children with EIB.","A recent study assessed the effects of montelukast (Singulair) on 64 children with exercise-induced bronchoconstriction. After 8 weeks of treatment, the montelukast group showed significant improvements (compared with placebo) in asthma symptom scores (24.3±8.2 before vs 17.8±6.8 after 8 weeks of montelukast treatment, P<.05; vs 17.7±6.7 8 weeks after stopping treatment, P<.05), maximum percent fall in FEV1 after exercise (36.5±10.2% before vs 27.6±14.4% after 8 wks of treatment, P<.01; vs 26.7±19.4% 8 weeks after stopping treatment, P<.01), and time to recovery (41.8±8.1 min before vs 25.3±23.3 min after 8 weeks of treatment, P<.01; vs 27.7±26.5 min 8 weeks after stopping, P<.05)."
"Does bed rest for preeclampsia improve neonatal outcomes
Bed rest or restriction of activity, with or without hospitalisation, have been advocated for women with hypertension during pregnancy to improve pregnancy outcome. However, benefits need to be demonstrated before such interventions can be recommended since restricted activity may be disruptive to women's lives, expensive, and increase the risk of thromboembolism. To assess the effects on the mother and the baby of different degrees of bed rest, compared with each other, and with routine activity, in hospital or at home, for primary treatment of hypertension during pregnancy. We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (April 2005), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library, Issue 1, 2005), and EMBASE (January 2002 to December 2004). Randomised trials evaluating bed rest for women with hypertension in pregnancy were selected. Two review authors assessed trials for inclusion independently, and extracted data. Data were entered into RevMan software and double-checked. Four small trials (449 women) were included. Three were of good quality. Two trials (145 women) compared strict bed rest with some rest, in hospital, for women with proteinuric hypertension. There was insufficient evidence to demonstrate any differences between the groups for reported outcomes. Two trials (304 women) compared some bed rest in hospital with routine activity at home for non-proteinuric hypertension. There was reduced risk of severe hypertension (1 trial, 218 women; RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.89) and a borderline reduction in risk of preterm birth (1 trial, 218 women; RR 0.53, CI 0.29 to 0.99) with some rest compared to normal activity. More women in the bed rest group opted not to have the same management in future pregnancies, if the choice were given (1 trial, 86 women; RR 3.00, 95% CI 1.43 to 6.31). There were no significant differences for any other outcomes. Few randomised trials have evaluated rest for women with hypertension during pregnancy, and important information on side-effects and cost implication is missing from available trials. Although one small trial suggests that some bed rest may be associated with reduced risk of severe hypertension and preterm birth, these findings need to be confirmed in larger trials. At present, there is insufficient evidence to provide clear guidance for clinical practice. Therefore, bed rest should not be recommended routinely for hypertension in pregnancy, especially since more women appear to prefer unrestricted activity, if the choice were given.","A single-center randomized controlled trials investigated bed rest treatment for 105 patients with preeclampsia and gestational ages between 26 to 38 weeks. Patients were assigned to either strict bed rest with bathroom privileges in the hospital until delivery, or to bed rest with the ability to move freely around the hospital. Outcome assessors were not blinded to patient treatment allocation. There was no statistical difference between the 2 groups in perinatal or neonatal mortality, or in the neonatal morbidities of preterm births, endotracheal intubations, or neonatal intensive care unit admissions."
"Should you test or treat partners of patients with gonorrhea, chlamydia, or trichomoniasis
Repeated infection with C trachomatis increases the risk for serious sequelae: pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy, infertility, and chronic pelvic pain. A substantial proportion of women treated for C trachomatis infection are reinfected by an untreated male sex partner in the first several months after treatment. Effective strategies to ensure partner treatment are needed. The goal of the study was to determine whether repeated infections with C trachomatis can be reduced by giving women doses of azithromycin to deliver to male sex partners. A multicenter randomized controlled trial was conducted among 1,787 women aged 14 to 34 years with uncomplicated C trachomatis genital infection diagnosed at family planning, adolescent, sexually transmitted disease, and primary care clinics or emergency or other hospital departments in five US cities. Women treated for infection were randomized to one of two groups: patient-delivered partner treatment (in which they were given a dose of azithromycin to deliver to each sex partner) or self-referral (in which they were asked to refer their sex partners for treatment). The main outcome measure was C trachomatis DNA detected by urine ligase chain reaction (LCR) or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) by 4 months after treatment. The characteristics of study participants enrolled in each arm were similar except for a small difference in the age distribution. Risk of reinfection was 20% lower among women in the patient-delivered partner treatment arm (87/728; 12%) than among those in the self-referral arm (106/726; 15%); however, this difference was not statistically significant (odds ratio, 0.80; 95% confidence interval, 0.62-1.05; = 0.102). Women in the patient-delivered partner treatment arm reported high compliance with the intervention (82%). Patient-delivered partner treatment for prevention of repeated infection among women is comparable to self-referral and may be an appropriate option for some patients.","One randomized controlled trials showed a statistically significant reduction in recurrent or persistent urethritis, but did not report persistent and recurrent gonorrheal and chlamydial infections separately. The randomized controlled trials showed a statistically significant decrease in recurrent or persistent urethritis, but without identifying recurrent gonorrheal and chlamydial infections separately."
"What is the initial work-up in the diagnosis of hypertension
Microalbuminuria is a risk factor for cardiovascular (CV) events. The relationship between the degree of albuminuria and CV risk is unclear. To estimate the risk of CV events in high-risk individuals with diabetes mellitus (DM) and without DM who have microalbuminuria and to determine whether levels of albuminuria below the microalbuminuria threshold increase CV risk. The Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation study, a cohort study conducted between 1994 and 1999 with a median 4.5 years of follow-up. Community and academic practices in North and South America and Europe. Individuals aged 55 years or more with a history of CV disease (n = 5545) or DM and at least 1 CV risk factor (n = 3498) and a baseline urine albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR) measurement. Cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, stroke, or CV death); all-cause death; and hospitalization for congestive heart failure. Microalbuminuria was detected in 1140 (32.6%) of those with DM and 823 (14.8%) of those without DM at baseline. Microalbuminuria increased the adjusted relative risk (RR) of major CV events (RR, 1.83; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.64-2.05), all-cause death (RR, 2.09; 95% CI, 1.84-2.38), and hospitalization for congestive heart failure (RR, 3.23; 95% CI, 2.54-4.10). Similar RRs were seen for participants with or without DM, even after adjusting for other CV risk factors (eg, the adjusted RR of the primary aggregate end point was 1.97 [95% CI, 1.68-2.31] in those with DM and 1.61 [95% CI, 1.36-1.90] in those without DM). Compared with the lowest quartile of ACR (<0.22 mg/mmol), the RRs of the primary aggregate end point in the second quartile (ie, ACR range, 0.22-0.57 mg/mmol) was 1.11 (95% CI, 0.95-1.30); third quartile, 1.38 (95% CI, 1.19-1.60; ACR range, 0.58-1.62 mg/mmol); and fourth quartile, 1.97 (95% CI, 1.73-2.25; ACR range, >1.62 mg/mmol) (P for trend <.001, even after excluding those with microalbuminuria). For every 0.4-mg/mmol increase in ACR level, the adjusted hazard of major CV events increased by 5.9% (95% CI, 4.9%-7.0%). Our results indicate that any degree of albuminuria is a risk factor for CV events in individuals with or without DM; the risk increases with the ACR, starting well below the microalbuminuria cutoff. Screening for albuminuria identifies people at high risk for CV events.",All panels listed microalbuminuria testing as an optional study for patients without diabetes because of its association with an increased incidence of cerebrovascular disease.
"Which tests are the most useful for diagnosing pelvic inflammatory disease
--To examine the accuracy of existing diagnostic indicators for pelvic inflammatory disease and to develop guidelines for a new diagnostic model. --Studies were identified for the period 1969 through 1990. A Medline search of the English-language literature was conducted using the subject terms pelvic inflammatory disease or salpingitis and diagnosis. In addition, abstracts and bibliographies of articles and books were reviewed. --Studies were selected if pelvic inflammatory disease was diagnosed using laparoscopic findings or narrow clinical rules. Of the 15 reports identified, 12 were included in this analysis. The selected studies were grouped by a quality rating based on subject selection, definition of pelvic inflammatory disease, data analysis, and other measures. --Diagnostic findings were divided into four categories: historical (symptoms), clinical examination (signs), laboratory, and combinations of the above. Sensitivity and specificity were extracted using raw data. Data were classified by quality rating. --Historical findings were usually not statistically significant predictors of pelvic inflammatory disease, and when they were they tended toward low sensitivity and high specificity, while clinical findings were somewhat more sensitive and about as specific. Several laboratory tests showed consistent value in pelvic inflammatory disease diagnosis, with high sensitivity and specificity. Combinations of indicators permitted high sensitivity or high specificity but not both simultaneously. --No single or combination diagnostic indicator was found to reliably predict pelvic inflammatory disease. Combining published evidence with practical clinical considerations, a diagnostic approach is proposed that emphasizes diagnostic sensitivity when clinical presentation is mild and more thorough evaluation when a woman is severely ill. Research is needed to evaluate the accuracy and acceptability of specific diagnostic models and to investigate new diagnostic indicators.","One systematic review of 12 fair- to good-quality studies, based in Europe and the US, included urban populations treated in Ob/Gyn departments, emergency rooms, and sexually transmitted disease clinics. This review supports a thorough evaluation when more severe disease is suspected and the use of sensitive diagnostic tests for suspected mild disease-eg, c-reactive protein (74%-93% sensitivity) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (64%-81% sensitivity for value >20 or 15 mm/h)."
"How much does smoking cessation cut coronary heart disease risk
The goal of this study was to ascertain how continued cigarette smoking or smoking cessation related to long-term survival and morbidity in patients with established coronary artery disease managed with medical therapy or coronary bypass surgery. Although the association of cigarette smoking with coronary artery disease is well established, the morbidity and mortality associated with smoking behavior in patients with such disease receiving medical or surgical therapy are less well established. The 780 patients randomized to medical therapy or coronary bypass surgery in the Coronary Artery Surgery Study (CASS) were subgrouped according to smoking behavior during a mean 11.2-year follow-up interval. Comparisons between smokers and nonsmokers were accomplished by univariate and Cox time-dependent multivariate analyses. Survival at 10 years after entry into the study was 82% among 468 patients who reported no smoking during follow-up (nonsmokers) compared with 77% among the 312 smokers (p = 0.025). Survival was 80% among those who smoked at entry but stopped (quitters) versus 69% among those who continued smoking (p = 0.025). For patients who smoked at baseline and were randomized to bypass surgery, survival at 10 years was 84% among quitters and 68% among nonquitters (p = 0.018); the difference in survival between quitters (75%) and nonquitters (71%) was less among those randomized to medical therapy (p = NS). Among those who smoked at baseline, continued smoking increased the relative risk of death by 1.73. After 10 years, smokers, in comparison with nonsmokers, were less likely to be angina free and more likely to be unemployed and had more activity limitation and more hospital admissions (primarily for chest pain, heart attack, cardiac catheterization, peripheral vascular surgery and stroke). Thus, among patients with documented coronary artery disease, continued cigarette smoking may result in decreased survival--especially among those undergoing bypass surgery. Moreover, smokers have more angina, more unemployment, a greater limitation of physical activity and more hospital admissions.","Long-term quit status in post-coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery patients has been found to predict decreased morbidity and lower rates of repeat revascularization surgery. Findings from the Coronary Artery Surgery Study show that, at 10-year follow-up, nonsmokers were more likely to be free of angina (54% of nonsmokers vs 42% of smokers; P=.02, NNT=8.3) and less likely to experience moderate to severe physical limitations (13% of non-smokers vs 24% of smokers; P=.0004; NNT=9.1). Nonsmokers also had fewer CHD-related admissions than smokers (2.6 vs 3.8; P<.0001)."
"What evaluation is best for an isolated, enlarged cervical lymph node
Fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) is widely used for the assessment of various lesions. The results of FNABs of lymph nodes on 1,103 patients, performed over a 14-year period, from 1978 to 1992, are presented. The patients ranged in age from 1 to 90 years. Cervical nodes were the site sampled most frequently (47%). Of all the aspirates, 593 were diagnosed cytologically as malignant, 61 as suspicious for malignancy and 329 as benign. The material was classified as unsatisfactory in 120 cases. Aspirates from supraclavicular nodes were most likely to be malignant (85%), followed by those from deep nodes (67%). The most challenging lesions to assess using FNAB were lymphomas, accounting for 15 of the 23 false negatives. Most of these were related to difficulty in the interpretation of well-differentiated neoplasms in the early years of this study, prior to the use of immunocytochemistry. Sampling errors accounted for eight false-negative diagnoses; they included all the cases of metastatic carcinomas that had been missed. There were only three false-positive diagnoses; two of these involved the misinterpretation of lipid-rich lesions as metastatic clear cell carcinomas. The results of this study support the accuracy of FNAB and its value in investigating lymphadenopathies. FNAB of nodes provides a high level of diagnostic accuracy, as shown by the 3.4% false-negative and 0.9% false-positive rates. Lymphoid marker studies of cytologic material greatly enhance our ability to diagnose and properly classify lymphomas and reduce the false-negative rate.","A study of 1103 patients found a 97% sensitivity (3.4% false-negative rate) and a 99% specificity (0.9% false-positive rate) for fine-needle aspiration.4 In cases where pathology is equivocal, or where concern for malignancy is exceptionally high, excisional biopsy provides a more definitive diagnosis."
"What treatment works best for tennis elbow
This review is one in a series of reviews of interventions for lateral elbow pain. To determine the effectiveness and safety of extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) for lateral elbow pain. Searches of the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2004), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Science Citation Index (SCISEARCH) were conducted in February 2005, unrestricted by date. We included nine trials that randomised 1006 participants to ESWT or placebo and one trial that randomised 93 participants to ESWT or steroid injection. For each trial two independent reviewers assessed the methodological quality and extracted data. Methodological quality criteria included appropriate randomisation, allocation concealment, blinding, number lost to follow up and intention to treat analysis. Where appropriate, pooled analyses were performed. If there was significant heterogeneity between studies or the data reported did not allow statistical pooling, individual trial results were described in the text. Eleven of the 13 pooled analyses found no significant benefit of ESWT over placebo. For example, the weighted mean difference for improvement in pain (on a 100-point scale) from baseline to 4-6 weeks from a pooled analysis of three trials (446 participants) was -9.42 (95% CI -20.70 to 1.86) and the weighted mean difference for improvement in pain (on a 100-point scale) provoked by resisted wrist extension (Thomsen test) from baseline to 12 weeks from a pooled analysis of three trials (455 participants) was -9.04 (95% CI -19.37 to 1.28). Two pooled results favoured ESWT. For example, the pooled relative risk of treatment success (at least 50% improvement in pain with resisted wrist extension at 12 weeks) for ESWT in comparison to placebo from a pooled analysis of two trials (192 participants) was 2.2 (95% CI 1.55 to 3.12). However this finding was not supported by the results of four other individual trials that were unable to be pooled. Steroid injection was more effective than ESWT at 3 months after the end of treatment assessed by a reduction of pain of 50% from baseline (21/25 (84%) versus 29/48 (60%), p<0.05). Minimal adverse effects of ESWT were reported. Most commonly these were transient pain, reddening of the skin and nausea and in most cases did not require treatment discontinuation or dosage adjustment. Based upon systematic review of nine placebo-controlled trials involving 1006 participants, there is ""Platinum"" level evidence that shock wave therapy provides little or no benefit in terms of pain and function in lateral elbow pain. There is ""Silver"" level evidence based upon one trial involving 93 participants that steroid injection may be more effective than ESWT.","In a meta-analysis of 3 trials, shock wave therapy provided no significant benefit at 4 to 6 weeks compared with placebo (WMD on a 100-point scale=-9.42; 95% CI, -20.70 to 1.86)."
"Does lowering diastolic blood pressure to less than 90 mm Hg decrease cardiovascular risk
To investigate whether the lower the blood pressure (BP) the better the prognosis for the patient with moderate-to-severe hypertension, an assessment was made of 902 patients who received the beta 1-selective beta-blocker atenolol (median dose 100 mg a day), either alone or with other antihypertensive agents, for up to 10 years (mean 6.1). 91 died, 40 from myocardial infarction, 21 from stroke, and 30 from other causes. Initial BP was a poor predictor of mortality from myocardial infarction, whereas treated systolic blood pressure (SBP) was a strong predictor. There was a J-shaped relation, confined to those with evidence of ischaemic heart disease, between frequency of death from myocardial infarction and treated DBP (phase V); the frequency was lowest at treated DBP of 85-90 mm Hg and rose with treated DBP on either side of this range.","There is concern that lowering diastolic blood pressure too much may actually increase cardiovascular risk. A 10-year observational study showed that in patients with a history of ischemic heart disease, the incidence of fatal myocardial infarction was lowest when diastolic blood pressure was between 85 to 90 mm Hg and increased with diastolic blood pressure <85 mm Hg, thus demonstrating a J-shaped curve."
"What treatments work best for constipation in children
The efficacy of two medications commonly used in treatment of chronic functional constipation of children (CFC) was compared. Thirty-seven children (aged 3-12 years) with typical CFC were assigned at random to treatment with mineral oil or standardized senna concentrate (Senokot). The results of follow-up evaluations at 1, 3, and greater than 6 months indicate that symptom control (fecal soiling and decreased stool frequency) was significantly better in mineral-oil-treated patients. At least one recurrence of symptoms occurred in 66% of mineral-oil-treated and 89% of Senokot-treated patients. However, recurrences appeared later and less frequently in mineral-oil-treated patients. After 6 months, 55% of those treated with mineral oil had successfully discontinued regular medication. After 6 months, only 22% of Senokot-treated patients had successfully discontinued medication, while an additional 33% had stopped taking medication because of poor symptom control.",A small randomized controlled trials found that mineral oil treated constipation more successfully than senna at 3 and 10 months of follow-up.
"Should we screen for ovarian cancer
The purpose of this Committee Opinion is to define the role of the generalist obstetrician-gynecologist in the early detection of ovarian cancer. Currently, it appears that the best way to detect early ovarian cancer is for both the patient and her clinician to have a high index of suspicion of the diagnosis in the symptomatic woman. In evaluating symptoms, physicians should perform a physical examination, including a pelvic examination. In premenopausal women with symptoms, a CA 125 measurement has not been shown to be useful in most circumstances. In postmenopausal women with a pelvic mass, a CA 125 measurement may be helpful in predicting a higher likelihood of a malignant tumor than a benign tumor, which may be useful in making consultation or referral decisions or both. A woman with a suspicious or persistent complex adnexal mass requires surgical evaluation by a physician trained to appropriately stage and debulk ovarian cancer. Data suggest that currently available screening tests do not appear to be beneficial for screening low-risk, asymptomatic women. An annual gynecologic examination with an annual pelvic examination is recommended for preventive health care.",american college of obstetricians and gynecologists recommends an annual pelvic examination for all women as part of routine preventive care.
"When should patients with asymptomatic aortic stenosis be evaluated for valve replacement
The prevalence of mitral regurgitation, valvular aortic stenosis, aortic regurgitation, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, and of left ventricular hypertrophy was not significantly different in older men and women. Older women had a significantly higher prevalence of rheumatic mitral stenosis, mitral annular calcium, and left atrial enlargement than older men, and older men had a significantly higher prevalence of abnormal left ventricular ejection fraction than older women.","One series of 1243 elderly women (mean age of 82) found mild stenosis in 10%, moderate stenosis in 6%, and severe stenosis in 2%."
"Are there any known health risks to early introduction of solids to an infant's diet
While gluten ingestion is responsible for the signs and symptoms of celiac disease, it is not known what factors are associated with initial appearance of the disease. To examine whether the timing of gluten exposure in the infant diet was associated with the development of celiac disease autoimmunity (CDA). Prospective observational study conducted in Denver, Colo, from 1994-2004 of 1560 children at increased risk for celiac disease or type 1 diabetes, as defined by possession of either HLA-DR3 or DR4 alleles, or having a first-degree relative with type 1 diabetes. The mean follow-up was 4.8 years. Risk of CDA defined as being positive for tissue transglutaminase (tTG) autoantibody on 2 or more consecutive visits or being positive for tTG once and having a positive small bowel biopsy for celiac disease, by timing of introduction of gluten-containing foods into the diet. Fifty-one children developed CDA. Findings adjusted for HLA-DR3 status indicated that children exposed to foods containing wheat, barley, or rye (gluten-containing foods) in the first 3 months of life (3 [6%] CDA positive vs 40 [3%] CDA negative) had a 5-fold increased risk of CDA compared with children exposed to gluten-containing foods at 4 to 6 months (12 [23%] CDA positive vs 574 [38%] CDA negative) (hazard ratio [HR], 5.17; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.44-18.57). Children not exposed to gluten until the seventh month or later (36 [71%] CDA positive vs 895 [59%] CDA negative) had a marginally increased risk of CDA compared with those exposed at 4 to 6 months (HR, 1.87; 95% CI, 0.97-3.60). After restricting our case group to only the 25 CDA-positive children who had biopsy-diagnosed celiac disease, initial exposure to wheat, barley, or rye in the first 3 months (3 [12%] CDA positive vs 40 [3%] CDA negative) or in the seventh month or later (19 [76%] CDA positive vs 912 [59%] CDA negative) significantly increased risk of CDA compared with exposure at 4 to 6 months (3 [12%] CDA positive vs 583 [38%] CDA negative) (HR, 22.97; 95% CI, 4.55-115.93; P = .001; and HR, 3.98; 95% CI, 1.18-13.46; P = .04, respectively). Timing of introduction of gluten into the infant diet is associated with the appearance of CDA in children at increased risk for the disease.","A prospective observational study (N=1560) of infants at increased risk of celiac disease (defined as having either the HLA-DR3 or DR4 allele) determined that the optimum time for introducing gluten-containing foods is 4 to 6 months. Infants exposed in the first 3 months of life had a 5-fold increased risk of developing celiac disease, and babies exposed after the sixth month had nearly a 2-fold increased risk."
"Does treatment with donepezil improve memory for patients with mild cognitive impairment
To evaluate the efficacy and safety of the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor donepezil in a placebo-controlled trial in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). A total of 270 patients with MCI were enrolled in a 24-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Patients were randomized to receive donepezil (n = 133; 5 mg/day for 42 days, followed by forced dose escalation to 10 mg/day) or placebo (n = 137). Primary efficacy measures were the New York University (NYU) Paragraph Delayed Recall test and the Alzheimer disease (AD) Cooperative Study Clinician's Global Impression of Change for MCI (ADCS CGIC-MCI). Secondary efficacy measures included the modified AD Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog), the Patient Global Assessment (PGA), and additional neuropsychologic measures. Efficacy analyses were performed on intent-to-treat (ITT) and fully evaluable (FE) populations. Primary efficacy measures of the NYU Paragraph Recall test and the ADCS CGIC-MCI did not show significant treatment effects in the ITT population. Some secondary measures showed effects favoring donepezil. More donepezil-treated patients showed improvements in ADAS-cog total scores, in tests of attention and psychomotor speed, and in PGA scores. More donepezil-treated than placebo-treated patients experienced adverse events, most of which were mild to moderate and transient. Although significant treatment effects were not seen in the primary efficacy measures, outcomes on secondary measures suggest promising directions for further evaluation of donepezil treatment in patients with MCI.","A 24-week multicenter randomized controlled trials included 270 patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment. Patients were randomized to receive placebo or donepezil (5 mg/d for 42 days, followed by 10 mg/d). The primary end-points were changes on the New York University Paragraph Delayed Recall test and the Alzheimer's disease Cooperative Study Clinician's Global Impression of Change for Mild Cognitive Impairment (ADCS CGIC-MCI). No significant differences were found in the primary endpoints at 24 weeks-32.6% in the donepezil group vs 24.3 % in the placebo group showed minimal or moderate improvement, and 51.7% in the donepezil group vs 60.4% in the placebo group showed no change. Secondary endpoints included the modified ADAS-cog, the Patient global Assessment (PGA) and other neuropsychological tests. The ADAS-cog focuses on psychomotor speed and attention tests. Analysis of the ADAS-cog favored the donepezil group, with 22.3% showing a ≥7-point score vs 12.1% in the placebo group. There were no significant differences on the PGA in the intention-to-treat analysis. The donepezil group had a higher rate of adverse drug reactions (P<.03) including diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, leg cramps, and abnormal dreams. The discontinuation rate was 22% in the donepezil group compared with 8% in the placebo group (number needed to harm=7)."
"What screening tests should you use to evaluate a man with low testosterone
Many studies have shown cross-sectional (and two small studies, longitudinal) declines in total and/or free testosterone (T) levels, with age, in men. The extent to which decline in T is the result of the aging process per se, as opposed to chronic illness, medication use, and other age-related factors, remains controversial. The frequency with which aging leads to T levels consistent with hypogonadism has also not been defined. These issues bear on the potential use of T replacement in aging men, because aging and hypogonadism have, in common, reduced bone and lean body mass and muscle strength and increased total and abdominal fat. We measured T and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), by RIA, in stored samples from 890 men in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study on Aging. Using a mixed-effects model, we found independent effects of age and date of sampling to reduce T levels. After compensating for date effects, which investigation suggested was artifactual, we observed significant, independent, age-invariant, longitudinal effects of age on both T and free T index (free T index = T/SHBG), with an average change of -0.124 nmol/L.yr and -0.0049 nmol T/nmol SHBG.yr. T, but not free T index, also decreased with increasing body mass index. Use of beta-blocking drugs was associated with higher T and higher free T index levels. Using total T criteria, incidence of hypogonadal T levels increased to about 20% of men over 60, 30% over 70 and 50% over 80 yr of age, and even greater percentages when free T index criteria were employed. Our observations of health factor independent, age-related longitudinal decreases in T and free T, resulting in a high frequency of hypogonadal values, suggest that further investigation of T replacement in aged men, perhaps targeted to those with the lowest serum T concentrations, are justified.","In a series of 3 studies, 30% (26 of 89) of men with hemochromatosis had hypogonadism. The prevalence of hemochromatosis in males with hypogonadism has not been reported."
"What treatments prevent miscarriage after recurrent pregnancy loss
There may be an association between recurrent miscarriage and abnormal hormone function in the follicular phase. Human chorionic gonadotrophin may play a role in preventing miscarriages. The objective of this review was to assess the effects of human chorionic gonadotrophin administration during early pregnancy on the risk of miscarriage in women with a history of recurrent miscarriage. The Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group trials register was searched. Date of last search: 9 January 1998. Randomised trials of human chorionic gonadotrophin compared with placebo or no treatment in women who have had two or more miscarriages. Eligibility and trial quality were assessed by one reviewer. Four trials involving 180 women were included. The trials were of variable quality. Human chorionic gonadotrophin was associated with a reduced risk of miscarriage for women with a history of recurrent miscarriage (odds ratio 0.26, 95% confidence interval 0.14 to 0.52). This result should be interpreted cautiously because the apparent effect is greatly influenced by the two methodologically weaker studies. There is not enough evidence to evaluate the use of human chorionic gonadotrophin during pregnancy in order to prevent miscarriage in women with a history of unexplained recurrent spontaneous miscarriage.","A meta-analysis reviewed 4 trials (n=180 total) of varying methodological quality, which were constructed to determine if women, with at least 2 consecutive miscarriages of unknown cause, derive any protective effect when they receive human chorionic gonadotrophin during the first trimester. Although the overall outcome favored the use of human chorionic gonadotrophin (OR=0.26 compared with placebo; 95% CI, 0.14-0.52), the trials contained major methodological weaknesses (poor description of methods, no power calculations, selection and unclear randomization techniques)."
"What is the best way to manage phantom limb pain
To evaluate whether amitriptyline is more effective than placebo in improving phantom limb pain or residual limb pain. Randomized controlled trial of amitriptyline for 6 weeks. University hospital. Thirty-nine persons with amputation-related pain lasting more than 6 months. Six-week trial of amitriptyline (titrated up to 125 mg/d) or an active placebo (benztropine mesylate). Analyses were conducted to examine whether there was a medication group effect on the primary outcomes (average pain intensity) and secondary outcome measures (disability, satisfaction with life, handicap). No significant differences were found between the treatment groups in outcome variables when controlling for initial pain scores. Our findings do not support the use of amitriptyline in the treatment of postamputation pain.","Despite the proven benefit of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) in other neuropathic pain conditions, a recent randomized controlled trials demonstrated no benefit of TCAs over placebo in PLP."
"Does warfarin prevent deep venous thrombosis in high-risk patients
A recent double-blind, randomized trial demonstrated that very low-dose warfarin (VLDW) reduced the incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) without increasing the rate of bleeding in women with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy. We have evaluated the economic impact on the health care system of using VLDW in such patients. The records of patients entered onto the trial and a simultaneous, fully allocated, costing model for a tertiary care hospital in Hamilton, Canada were used to determine the difference in costs associated with the care of patients with and without VLDW. The cost of providing VLDW was $ 21,854 (Canadian dollars) per 100 patients. This therapy led to a reduction in costs of $ 24,297 per 100 patients, thus saving the health care system $ 2,443 per 100 patients. In the sensitivity analysis, VLDW prophylaxis still did not increase health care costs unless the cost of VLDW was greatly increased, the cost of treating thromboembolic episodes was markedly reduced, or the incidence of either VTE or bleeding with VLDW was increased above the rates observed in the trial. We conclude that for women receiving chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer, the benefits of VLDW can be realized without increased health care costs.",A cost analysis showed that very-low-dose warfarin can be used in prevention of deep venous thrombosis in breast cancer patients on chemotherapy without an increase in health care costs.
"Can infants/toddlers get enough fluoride through brushing
To assess the impact of regularly supplying free fluoride toothpaste regularly to children, initially aged 12 months, and living in deprived areas of the north west of England on the level of caries in the deciduous dentition at 5-6 years of age. A further aim was to compare the effectiveness of a programme using a toothpaste containing 440 ppmF (Colgate 0-6 Gel) with one containing 1,450 ppmF (Colgate Great Regular Flavour) in reducing caries. Randomised controlled parallel group clinical trial. Clinical data were collected from test and control groups when the children were 5-6 years old. A programme of posting toothpaste with dental health messages to the homes of children initially aged 12 months. Clinical examinations took place in primary schools. 7,422 children born in 3-month birth cohorts living in high caries areas in nine health districts in north west England. Within each district children were randomly assigned to test or control groups. Toothpaste, containing either 440 ppmF or 1450 ppmF, and dental health literature posted at three monthly intervals to children in test groups until they were aged 5-6 years. The dmft index, missing teeth and the prevalence of caries experience. An analysis of 3,731 children who were examined and remained in the programme showed the mean dmft to be 2.15 for the group who had received 1,450 ppmF toothpaste and 2.49 for the 440 ppmF group. The mean dmft for the control group was 2.57. This 16% reduction between the 1,450 ppmF and control group was statistically significant (P<0.05). The difference between the 440 ppmF group and control was not significant. Further analyses to estimate the population effect of the programme also confirmed this relationship. This study demonstrates that a programme distributing free toothpaste containing 1,450 ppmF provides a significant clinical benefit for high caries risk children living in deprived, non-fluoridated districts.","Another randomized controlled trial, carried out in an area without fluoridated water, found the high-fluoride-concentration toothpaste (1450 ppm F) resulted in 16% fewer caries in children, while the low-fluoride-concentration toothpaste (440 ppm F) was no different than placebo."
"What are the most effective nonpharmacologic therapies for irritable bowel syndrome
Both high-fibre dietary advice and the prescription of fibre as a bulking agent are very common in primary and secondary care management of irritable bowel syndrome. Irritable bowel syndrome patients with constipation may have delayed intestinal transit. Therefore, fibres that accelerate intestinal transit may be beneficial in these patients. The uncertain benefits reported in several clinical studies, however, have led us to reappraise the value of fibre in irritable bowel syndrome management. To quantify the effect of different types of fibre on global and symptom relief from irritable bowel syndrome. Using a structured literature search in MEDLINE (1966-2002), we selected randomized controlled trials involving irritable bowel syndrome patients treated with fibre. Analyses were performed for the total group and for trials using soluble and insoluble fibre separately. Seventeen studies were included in the analysis. None investigated primary care irritable bowel syndrome patients. Fibre, in general, was effective in the relief of global irritable bowel syndrome symptoms [relative risk, 1.33; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.19-1.50]. Irritable bowel syndrome patients with constipation may receive benefit from fibre treatment (relative risk, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.21-2.02), but there was no evidence that fibre was effective in the relief of abdominal pain in irritable bowel syndrome. Soluble and insoluble fibre, separately, had different effects on global irritable bowel syndrome symptoms. Soluble fibre (psyllium, ispaghula, calcium polycarbophil) showed significant improvement (relative risk, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.35-1.78), whereas insoluble fibre (corn, wheat bran), in some cases, worsened the clinical outcome, but there was no significant difference compared with placebo (relative risk, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.72-1.11). The benefits of fibre in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome are marginal for global irritable bowel syndrome symptom improvement and irritable bowel syndrome-related constipation. Soluble and insoluble fibres have different effects on global irritable bowel syndrome symptoms. Indeed, in some cases, insoluble fibres may worsen the clinical outcome. Future clinical studies evaluating the effect and tolerability of fibre therapy are needed in primary care.","A systematic review of 17 RCTs (9 of soluble fiber, 8 of insoluble) (N=1363) found soluble fiber more effective than placebo (pooled RR=1.55; 95% CI, 1.35-1.78) for reduction in global symptoms and constipation. Insoluble fiber was no better than placebo (pooled RR=0.89; 95% CI, 0.72-1.11). Abdominal pain was not reduced with either fiber."
"Which drugs are safest for moderate to severe depression in adolescents
This summary provides an overview of the assessment and treatment recommendations contained in the Practice Parameters for the Assessment and Treatment of Children and Adolescents with Depressive Disorders. Depressive disorders in children and adolescents are marked by core symptoms similar to those seen in adults, although symptom expression varies greatly with developmental stage. These disorders are common, chronic, and recurrent, and they are associated with comorbid psychiatric conditions and poor outcome that can be alleviated by early identification and treatment. Opinions differ regarding treatment planning and duration of treatment required. Development of a treatment relationship with the patient and family is crucial for a successful outcome. Psychotherapy is an appropriate treatment for all children and adolescents with depressive disorders. Antidepressants may prove useful in some cases and are especially recommended for patients with psychosis, bipolar depression, and severe depression. Continuation treatment is necessary in all patients after the acute phase; long-term maintenance is required in some. Early detection and intervention is effective in ameliorating the poor psychosocial outcome.","The food and drug administration encourages patients taking antidepressants and their families to be alert for signs of impulsive behavior or suicidal tendencies and to have a safety plan. The FDA, American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, and the Society for Adolescent Medicine endorse close follow-up with periodic objective assessment."
"Does regular exercise reduce the pain and stiffness of osteoarthritis
To determine whether land based therapeutic exercise is beneficial for people with osteoarthritis (OA) of the hip or knee in terms of reduced joint pain, improved physical function, and/or the patient's global assessment of therapeutic effectiveness. Five databases were searched for randomized clinical trials. Standardized mean differences (SMD) with their 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for each study and then combined using a fixed effects model. Only 2 studies, totaling about 100 participants, could potentially provide data on people with hip OA. Fourteen studies provided data on 1633 participants with knee OA. Nine of these studies were considered of high methodological quality. For pain, combining the results revealed a mean moderate beneficial effect (SMD 0.46, 95% Cl 0.35, 0.57), while for self-reported physical function a mean small beneficial effect (SMD 0.33, 95% CI 0.23, 0.43) was found. These results appeared to be sensitive to blinding of outcome assessor and choice of control group. Land based therapeutic exercise was shown to reduce pain and improve physical function for people with OA of the knee.","A systematic review examined the effect of therapeutic exercise on hip and knee osteoarthritis. The standardized mean difference in effect size for pain reduction was moderate, 0.46 (95% CI, 0.35-0.57). For self-reported physical functioning, the standardized mean difference was small, 0.33 (95% CI, 0.23-0.43). Study limitations included enrollment of patients with only early or mild osteoarthritis, low numbers of intent-to-treat studies, short-term nature of the studies, and inadequate sample sizes."
"How should you manage a depressed patient unresponsive to an SSRI
Few controlled studies have addressed the issue of which antidepressant medications should be recommended for outpatients who have not responded to multiple treatment trials. This study compared the efficacy of switching to mirtazapine to that of switching to a tricyclic antidepressant (nortriptyline) following two prospective, consecutive, unsuccessful medication treatments for nonpsychotic major depressive disorder. Following lack of remission or an inability to tolerate an initial trial of citalopram for up to 12 weeks (first step) and a second trial with either monotherapy involving another antidepressant or augmentation of citalopram with bupropion or buspirone (second step), adult outpatients (N=235) with nonpsychotic major depressive disorder were randomly assigned to 14 weeks of treatment with mirtazapine (up to 60 mg/day) (N=114) or nortriptyline (up to 200 mg/day) (N=121). The primary outcome, symptom remission, was defined a priori as a total exit score of </=7 on the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression. The 16-item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self-Report (QIDS-SR(16)), obtained at treatment visits, provided secondary outcomes of remission (score </=5 at exit) and response (>/=50% reduction in score from baseline). For mirtazapine, remission rates were 12.3% and 8.0% per the Hamilton and QIDS-SR(16) scores, respectively. For nortriptyline, remission rates were 19.8% and 12.4%, respectively. QIDS-SR(16) response rates were 13.4% for mirtazapine and 16.5% for nortriptyline. Neither response nor remission rates statistically differed by treatment, nor did these two treatments differ in tolerability or adverse events. Switching to a third antidepressant monotherapy regimen after two consecutive unsuccessful antidepressant trials resulted in low remission rates (<20%) among patients with major depressive disorder.",Further switches in antidepressant monotherapy have a low success rate (10%-20%).
"Do OTC remedies relieve cough in acute URIs
Over the past 20 years, the use of zinc as an over-the-counter alternative therapy for the common cold has vastly grown in popularity. Recent reports of potentially permanent anosmia caused by intranasal zinc therapy warrant careful analysis of the therapeutic effects of zinc. A search of the Medline database (including articles published during 1966-2006) for studies of zinc and the common cold produced 105 published reports. Fourteen were randomized, placebo-controlled studies that examined the effect of zinc lozenges, nasal sprays, or nasal gels on naturally acquired common colds. Eleven features of experimental design affecting signal quality, chance, bias, and blinding were used to evaluate the 14 placebo-controlled studies. These criteria were validated case definition, quantifiable hypothesis, sample size calculation, randomized assignment, double blinding, proof of blinding, measurement of compliance, measurement of dropout rate, analysis by intent to treat, description of methods of analysis, and measurements of probability. Equal weight was given to each criterion, because failure to meet any one could potentially invalidate the findings of a clinical trial. Four studies met all 11 criteria. Three of these studies reported no therapeutic effect from zinc lozenge or nasal spray. One study reported positive results from zinc nasal gel. Of the remaining 10 studies, 6 reported a positive effect and 4 reported no effect. Intent-to-treat analysis was the most common criterion not met. This structured review suggests that the therapeutic effectiveness of zinc lozenges has yet to be established. One well-designed study did report a positive effect of zinc nasal gel.",A recent systematic review showed mixed results: Half the studies found no benefit for zinc in treating upper respiratory infection.
"What is the appropriate use of sunscreen for infants and children
Previous epidemiologic studies have suggested that sunscreen use is associated with an increased risk of melanoma skin cancer. Because high nevi (mole) count in adults is a strong predictor of melanoma, we conducted a study examining the number of nevi in 6- to 7-year-old European children, according to their sunscreen use. Whole-body and site-specific counts of nevi 2 mm or larger were performed in 631 children in their first year of primary school in four European cities. Independently, parents were interviewed regarding sun exposure, sunscreen use, and physical sun protection of their child. After adjustment for sun exposure and host characteristics (e.g., skin phototype, eye color), the relative risk for high nevus count on the trunk was 1.68 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.09-2.59) for the highest level of sunscreen use and 0.59 (95% CI = 0.36-0.97) for the highest level of wearing of clothes while in the sun. The sun protection factor had no effect on nevus counts despite a high median value of 17.4. Sunburn number was not associated with nevus count. The highest risk associated with sunscreen use was found among children who had never experienced sunburn. In white, European children, sunscreen use appears to be associated with development of nevi, probably because it allows longer sun exposures. Wearing clothes may be an effective way to prevent proliferation of nevi. Since a high nevus count is a strong predictor of melanoma, sunscreen use may be involved in melanoma occurrence because it may encourage recreational sun exposure.","A retrospective study of 6- to 7-year-old children found that sunscreen use correlated with an increasing number of nevi, though wearing clothing to cover skin while in the sun was protective."
"What is the best treatment for impacted cerumen
Assessment of the tympanic membrane is often impeded by the presence of cerumen. We compared the ceruminolytic effects of triethanolamine polypeptide and docusate sodium in patients with cerumen. We conducted a prospective, randomized, controlled, double-blind trial on a convenience sample of cooperative adult and pediatric patients presenting to a university-based emergency department who required removal of cerumen to visualize the tympanic membrane. Structured data collection was performed, and the physician determined whether visualization of the tympanic membrane was partially or totally obscured by cerumen (interobserver agreement, rho=0.79). Patients received intra-aural instillation of 1mL of either docusate sodium or triethanolamine polypeptide in a liquid form. If not completely cleared within 15 minutes, the external ear canal was irrigated with 50 or 100 mL of normal saline solution and additional attempts to visualize the tympanic membrane were made. The main outcome was the proportion of ears in which the tympanic membrane could be totally visualized after ceruminolytic instillation with or without irrigation. This study had 80% power to detect a 40% difference between groups in the proportion of totally visualized tympanic membranes (chi(2) test, alpha=.05). Of 50 enrolled patients, 23 received triethanolamine polypeptide and 27 received docusate sodium. Mean patient age was 40 years (range 1 to 81 years); 35% were female. Groups were similar in age, sex, and proportion of completely obscured tympanic membranes at presentation (78%). The ability to completely visualize the tympanic membrane was significantly greater after treatment with docusate sodium versus triethanolamine polypeptide (81% versus 35%; difference in proportions 47%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 22 to 71) particularly in children aged 5 or less (90% versus 0%; difference in proportions 89%; 95% CI 50 to 100). Docusate sodium solution is a more effective ceruminolytic than triethanolamine polypeptide, allowing complete or partial visualization of the tympanic membrane in most patients after a single application when followed with irrigation. Use of docusate sodium as a ceruminolytic should be encouraged, particularly in children.","In studies that evaluated onetime softening in the office to ease or eliminate the need for irrigation, a presoak with docusate sodium (Colace) was most effective, although its effects were not compared with those of water."
"What is the appropriate diagnostic evaluation of fibroids
To assess whether sonohysterography provides added diagnostic value over transvaginal sonography in patients with suspected or known myomas by comparing diagnostic confidence, interobserver agreement, accuracy, and change in diagnoses when 2 independent observers interpreted transvaginal sonography alone and later interpreted transvaginal sonography and sonohysterography together. Hard copy images from 72 women were interpreted independently by 2 sonologists on separate occasions, rating parameters (abnormal uterus, myoma in any location, submucous myoma, classification of location of a submucous myoma with respect to the uterine cavity, myoma remote from the cavity, adenomyosis, and focal and diffuse endometrial lesions) on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 indicated definitely no; 2, probably no; 3, uncertain; 4, probably yes; and 5, definitely yes). Correlation was made with clinical and imaging follow-up, surgery, and pathologic examination. The added information provided by sonohysterography resulted in improved diagnostic confidence for most parameters. Interobserver agreement was markedly improved for the diagnosis and location of submucous myomas and focal endometrial lesions. Sensitivity values for submucous myomas and focal endometrial lesions were 100% and 90% for transvaginal sonography and sonohysterography together and 100% and 70% for transvaginal sonography alone. We found that sonohysterography does provide additional information over transvaginal sonography alone and is an important adjunct to transvaginal sonography in symptomatic women with known or suspected myomas, particularly before surgical or medical therapy.","Additional diagnostic testing is indicated for patients with suspected fibroids and abnormal uterine bleeding, increased pelvic girth, pelvic pressure contributing to urinary frequency or constipation, or pelvic pain with intercourse or other physical activity."
"Should people with a first-degree relative who died from subarachnoid hemorrhage be screened for aneurysms
Family screening programs for intracranial aneurysms have been considered but there are concerns about raised anxiety and depression, inadequate risk perception, and the principle of informed choice. Observational study in 980 first-degree relatives of 172 patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage. After being informed, consenting subjects completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), answered standardized questions on perceived risk, and responded to a list of statements about the decision-making process. 166 subjects (21%) declined the screening offer. 12% of the participants reported HADS anxiety scores in the moderate to severe range; 2% did so for feelings of depression. All relatives substantially underestimated the risk of harboring an aneurysm and of aneurysm rupture. 98% of the participants (96% of non-participants, P = 0.60) reported feeling free to make a choice, while 31% of the participants (42% of non-participants, P = 0.16) felt more or less compelled to participate in the screening program. The invitation to a family screening program for intracranial aneurysms does not lead to increased feelings of anxiety or depression. The unrealistic risk perception stresses the need of clear and detailed information. Attention should be given to factors that may interfere with the principle of informed choice.",An observational study of 980 first-degree relatives of patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage determined that offering screening for islet cell antibodies did not provoke anxiety or depression.
"When should acute nonvenereal conjunctivitis be treated with topical antibiotics
There has been uncertainty about whether antibiotic therapy confers significant benefit in the treatment of acute bacterial conjunctivitis. This study aimed to assess the efficacy of antibiotic therapy in the management of acute bacterial conjunctivitis. Using standard Cochrane search methods, we identified double-blind randomised controlled trials in which any form of antibiotic treatment (topical, systemic or combination) had been compared with placebo in the management of acute bacterial conjunctivitis. Data extraction and analysis followed a pre-defined protocol. Meta-analysis was performed to obtain summary measures of relative risk. Six published trials were identified, of which three fulfilled the eligibility criteria for inclusion in this review. The trials were heterogeneous in terms of their inclusion and exclusion criteria, the nature of the intervention, and the outcome measures assessed. Meta-analysis indicates that acute bacterial conjunctivitis is frequently a self-limiting condition, as clinical remission occurred by days 2 to 5 in 64% (95% confidence interval (CI) = 57-71) of those treated with placebo. Treatment with antibiotics was, however, associated with significantly better rates of clinical remission (days 2 to 5: relative risk (RR) = 1.31, 95% CI = 1.11-1.55), with a suggestion that this benefit was maintained for late clinical remission (days 6 to 10: RR = 1.27, 95% CI = 1.00-1.61). Acute bacterial conjunctivitis is frequently a self-limiting condition but the use of antibiotics is associated with significantly improved rates of early clinical remission, and early and late microbiological remission. Since trials to date have been conducted in selected specialist care patient populations, generalisation of these results to a primary care-based population should be undertaken with a degree of caution.","The rate of spontaneous remission is much higher for adults than for children (71.6% vs 28%, respectively). The Cochrane meta-analysis reported a similar clinical cure rate in children for 6 to 10 days of treatment with topical antibiotics versus placebo. A systematic review of 5 placebo-controlled RCTs reported no serious adverse outcomes in conjunctivitis patients regardless of treatment group."
"In patients with a previous CVA, do antioxidants protect against subsequent stroke
Antioxidants increase the resistance of low-density lipoprotein to oxidation and may thereby reduce risk for atherosclerosis. To determine whether intake of vitamin E, vitamin C, or carotenoids predict risk for total or ischemic stroke. Prospective observational study. The Health Professionals Follow-up Study. 43,738 men 40 to 75 years of age who did not have cardiovascular disease or diabetes. Repeated and validated dietary assessments were done by using a self-administered 131-item food-frequency questionnaire, which included questions on dose and duration of vitamin supplement use. The follow-up period was 8 years. A total of 328 strokes occurred: 210 ischemic, 70 hemorrhagic, and 48 unclassified. After adjustment for age, smoking, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, body mass index, physical activity, parental history of myocardial infarction, alcohol consumption, and total energy intake, the relative risk for ischemic stroke in the top quintile of vitamin E intake (median, 411 IU/d) compared with the bottom quintile (5.4 IU/d) was 1.18 (95% CI, 0.77 to 1.82). The relative risk for ischemic stroke in the top quintile of vitamin C intake (1167 mg/d) compared with the bottom quintile (95 mg/d) was 1.03 (CI, 0.66 to 1.59). Results for total stroke were similar. Associations of vitamin intake with hemorrhagic stroke were also nonsignificant, but the CIs were wide. Neither dose nor duration of vitamin E or vitamin C supplement use was related to risk for total or ischemic stroke. The relative risk for ischemic stroke was 1.16 (CI, 0.81 to 1.67) in men using 250 IU or more of vitamin E supplementation per day compared with men who used no vitamin E supplements and was 0.93 (CI, 0.60 to 1.45) in men using 700 mg or more of vitamin C supplementation per day compared with men who used no vitamin C supplements. A significant inverse relation between lutein intake and risk for ischemic stroke was seen but was not independent of other dietary factors. Vitamin E and vitamin C supplements and specific carotenoids did not seem to substantially reduce risk for stroke in this cohort. Modest effects, however, cannot be excluded.","Although prior observational studies have hinted at a link between antioxidants and improved cardiovascular outcomes, the recently published Health Professionals Follow-up Study found no benefit to vitamin C or E in preventing strokes, based on the dietary assessment of 43,738 men, aged 40 to 75 years, who were not known to have cardiovascular disease or diabetes."
"When and how should you evaluate a child for obstructive sleep apnea
To determine the utility of pulse oximetry for diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in children. We performed a cross-sectional study of 349 patients referred to a pediatric sleep laboratory for possible OSA. A mixed/obstructive apnea/hypopnea index (MOAHI) greater than or equal to 1 on nocturnal polysomnography (PSG) defined OSA. A sleep laboratory physician read nocturnal oximetry trend and event graphs, blinded to clinical and polysomnographic results. Likelihood ratios were used to determine the change in probability of having OSA before and after oximetry results were known. Of 349 patients, 210 (60%) had OSA as defined polysomnographically. Oximetry trend graphs were classified as positive for OSA in 93 and negative or inconclusive in 256 patients. Of the 93 oximetry results read as positive, PSG confirmed OSA in 90 patients. A positive oximetry trend graph had a likelihood ratio of 19.4, increasing the probability of having OSA from 60% to 97%. The median MOAHI of children with a positive oximetry result was 16.4 (7.5, 30.2). The 3 false-positive oximetry results were all in the subgroup of 92 children who had diagnoses other than adenotonsillar hypertrophy that might have affected breathing during sleep. A negative or inconclusive oximetry result had a likelihood ratio of.58, decreasing the probability of having OSA from 60% to 47%. Interobserver reliability for oximetry readings was very good to excellent (kappa =.80). In the setting of a child suspected of having OSA, a positive nocturnal oximetry trend graph has at least a 97% positive predictive value. Oximetry could: 1) be the definitive diagnostic test for straightforward OSA attributable to adenotonsillar hypertrophy in children older than 12 months of age, or 2) quickly and inexpensively identify children with a history suggesting sleep-disordered breathing who would require PSG to elucidate the type and severity. A negative oximetry result cannot be used to rule out OSA.","A retrospective, cross-sectional study of 349 children between the ages of 6 months and 18 years determined that abnormal home pulse oximetry studies were highly predictive of obstructive sleep apnea on polysomnography (positive likelihood ratio [LR+]=19.4; CIs not given; posttest probability=97%), but that inconclusive or normal pulse oximetry studies were not predictive of negative polysomnographies (LR+=0.58; CIs not given; posttest probability 47%). Children had been referred for suspected obstructive sleep apnea, and the pretest probability was 60%. Oximetry records were evaluated by a sleep laboratory physician blinded to clinical and polysomnography data."
"What is the best treatment for oral thrush in healthy infants
To compare the efficacy, safety, and tolerance of fluconazole suspension versus nystatin in the treatment of oropharyngeal thrush in immunocompromised children. Multicenter, randomized, observer-masked trial. Thirty-two centers participated, including hospitals and ambulatory care clinics. We enrolled 182 immunocompromised infants and children, ages 5 months to 14 years, with signs of oral thrush and presence of yeasts on potassium hydroxide- or gram-stained preparations. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive a single daily dose of fluconazole suspension, 2 to 3 mg/kg per day, or nystatin, 400,000 units four times daily for 14 days; 159 patients, who had culture confirmation of thrush and received at least 7 days of study drug, were evaluated for efficacy; all patients were evaluated for safety. Clinical cure was demonstrated in 91% of the subjects in the fluconazole group and 51% of the subjects in the nystatin group (p < 0.001), and eradication of the organism cultured at entry occurred in 76% and 11% (p < 0.001), respectively. Gastrointestinal conditions developed in six patients who received fluconazole and in three who received nystatin; two fluconazole recipients were subsequently withdrawn from the study. Laboratory abnormalities occurred with equal frequency in both groups. Clinical relapse rates were similar in both groups at 2 weeks (18% and 24% for fluconazole and nystatin, respectively) and 1 month (28% and 27%, respectively) after the completion of study drug. Fluconazole suspension is more effective than nystatin in the treatment of thrush in immunocompromised children. Both regimens were well tolerated.","Fluconazole has been shown to be effective, safe, and easy to use to treat thrush in immunocompromised children, but has not been approved by the food and drug administration for use in healthy infants."
"Which technique for removing nevi is least scarring
An accurate initial biopsy of the deepest portion of the melanoma is vital to the management of patients with melanomas. Our goal was to evaluate the accuracy of preliminary biopsies performed by a group of predominantly experienced dermatologists (n = 46/72). A total of 145 cases of cutaneous melanoma were examined retrospectively. We compared Breslow depth on preliminary biopsy with Breslow depth on subsequent excision. Was the initial diagnostic biopsy performed on the deepest part of the melanoma? Of nonexcisional initial shave and punch biopsies, 88% were accurate, with Breslow depth greater than or equal to subsequent excision Breslow depth. Both superficial and deep shave biopsies were more accurate than punch biopsy for melanomas less than 1 mm. Excisional biopsy was found to be the most accurate method of biopsy. Deep shave biopsy is preferable to superficial shave or punch biopsy for thin and intermediate depth (<2 mm) melanomas when an initial sample is taken for diagnosis instead of complete excision. We found that a group of predominantly experienced dermatologists accurately assessed the depth of invasive melanoma by use of a variety of initial biopsy types.","A retrospective study compared the Breslow depth determination of 4 different biopsy techniques, performed by experienced dermatologists, with the subsequent depth on definitive surgery for melanoma. This study found that superficial shave, deep shave, and punch biopsy predicted the Breslow depth 88% (95/108) of the time. As expected, excisional biopsy predicted the depth 100% (30/30) of the time. The location of the biopsy sites were not reported. The choice of biopsy was influenced by the suspicion of melanoma; thin (< 1 mm) melanomas were more likely to be superficially shaved than deep-shaved or punched."
"Are there big differences among beta-blockers in treating essential hypertension
In a recently published meta-analysis, investigators asserted that beta-blockers should not be used to treat hypertension. Because the pathophysiology of hypertension differs in older and younger patients, we designed this meta-analysis to clarify the efficacy of beta-blockers in different age groups. The primary outcome was a composite of stroke, myocardial infarction and death. We identified randomized controlled trials that evaluated the efficacy of beta-blockers as first-line therapy for hypertension in preventing major cardiovascular outcomes. Both authors independently evaluated the eligibility of all trials. Trials enrolling older (mean age at baseline > or = 60 years) patients were separated from those enrolling younger (mean age < 60 years) patients. Data were pooled using a random effects model. Our analysis incorporated data from 145 811 participants in 21 hypertension trials. In placebo-controlled trials, beta-blockers reduced major cardiovascular outcomes in younger patients (risk ratio [RR] 0.86, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.74-0.99, based on 794 events in 19 414 patients) but not in older patients (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.75-1.05, based on 1115 events in 8019 patients). In active comparator trials, beta-blockers demonstrated similar efficacy to other antihypertensive agents in younger patients (1515 events in 30 412 patients, RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.88-1.07) but not in older patients (7405 events in 79 775 patients, RR 1.06, 95% CI 1.01-1.10), with the excess risk being particularly marked for strokes (RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.07-1.30). beta-blockers should not be considered first-line therapy for older hypertensive patients without another indication for these agents; however, in younger patients beta-blockers are associated with a significant reduction in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.","A subsequent meta-analysis found that beta-blocker therapy in younger patients (less than 60 years of age) is associated with a significant reduction in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Researchers used data from 145,811 participants in 21 hypertension trials, beta-blockers reduced major cardiovascular outcomes in younger patients (risk ratio=0.86; 95% CI, 0.74-0.99) but not in older patients (risk ratio=0.89; 95% CI, 0.75-1.05)."
"Is pneumococcal vaccine effective in nursing home patients
On April 24,2001, seven cases of pneumococcal pneumonia with bacteremia among residents of a nursing home were reported to the Hamilton Township Department of Health, New Jersey; all seven diagnoses were confirmed with blood cultures positive for Streptococcus pneumoniae. Illness onset among the residents occurred during April 3-24; four residents died. The New Jersey Department of Health and Senior Services (NJDHSS) was notified on April 24 and initiated an investigation to identify additional cases and implement control efforts. This report summarizes results of the investigation, which underscore the importance of providing pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV) to elderly residents of long-term care facilities (LTCFs).","The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reported outbreaks of invasive pneumococcal disease in nursing homes where vaccination rates are low. Pneumococcal bacteremia is seen in only 10%-20% of patients with pneumococcal pneumonia but confers a significant risk of death. Therefore, pneumococcal vaccination is indicated for patients ≥ 65 years or those with chronic medical conditions."
"Which postmenopausal women should be offered combined hormone replacement therapy
Observational studies have found lower rates of coronary heart disease (CHD) in postmenopausal women who take estrogen than in women who do not, but this potential benefit has not been confirmed in clinical trials. To determine if estrogen plus progestin therapy alters the risk for CHD events in postmenopausal women with established coronary disease. Randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled secondary prevention trial. Outpatient and community settings at 20 US clinical centers. A total of 2763 women with coronary disease, younger than 80 years, and postmenopausal with an intact uterus. Mean age was 66.7 years. Either 0.625 mg of conjugated equine estrogens plus 2.5 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate in 1 tablet daily (n = 1380) or a placebo of identical appearance (n = 1383). Follow-up averaged 4.1 years; 82% of those assigned to hormone treatment were taking it at the end of 1 year, and 75% at the end of 3 years. The primary outcome was the occurrence of nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) or CHD death. Secondary cardiovascular outcomes included coronary revascularization, unstable angina, congestive heart failure, resuscitated cardiac arrest, stroke or transient ischemic attack, and peripheral arterial disease. All-cause mortality was also considered. Overall, there were no significant differences between groups in the primary outcome or in any of the secondary cardiovascular outcomes: 172 women in the hormone group and 176 women in the placebo group had MI or CHD death (relative hazard [RH], 0.99; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.80-1.22). The lack of an overall effect occurred despite a net 11% lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level and 10% higher high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level in the hormone group compared with the placebo group (each P<.001). Within the overall null effect, there was a statistically significant time trend, with more CHD events in the hormone group than in the placebo group in year 1 and fewer in years 4 and 5. More women in the hormone group than in the placebo group experienced venous thromboembolic events (34 vs 12; RH, 2.89; 95% CI, 1.50-5.58) and gallbladder disease (84 vs 62; RH, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.00-1.92). There were no significant differences in several other end points for which power was limited, including fracture, cancer, and total mortality (131 vs 123 deaths; RH, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.84-1.38). During an average follow-up of 4.1 years, treatment with oral conjugated equine estrogen plus medroxyprogesterone acetate did not reduce the overall rate of CHD events in postmenopausal women with established coronary disease. The treatment did increase the rate of thromboembolic events and gallbladder disease. Based on the finding of no overall cardiovascular benefit and a pattern of early increase in risk of CHD events, we do not recommend starting this treatment for the purpose of secondary prevention of CHD. However, given the favorable pattern of CHD events after several years of therapy, it could be appropriate for women already receiving this treatment to continue.","The Heart and Estrogen/progestin Replacement Study (HERS) examined the effects of hormone replacement therapy in postmenopausal women with coronary artery disease. HERS was a large randomized controlled trial of 2763 women with an average follow-up time of 4.1 years. It showed no statistically significant difference between the hormone replacement therapy (estrogen plus medroxyprog-esterone) group compared with the placebo group in either the primary outcomes (nonfatal myocardial infarction or coronary heart disease death) or in the secondary outcomes (coronary revascularization, unstable angina, congestive heart failure, resuscitated cardiac arrest, stroke or transient ischemic attack, and peripheral arterial disease)."
"What is the best way to manage gastroesophageal reflux disease symptoms in the elderly
No placebo-controlled clinical trials have yet been published on the efficacy of therapy in older subjects with oesophagitis. To evaluate the efficacy of pantoprazole in preventing the recurrence of oesophagitis in elderly subjects. One hundred and sixty-four patients aged 65 years and over with acute oesophagitis were treated openly with pantoprazole, 40 mg daily, for 8 weeks. Patients with documented healing of erosive oesophagitis were then treated with pantoprazole, 20 mg daily, for 6 months. Thereafter, cured patients were randomized to receive pantoprazole, 20 mg daily, or placebo for the following 6 months. Clinical evaluations were performed every 2 months, and endoscopy was repeated after 8 weeks and after 6 and 12 months and/or whenever symptoms suggested a relapse of oesophagitis. After 8 weeks, the healing rates of oesophagitis were 81.1% (75.1-87.1%) and 93.7% (89.7-97.7%) by intention-to-treat and per protocol analyses, respectively. After 6 months, the corresponding values were 82% (75.4-88.5%) and 92.4% (87.6-97.2%), respectively. After 12 months, the per protocol and intention-to-treat healing rates of oesophagitis were 95.1% (88.5-100%) and 79.6% (68.3-90.9%), respectively, in the treatment group vs. 32.7% (19.9-45.4%) and 30.4% (18.3-42.4%), respectively, in the placebo group (P = 0.0001). Heartburn, acid regurgitation and chest pain were significantly associated with the relapse of oesophagitis (P = 0.0001), whereas hiatus hernia, Helicobacter pylori infection, concomitant diseases and treatments were not. In the elderly, pantoprazole was highly effective in healing and reducing the relapse of oesophagitis; discontinuing active treatment after 6 months was associated with a significant increase in the relapse rate.","A multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial of gastroesophageal reflux disease maintenance therapy started with an initial open phase in which elderly patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease and documented esophagitis were treated and then had documented resolution of esophagitis by endoscopy after 6 months. The researchers then randomized 105 of these elderly patients to receive treatment with either low-dose (20 mg/d) pantoprazole or placebo for 6 months. Endoscopy was performed after 12 months for all patients, unless indicated sooner. Intention-to-treat analysis showed a disease-free rate of 79.6% (95% CI, 68.3-90.9) in the treatment group, compared with 30.4% (95% CI, 18.3-42.4) in the placebo group (number needed to treat [NNT]=2). Symptom reports concerning the same patients also suggest a marked drop in symptoms that correlated with healing."
"Should we screen women for hypothyroidism
The objective of our study was to estimate the expected change in serum lipoprotein concentrations after treatment with T4 in patients with mild thyroid failure (i.e. subclinical hypothyroidism). Our data sources included MEDLINE, between January 1966 and May 1999, and review of references from relevant articles. There were 1,786 published studies identified, 461 abstracts reviewed, 74 articles retrieved, 24 articles evaluated against predetermined entry criteria, and 13 studies systematically reviewed and abstracted. All studies reported serum total cholesterol concentration changes during T4 treatment, 12 reported triglyceride changes, 10 reported high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol changes, and 9 reported low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol changes. There were 247 patients in 13 studies. The mean decrease in the serum total cholesterol concentration was -0.20 mmol/L (-7.9 mg/ dL), with a 95% confidence interval of -0.09 to -0.34. The decline in serum total cholesterol was directly proportional to its baseline concentration. Studies enrolling hypothyroid participants receiving suboptimal T4 doses reported significantly larger decreases in serum total cholesterol after thyroid-stimulating hormone normalization than studies enrolling previously untreated individuals with mild thyroid failure [-0.44 mmol/L (-17 mg/dL) vs. -0.14 mmol/L (-5.6 mg/dL), P = 0.05]. The change in serum LDL cholesterol concentration was -0.26 mmol/L (-10 mg/dL), with a 95% confidence interval of -0.12 to -0.41. Serum HDL and triglyceride concentrations showed no change. These results, although based on fewer than 250 patients, suggest that T4 therapy in individuals with mild thyroid failure lowers mean serum total and LDL cholesterol concentrations. The reduction in serum total cholesterol may be larger in individuals with higher pretreatment cholesterol levels and in hypothyroid individuals taking suboptimal T4 doses. There do not seem to be significant effects of T4 on serum HDL or triglyceride concentrations.","A meta-analysis combined 13 studies, involving 247 patients with subclinical hypothyroidism, all of whom were given thyroid replacement. All studies reported a decrease in total cholesterol (mean -7.9 mg/dL), and 9 reported a decrease in low density lipoprotein (mean -10 mg/dL)."
"How accurate is stress radionuclide imaging for diagnosis of coronary artery disease
Technical and methodological factors might affect the reported accuracies of diagnostic tests. To assess their influence on the accuracy of exercise thallium scintigraphy, the medical literature (1977 to 1986) was non-selectively searched and meta-analysis was applied to the 56 publications thus retrieved. These were analyzed for year of publication, sex and mean age of patients, percentage of patients with angina pectoris, percentage of patients with prior myocardial infarction, percentage of patients taking beta-blocking medications, and for angiographic referral (workup) bias, blinding of tests, and technical factors. The percentage of patients with myocardial infarction had the highest correlation with sensitivity (0.45, p = 0.0007). Only the inclusion of subjects with prior infarction and the percentage of men in the study group were independently and significantly (p less than 0.05) related to test sensitivity. Both the presence of workup bias and publication year adversely affected specificity (p less than 0.05). Of these two factors, publication year had the strongest association by stepwise linear regression. This analysis suggests that the reported sensitivity of thallium scintigraphy is higher and the specificity lower than that expected in clinical practice because of the presence of workup bias and the inappropriate inclusion of post-infarct patients.","Stress radionuclide imaging-specifically its diagnostic accuracy-has been the subject of numerous studies. Detrano et al reported the first pooled data (56 studies); they concluded that estimates of sensitivity (85%) and specificity (85%) are biased by studies that were not blinded, included subjects with prior myocardial infarction (MI), or had a work-up (verification) bias (ie, use of the gold standard test is affected by the result on the test under question)."
"What is the role of prokinetic agents for constipation
Previous studies with cisapride reported conflicting results in patients with constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). To gain further evidence, this randomized double-blind study was carried out. Eighty-two symptomatic outpatients were randomized to receive either 5 mg oral cisapride or placebo three times daily for a period of 12 weeks. In patients without satisfactory improvement after 4 weeks, the dose was doubled. Symptom evaluation used visual analog scales (VAS) and the investigators' global assessment. After 4 weeks, in 18 (45%) cisapride and 24 (57%) placebo patients the dose was doubled because of insufficient improvement of symptoms. The mean VAS score for patients' global rating of IBS symptoms at baseline was 67.5 mm for cisapride versus 70.7 mm for placebo, and improved to 38.4 mm versus 44.5 mm after 12 weeks of treatment. Investigators rated the overall effect of therapy as good or excellent in 70% of the cisapride and 50% of the placebo group. Neither these nor further efficacy parameter differences reached statistical significance. These results indicate that the effect of 15-30 mg cisapride daily on symptoms of constipation-predominant IBS is not significantly superior to placebo. During the 12 week treatment of this trial cisapride proved to be safe and tolerable.",Whereas another study demonstrated no significant difference between cisapride and placebo in constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome.
"Is there any benefit to Papanicolaou Pap test screening in women who have had a hysterectomy for benign disease
Periodic, routine Papanicolaou smears of cells from the vagina are commonly examined in women who have undergone a hysterectomy for benign gynecologic disease. The benefits of this method of screening are not known. We analyzed Papanicolaou smears obtained from the vaginal apex (cuff) in 6265 women at Charity Hospital in New Orleans between January 1, 1992, and December 31, 1994. Of the 10,595 vaginal smears, an estimated 9610 were obtained during follow-up examinations of 5682 women who had undergone hysterectomy for benign gynecologic disease. Among these 9610 vaginal smears, 104, from 79 women, were abnormal. The abnormal smears were categorized according to the findings, as follows: atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance, 52 (0.5 percent of all smears); low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion, 44 (0.5 percent); high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion, 6 (0.1 percent); and squamous-cell carcinoma, 2 (0.02 percent). In five women, biopsies revealed vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia type I or II; there were no biopsy-proved cases of vaginal cancer. The probability of an abnormal Papanicolaou smear in this group of women was 1.1 percent, and the positive predictive value of the Papanicolaou test for detecting vaginal cancer was 0 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 0 to 33 percent). The prevalence of abnormal findings on cytopathological examination of vaginal Papanicolaou smears after hysterectomy for benign gynecologic disease is extremely low.","In the largest cohort study, 9610 vaginal cuff Pap tests from 5682 women who had had a hysterectomy for benign disease were reviewed. The authors found 104 test results (from 79 women) were abnormal. Of these, 52 showed atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance, 44 were low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions, 6 were high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions, and 2 were read as carcinoma. Of the 79 women 27 were referred for colposcopy. Colposcopy results showed that 19 had normal mucosa, and 8 had vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia 1 or 2. Six of these cases resolved without further treatment. Two were lost to follow-up, and no cancers were diagnosed. One of the women with a Pap-based diagnosis of cancer was lost to follow-up; the other had vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia 1. No confirmed cases of carcinoma were found. The positive predictive value (the probability that an abnormal test result meant the patient had cancer) was 0% (95% confidence interval, 0.0%-33.0%)."
"Sleep apnea in adults: How accurate is clinical prediction
The Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) is a self-administered eight-item questionnaire that has been proposed as a simple method for measuring daytime sleepiness in adults. This investigation was concerned with the reliability and internal consistency of the ESS. When 87 healthy medical students were tested and retested 5 months later, their paired ESS scores did not change significantly and were highly correlated (r = 0.82). By contrast, ESS scores that were initially high in 54 patients suffering from obstructive sleep apnea syndrome returned to more normal levels, as expected, after 3-9 months' treatment with nasal continuous positive airway pressure. The questionnaire had a high level of internal consistency as measured by Cronbach's alpha (0.88). Factor analysis of item scores showed that the ESS had only one factor for 104 medical students and for 150 patients with various sleep disorders. The ESS is a simple and reliable method for measuring persistent daytime sleepiness in adults.",The Epworth Sleepiness Scale rates the likelihood of dozing in 8 situations. Factor analysis of test-retest on 104 medical students and 150 patients with various sleep disorders showed that the scale was internally consistent but measured only daytime sleepiness.
"What is the best way to evaluate and manage diarrhea in the febrile infant
This practice parameter formulates recommendations for health care providers about the management of acute diarrhea in children ages 1 month to 5 years. It was developed through a comprehensive search and analysis of the medical literature. Expert consensus opinion was used to enhance or formulate recommentations where data were insufficient. The Provisional Committee on Quality Improvement of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) selected a subcommittee composed of pediatricians with expertise in the fields of gastroenterology, infectious diseases, pediatric practice, and epidemiology to develop the parameter. The subcommittee, the Provisional Committee on Quality Improvement, a review panel of practitioners, and other groups of experts within and outside the AAP reviewed and revised the parameter. Three specific management issues were considered: (1) methods of rehydration, (2) refeeding after rehydration, and (3) the use of antidiarrheal agents. Main outcomes considered were success or failure of rehydration, resolution of diarrhea, and adverse effects from various treatment options. A comprehensive bibliography of literature on gastroenteritis and diarrhea was compiled and reduced to articles amenable to analysis. Oral rehydration therapy was studied in depth; inconsistency in the outcomes measured in the studies interfered with meta-analysis but allowed for formulation of strong conclusions. Oral rehydration was found to be as effective as intravenous therapy in rehydrating children with mild to moderate dehydration and is the therapy of first choice in these patients. Refeeding was supported by enough comparable studies to permit a valid meta-analysis. Early refeeding with milk or food after rehydration does not prolong diarrhea; there is evidence that it may reduce the duration of diarrhea by approximately half a day and is recommended to restore nutritional balance as soon as possible. Data on antidiarrheal agents were not sufficient to demonstrate efficacy; therefore, the routine use of antidiarrheal agents is not recommended, because many of these agents have potentially serious adverse effects in infants and young children. This pracrtice parameter is not indended as a sole source of guidance in the treatment of acute gastroenteritis in children. It is designed to assist pediatricians by providing an analytic framework for the evaluation and treatment of this condition. It is not intended to replace clinical judgment or to establish a protocol for all patients with this condition. It rarely will provide the only appropriate approach to the problem. A technical report describing the analyses used to prepare this parameter and a patient education brochure are available through the Publications Department of the AAP.",Infants with diarrhea who are not dehydrated should continue age-appropriate nutrition.
"Does acyclovir help herpes simplex virus cold sores if treatment is delayed
Oral valacyclovir is better absorbed than oral acyclovir, increasing acyclovir bioavailability three- to fivefold. This provides the opportunity to explore whether high systemic acyclovir concentrations are effective in the treatment of cold sores (herpes labialis). Two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies were conducted. Subjects were provided with 2 g of valacyclovir twice daily for 1 day (1-day treatment), 2 g of valacyclovir twice daily for 1 day and then 1 g of valacyclovir twice daily for 1 day (2-day treatment), or a matching placebo and instructed to initiate treatment upon the first symptoms of a cold sore. In study 1, the median duration of the episode (primary endpoint) was reduced by 1.0 day (P = 0.001) with 1-day treatment and 0.5 days (P = 0.009) with 2-day treatment compared to placebo. Similarly, the mean duration of the episode was statistically significantly reduced by 1.1 days with 1-day treatment and 0.7 days with 2-day treatment compared to placebo. The proportion of subjects in whom cold sore lesion development was prevented and/or blocked was increased by 6.4% (P = 0.096) with 1-day treatment and 8.5% (P = 0.061) with 2-day treatment compared to placebo. The time to lesion healing and time to cessation of pain and/or discomfort were statistically significantly reduced with valacyclovir compared to placebo. In study 2, results similar to those in study 1 were obtained. AEs were similar across treatment groups. These studies provide evidence supporting a simple, 1-day valacyclovir treatment regimen for cold sores that is safe and effective. The 1-day valacyclovir regimen offers patients a unique and convenient dosing alternative compared to available topical therapies.","Studies of valacyclovir (the L-valine ester of acyclovir, which has 3 to 5 times greater bioavailability) offer the most promise for effective self-initiated treatment of recurrent herpes labialis. In a report of 2 well-designed, multicenter RCTs, valacyclovir at the FDA-approved dosage of 2 g twice daily for 1 day at the onset of symptoms (before visible signs of a cold sore) significantly decreased the mean duration of the lesion and time to lesion healing. In the first study (n=603), episode duration was decreased by 1.1 days (5.0 days vs 6.1 days for placebo; 95% CI, -1.6 to -0.6) and in the second study (n=605) by 1.0 day (5.3 vs 6.3 days for placebo; 95% CI, -1.0 to -0.5). In the first study, the time to lesion healing was decreased by 1.3 days (4.8 vs 6.1 days for placebo; 95% CI, -1.9 to -0.7) and in the second study by 1.2 days (5.1 vs. 6.4 days; 95% CI, -1.8 to -0.7). There also was a trend towards preventing the development of lesions, but this was not statistically significant."
"Does glucosamine relieve arthritis joint pain
Glucosamine and chondroitin preparations are widely touted in the lay press as remedies for osteoarthritis (OA), but uncertainty about their efficacy exists among the medical community. To evaluate benefit of glucosamine and chondroitin preparations for OA symptoms using meta-analysis combined with systematic quality assessment of clinical trials of these preparations in knee and/or hip OA. We searched for human clinical trials in MEDLINE (1966 to June 1999) and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register using the terms osteoarthritis, osteoarthrosis, degenerative arthritis, glucosamine, chondroitin, and glycosaminoglycans. We also manually searched review articles, manuscripts, and supplements from rheumatology and OA journals and sought unpublished data by contacting content experts, study authors, and manufacturers of glucosamine or chondroitin. Studies were included if they were published or unpublished double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials of 4 or more weeks' duration that tested glucosamine or chondroitin for knee or hip OA and reported extractable data on the effect of treatment on symptoms. Fifteen of 37 studies were included in the analysis. Reviewers performed data extraction and scored each trial using a quality assessment instrument. We computed an effect size from the intergroup difference in mean outcome values at trial end, divided by the SD of the outcome value in the placebo group (0.2, small effect; 0.5, moderate; 0.8, large), and applied a correction factor to reduce bias. We tested for trial heterogeneity and publication bias and stratified for trial quality and size. We pooled effect sizes using a random effects model. Quality scores ranged from 12.3% to 55.4% of the maximum, with a mean (SD) of 35.5% (12%). Only 1 study described adequate allocation concealment and 2 reported an intent-to-treat analysis. Most were supported or performed by a manufacturer. Funnel plots showed significant asymmetry (P< or =.01) compatible with publication bias. Tests for heterogeneity were nonsignificant after removing 1 outlier trial. The aggregated effect sizes were 0.44 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.24-0.64) for glucosamine and 0.78 (95% CI, 0.60-0.95) for chondroitin, but they were diminished when only high-quality or large trials were considered. The effect sizes were relatively consistent for pain and functional outcomes. Trials of glucosamine and chondroitin preparations for OA symptoms demonstrate moderate to large effects, but quality issues and likely publication bias suggest that these effects are exaggerated. Nevertheless, some degree of efficacy appears probable for these preparations.","Those problems account for the relatively low quality scores of the studies used in meta-analyses, particularly in earlier ones. Quality scores range from 12% to 52% of optimal and make any definitive conclusions suspect. The magnitude of the treatment effect is variable. Meta-analyses demonstrate aggregate treatment effects ranging from 0.36 to 1.02- where a small effect is 0.2, a moderate effect is 0.5, and a large effect is 0.8."
"What is the best approach to a solitary pulmonary nodule identified by chest x-ray
This study was designed to assess the ability of radiologists to accurately detect calcification within a solitary pulmonary nodule with chest radiography. Thirty-five solitary pulmonary nodules that were examined by both posteroanterior and lateral chest radiography and on thin-section CT were retrospectively identified. Fourteen radiologists blinded to the results of CT assessed the nodules for the presence or absence of calcification using chest radiographs alone. The radiologists then assigned one of six values on the basis of their confidence in that assessment. The accuracy and confidence values for each nodule were analyzed on the basis of the presence or absence of calcification as seen on CT. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated. The positive predictive value of a ""definitely calcified"" assessment was 0.93. Combining all levels of radiologists' confidence, the sensitivity of the chest radiograph in the detection of calcium was 0.50 and the specificity was 0.87. There was no difference in the confidence levels reported between the calcified and noncalcified nodules, and there was no correlation of nodule size with accuracy or confidence level. The ability of radiologists to detect calcium in a solitary pulmonary nodule by chest radiography was low, as defined by the ROC data. Of the ""definitely calcified"" nodules, up to 7% may not be calcified and may be potentially malignant. Without documentation of long-term stability, a low threshold for recommending CT may be appropriate.","Also, a study assessing the accuracy of radiologists' assessment of calcification in solitary pulmonary nodules compared with thin-section computerized tomography found that 7% of ""definitely calcified"" nodules on chest radiograph lacked calcification on thin-section CT."
"What is the role of herpes virus serology in sexually transmitted disease screening
To determine the risk for genital herpes and asymptomatic herpes simplex virus (HSV) shedding in late pregnancy and delivery in a population of HSV type 2 (HSV-2)-seropositive but previously asymptomatic pregnant women. A prospective inception cohort study. A total of 1355 pregnant women with no history of genital herpes referred from three private obstetrics practices between November 1985 and June 1988. Confidential questionnaires evaluated sexual risk factors in relation to HSV-2 serologic status as determined by Western blot analysis. Herpes simplex virus shedding was determined by viral culture of the cervix and vulva and of any suspicious lesions. Antibody to HSV-2 was detected in 439 of 1355 pregnant women (32%) with no history of genital herpes. Asymptomatic HSV shedding was detected in 5 of 1160 cultures (0.43%) obtained in late pregnancy and during delivery. A first episode of clinical genital herpes was recognized by 43 of 264 HSV-2-seropositive women (16%) during their pregnancy. Serologic evidence of unknown HSV-2 infection was common in pregnant women without a history of genital herpes. Asymptomatic viral shedding in these women occurred at a rate similar to that seen in women with symptomatic genital HSV-2 infection. To improve recognition of genital herpes near term, obstetricians should counsel pregnant women about the high prevalence and mild and diverse symptoms of genital HSV-2 infection.",A prospective cohort study identified seropositive pregnant women with no history of genital herpes. Forty-three of 264 (16%) of these women were able to identify and report clinical herpes simplex virus to their physician during the pregnancy.
"Is prostate-specific antigen PSA screening indicated for any subgroup of men
The American Cancer Society and other national medical organizations emphasize the need for routine screening for prostate cancer in men over the age of 50. The serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) assay is the test most commonly recommended for the purpose of screening. However, when PSA screening is examined critically from the standpoint of the principles of screening, evidence from prospective studies to support the routine use of PSA testing is lacking. Data suggest that screening often detects what may be indolent, nonaggressive prostate cancer. The treatment of such a cancer with radiation or radical prostatectomy can result in significant morbidity, including urinary incontinence and impotence, without a proven decrease in mortality. Evidence from randomized clinical trials in support of routine PSA screening is urgently needed.","Higher-risk subgroups merit special attention. Screening the 3 groups mentioned above would improve the positive predictive value of PSA, but crucial data to determine whether this will improve outcomes are lacking. Using average estimates, if 3300 African American men (aged 50 to 65 years) were screened, 100 would have cancer. After subsequent radical prostatectomy, 1 screened man would die from the procedure, 60 would become impotent, and 20 would be incontinent."
"What treatments work best for constipation in children
Constipation is extremely common in childhood and may lead to overflow soiling/encopresis. Standard treatment of the more severe case is to empty the bowels of impacted faeces by the use of oral or rectal laxatives and then maintain regular bowel movements by the continuation of osmotic and stimulant laxatives. The objective of the review was to determine the effect of stimulant laxative treatment in children with chronic constipation who may also suffer from soiling / encopresis. The Cochrane database of randomised controlled trials was searched. Additional citations were sought by hand searching of paediatric journals and from contact with known professionals in the field. All identified randomised controlled trials (RCTs) which compare the administering of stimulant laxatives to children with either placebo or alternative treatment. No trials were found that met the selection criteria. No trials were found that adequately met the selection criteria. The need exists to establish a secure footing for treatment decisions and adequately sized trials are required to provide comparative data on commonly used drugs.",A Cochrane systematic review found no RCTs of stimulant laxatives for chronic functional constipation of children and concluded that evidence concerning the efficacy of these agents is insufficient.
"What is the best diagnostic approach to postmenopausal vaginal bleeding in women taking hormone replacement therapy
Postmenopausal women should undergo endometrial assessment when bleeding occurs in the absence of replacement hormone therapy, after a 1-year regimen of continuous-combined hormone replacement therapy, or at an unexpected time during cyclic replacement therapy. Endometrial assessment can be accomplished by endometrial biopsy, transvaginal ultrasonography, or hysteroscopy. Dilation and curettage should be reserved for those rare cases when the other methods are infeasible. Each method of assessment has advantages and disadvantages, and the choice of method should be made accordingly.","Hysteroscopy is also accurate but sometimes requires paracervical and general anesthesia. It also requires additional training and equipment. Zero percent to 12% of attempts fail (failures are less common in patients taking HRT), and the false-negative rate is roughly 3%."
"What's the best way to manage athletes with amenorrhea
Women have become increasingly physically active in recent decades. While exercise provides substantial health benefits, intensive exercise is also associated with a unique set of risks for the female athlete. Hypothalamic dysfunction associated with strenuous exercise, and the resulting disturbance of GnRH pulsatility, can result in delayed menarche and disruption of menstrual cyclicity. Specific mechanisms triggering reproductive dysfunction may vary across athletic disciplines. An energy drain incurred by women whose energy expenditure exceeds dietary energy intake appears to be the primary factor effecting GnRH suppression in athletes engaged in sports emphasizing leanness; nutritional restriction may be an important causal factor in the hypoestrogenism observed in these athletes. A distinct hormonal profile characterized by hyperandrogenism rather than hypoestrogenism is associated with athletes engaged in sports emphasizing strength over leanness. Complications associated with suppression of GnRH include infertility and compromised bone density. Failure to attain peak bone mass and bone loss predispose hypoestrogenic athletes to osteopenia and osteoporosis. Metabolic aberrations associated with nutritional insult may be the primary factors effecting low bone density in hypoestrogenic athletes, thus diagnosis should include careful screening for abnormal eating behavior. Increasing caloric intake to offset high energy demand may be sufficient to reverse menstrual dysfunction and stimulate bone accretion. Treatment with exogenous estrogen may help to curb further bone loss in the hypoestrogenic amenorrheic athlete, but may not be sufficient to stimulate bone growth. Treatment aimed at correcting metabolic abnormalities may in fact prove more effective than that aimed at correcting estrogen deficiencies.","Little evidence and no specific guidelines exist to guide the clinician in evaluating and managing exercise-induced amenorrhea. All athletes with amenorrhea should have a pregnancy test, because pregnancy is the most common cause of secondary amenorrhea."
"Is combining angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors and ARBs helpful or harmful
To assess and compare the effects of candesartan or lisinopril, or both, on blood pressure and urinary albumin excretion in patients with microalbuminuria, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes. Prospective, randomised, parallel group, double blind study with four week placebo run in period and 12 weeks' monotherapy with candesartan or lisinopril followed by 12 weeks' monotherapy or combination treatment. Tertiary hospitals and primary care centres in four countries (37 centres). 199 patients aged 30-75 years. Candesartan 16 mg once daily, lisinopril 20 mg once daily. Blood pressure and urinary albumin:creatinine ratio. At 12 weeks mean (95% confidence interval) reductions in diastolic blood pressure were 9.5 mm Hg (7.7 mm Hg to 11.2 mm Hg, P<0.001) and 9.7 mm Hg (7.9 mm Hg to 11.5 mm Hg, P<0.001), respectively, and in urinary albumin:creatinine ratio were 30% (15% to 42%, P<0.001) and 46% (35% to 56%, P<0.001) for candesartan and lisinopril, respectively. At 24 weeks the mean reduction in diastolic blood pressure with combination treatment (16.3 mm Hg, 13.6 mm Hg to 18.9 mm Hg, P<0. 001) was significantly greater than that with candesartan (10.4 mm Hg, 7.7 mm Hg to 13.1 mm Hg, P<0.001) or lisinopril (mean 10.7 mm Hg, 8.0 mm Hg to 13.5 mm Hg, P<0.001). Furthermore, the reduction in urinary albumin:creatinine ratio with combination treatment (50%, 36% to 61%, P<0.001) was greater than with candesartan (24%, 0% to 43%, P=0.05) and lisinopril (39%, 20% to 54%, P<0.001). All treatments were generally well tolerated. Candesartan 16 mg once daily is as effective as lisinopril 20 mg once daily in reducing blood pressure and microalbuminuria in hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes. Combination treatment is well tolerated and more effective in reducing blood pressure.","The CALM study included 199 patients with hypertension, micro-albuminuria, and type 2 diabetes mellitus, and demonstrated significantly greater attenuation of urinary albumin/creatinine ratio and significantly improved blood pressure control with combination therapy compared with either therapy alone."
"What is the best treatment for diabetic neuropathy
Our goal was to perform a pilot study to assess the effectiveness and tolerability of a topical lidocaine patch (Lidoderm) for the treatment of peripheral neuropathic pain conditions other than postherpetic neuralgia. This was an open-label prospective study. Sixteen patients with refractory peripheral neuropathic pain conditions who had reported intolerable side effects or inadequate pain relief with antidepressant, anticonvulsant, antiarrhythmic, and opioid medications participated in this study. Diagnoses included postthoracotomy pain, stump neuroma pain, intercostal neuralgia, diabetic polyneuropathy, meralgia paresthetica, complex regional pain syndrome, radiculopathy, and postmastectomy pain. A six-item Pain Relief Scale was used (0 = worse pain, 1 = no change, 2 = slight relief, 3 = moderate relief, 4 = a lot of relief, 5 = complete relief). Moderate or better pain relief was reported by 13 of the 16 participants (81%). One patient stopped treatment after 4 days due to lack of relief. The remaining 15 patients had a mean duration of patch use of 6.2 weeks with continued relief. Only 1 patient reported a side effect, a mild skin irritation. The Lidoderm patch provided clinically meaningful pain relief in most of these refractory neuropathic pain patients without side effects. Controlled trials need to be performed to confirm these preliminary findings.",One case series has suggested that lidocaine patches are efficacious for diabetic neuropathy.
"What are the causes of elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone in a newborn
Many developed countries are reexperiencing iodine deficiency. One World Health Organization index of iodine deficiency in populations is the percentage of neonates with TSH levels greater than 5 mIU/liter 72 h after delivery. Measured TSH levels vary with methodology and are influenced by external factors including iodine exposure at time of delivery. We wished to determine whether babies delivered by cesarean section have higher levels of TSH than babies delivered vaginally because this factor could influence determination of iodine deficiency. This was a cohort study of mothers delivering at a teaching hospital in 2002-2003 and their babies. Women delivering a live infant were eligible for the study. Demographic data, mode of delivery, and subsequent routine newborn screening TSH levels were recorded. Of 2031 infants, 31.2% were delivered by cesarean section; 1864 babies were born after 37 wk, with blood samples collected by d 5 (>91% on d 3). Significant predictors of TSH concentration were the day TSH was measured and type of delivery. The distribution curve of TSH values was right shifted in infants born by cesarean section. The percentage of neonates born by cesarean with at TSH value greater than 5 was 7.1%. The figure for those born vaginally was 4.3%. Babies delivered by cesarean section are significantly more likely to have TSH levels greater than 5 mIU/liter on d 3 than those delivered vaginally. With the rise in the rate of births by cesarean, this could be an important factor in assessing population iodine deficiency using neonatal TSH levels.","In term, healthy newborns, thyroid-stimulating hormone levels normally increase to levels of 60 mU/L within 30 minutes of delivery. This is followed by a rapid decline in thyroid-stimulating hormone levels over the first 5 days of life to <10 mU/L. An Australian study found more elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone levels for samples drawn on day 2 of life compared with day 3 of life, likely reflecting normal postnatal physiology. Age-specific reference ranges are necessary for interpretation of thyroid-stimulating hormone levels during the first 5 days of life. The second or third day of life remains the optimal time for screening when appropriate reference ranges are used."
"How should you manage a depressed patient unresponsive to an SSRI
A systematic review of all studies (controlled and uncontrolled) to evaluate psychological interventions with treatment-resistant depression. A systematic search to identify studies evaluating a psychological intervention with adults with a diagnosis of major depressive disorder who had not responded to at least one course of antidepressant medication. Twelve studies met inclusion criteria, of which four were controlled and eight uncontrolled. Treatment effect sizes were computable for four studies and ranged from 1.23 to 3.10 with a number of better quality studies demonstrating some improvements in patients following a psychological intervention. Psychological treatments for depression are commonly delivered and often recommended following the failure of medication. The paucity of evidence for their effectiveness in these situations is a significant problem. There is a need for studies with a strong controlled design investigating the effectiveness of psychological treatments for patients with treatment-resistant depression.",A systematic review of psychological therapies in treatment-resistant depression found 2 controlled studies (of cognitive therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy) out of 12 total studies meeting their inclusion criteria that demonstrated improved scores on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression. Further study of these therapies was recommended.
"Heat or ice for acute ankle sprain
This study assesses recovery from ankle sprains. Thirty-seven final participants were categorized according to the severity of their injury and the use of cryotherapy (15 minutes, one to three times per day) versus heat therapy (15 minutes, one to three times per day) for a minimum of three days. Therapy commenced either less than one hour, from one to 36 hours, or greater than 36 hours after traumatic event. Sprains were graded into five categories based on severity of the injury, but only two categories, subject to conservative treatment, are considered in this study. The study showed that cryotherapy started within 36 hours after the injury was statistically more effective than heat therapy for complete and rapid recovery. Patients in a group with Grade four sprains (unable to bear weight because of pain) reached full activity in 13.2 days compared to 30.4 days in a group using cryotherapy initiated 36 hours after injury or to 33.3 days in a group using heat therapy. Therefore, early use of cryotherapy, continued with adhesive compression, is an effective treatment of ankle sprains yielding earlier complete recovery than late cryotherapy or heat therapy.",A randomized controlled trial of 60 patients with acute ankle sprains of all grades presenting to an emergency department compared cryogel plus bandaging with bandaging alone (cooling vs no cooling). This study found the mean time to recovery-defined as decreased pain-was reduced from 14.8 days to 9.7 days with constant cooling for the first 48 hours.
"What is the target for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in patients with heart disease
Drug therapy for hypercholesterolaemia has remained controversial mainly because of insufficient clinical trial evidence for improved survival. The present trial was designed to evaluate the effect of cholesterol lowering with simvastatin on mortality and morbidity in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD). 4444 patients with angina pectoris or previous myocardial infarction and serum cholesterol 5.5-8.0 mmol/L on a lipid-lowering diet were randomised to double-blind treatment with simvastatin or placebo. Over the 5.4 years median follow-up period, simvastatin produced mean changes in total cholesterol, low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol, and high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol of -25%, -35%, and +8%, respectively, with few adverse effects. 256 patients (12%) in the placebo group died, compared with 182 (8%) in the simvastatin group. The relative risk of death in the simvastatin group was 0.70 (95% CI 0.58-0.85, p = 0.0003). The 6-year probabilities of survival in the placebo and simvastatin groups were 87.6% and 91.3%, respectively. There were 189 coronary deaths in the placebo group and 111 in the simvastatin group (relative risk 0.58, 95% CI 0.46-0.73), while noncardiovascular causes accounted for 49 and 46 deaths, respectively. 622 patients (28%) in the placebo group and 431 (19%) in the simvastatin group had one or more major coronary events. The relative risk was 0.66 (95% CI 0.59-0.75, p < 0.00001), and the respective probabilities of escaping such events were 70.5% and 79.6%. This risk was also significantly reduced in subgroups consisting of women and patients of both sexes aged 60 or more. Other benefits of treatment included a 37% reduction (p < 0.00001) in the risk of undergoing myocardial revascularisation procedures. This study shows that long-term treatment with simvastatin is safe and improves survival in CHD patients.",The Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival study used simvastatin 20 mg daily unless total cholesterol levels did not decrease to less than 200 mg/dL.
"Do statins cause myopathy
In the Expanded Clinical Evaluation of Lovastatin (EXCEL) Study, a multicenter, double-blind, diet- and placebo-controlled trial, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of lovastatin in 8245 patients with moderate hypercholesterolemia. Patients were randomly assigned to receive placebo or lovastatin at a dosage of 20 mg once daily, 40 mg once daily, 20 mg twice daily, or 40 mg twice daily for 48 weeks. Lovastatin produced sustained, dose-related (P less than .001) changes as follows (for dosages of 20 to 80 mg/d): decreased low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol level (24% to 40%), increased high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol level (6.6% to 9.5%), decreased total cholesterol level (17% to 29%), and decreased triglyceride level (10% to 19%). The National Cholesterol Education Program's low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol level goal of less than 4.14 mmol/L (160 mg/dL) was achieved by 80% to 96% of patients, while the less than 3.36 mmol/L (130 mg/dL) goal was achieved by 38% to 83% of patients. The difference between lovastatin and placebo in the incidence of clinical adverse experiences requiring discontinuation was small, ranging from 1.2% at 20 mg twice daily to 1.9% at 80 mg/d. Successive transaminase level elevations greater than three times the upper limit of normal were observed in 0.1% of patients receiving placebo and 20 mg/d of lovastatin, increasing to 0.9% in those receiving 40 mg/d and 1.5% in those receiving 80 mg/d of lovastatin (P less than .001 for trend). Myopathy, defined as muscle symptoms with a creatine kinase elevation greater than 10 times the upper limit of normal, was found in only one patient (0.1%) receiving 40 mg once daily and four patients (0.2%) receiving 80 mg/d of lovastatin. Thus, lovastatin, when added after an adequate trial of a prudent diet, is a highly effective and generally well-tolerated treatment for patients with moderate hypercholesterolemia.","The EXCEL trial (n=8245) of various lovastatin dosages included routine creatine kinase tests every 6 weeks for 48 weeks. Five lovastatin patients had muscle symptoms with creatine kinases >10 times the upper limits of normal, and in the 2 who continued treatment, symptoms and creatine kinase became normal. Of note, creatine kinase elevation of any kind at least once during 48 weeks occurred in 28.9% of placebo patients, arguing against routine creatine kinase screening in statin patients."
"What is the best therapy for superficial thrombophlebitis
Forty patients with superficial vein thrombosis (SVT) or thrombophlebitis were randomly treated either with defibrotide (20) an antithrombotic/profibrinolytic drug or with low-dose subcutaneous heparin [LDSH] (20) for 3 weeks. The efficacy of the two treatments was evaluated by means of computerized thermography monitoring the decrease of the areas at maximum temperature (AMT) and using an analogue scale line to evaluate signs and symptoms. Defibrotide was found to be significantly more effective than LDSH in decreasing both AMT and analogue score after 2 and 3 weeks. By enhancing endogenous fibrinolysis, defibrotide reduced the deposition of fibrin, the ensuing inflammatory response and the production of new thrombi in the affected veins. This was shown by the progressive decrease in the hyperthermic areas. Thanks to its activity defibrotide may be able to promote a faster removal of thrombi and reduce the continuous formation of new thrombi in the inflamed veins.","In a small randomized trial (n=40), intramuscular defibrotide provided better symptom resolution than low-dose heparin for patients with uncomplicated superficial venous thrombophlebitis of the leg."
"When is it OK for children to start drinking fruit juice
To describe transitions and patterns in infants' and toddlers' beverage intakes, with focus on nonmilk beverages. A cross-sectional study was conducted by telephone to obtain a 24-hour dietary recall of infants' and toddlers' food intakes, as reported by mothers or other primary caregivers. A nationwide sample of infants and toddlers (n=3,022) ages 4 to 24 months, who participated in the Feeding Infants and Toddlers Study (FITS). Beverages were categorized as total milks (ie, breast milk, infant formulas, cow's milk, soy milk, goat's milk), 100% juices, fruit drinks, carbonated beverages, water, and ""other."" Analyses included means +/- standard deviations, percentages, frequencies, nutrient densities, and linear regression. Beverages provided 84% of total daily food energy for infants 4 to 6 months of age, decreasing to 36% at ages 19 to 24 months. Apple juice and apple-flavored fruit drinks were the most frequently consumed beverages in the 100% juice and fruit drink categories, respectively. Juices, fruit drinks, and carbonated beverages appeared to displace milk in toddlers' diets (P<.0001). This research shows that beverages make important contributions to infants' and toddlers' energy and nutrient needs, but they must be wisely chosen. Registered dietitians should advise parents and caregivers that excessive intakes of any beverage, including milks and 100% juices, may displace other foods and beverages in the diet and/or contribute to excess food energy (kcal). Further research is needed to define excessive amounts in each beverage category, and such guidance could be very useful to parents and caregivers of infants and toddlers.","During the transition to table foods between 4 and 11 months of age, the top 3 nonmilk sources of carbohydrate in an infant's diet are infant cereal, 100% juice, and bananas."
"What best prevents exerciseinduced bronchoconstriction for a child with asthma
This review assesses the evidence on the efficacy of leukotriene antagonists in the management of exercise-induced bronchospasm (EIB) in children. Only two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover studies have examined the effect of leukotriene antagonists in EIB in a pediatric setting. All other studies, including those comparing leukotriene antagonists with other agents such as beta(2)-adrenoceptor agonists (beta(2)-agonists) and inhaled corticosteroids, primarily involve adult patients. In children, not receiving other asthma medication, leukotriene antagonists can offer statistically significant protection from EIB compared with placebo. However, protection is not complete, as a significant proportion of children will continue to experience a >15% reduction in FEV(1). None of the studies involved children treated concurrently with other asthma medications; therefore, comments on additive therapy cannot be made. Despite evidence from only a few studies, leukotriene antagonists are seen to be well tolerated, efficacious, and of benefit to some children. In addition, current management for EIB with short-acting beta(2)-agonists is less than ideal. It is therefore concluded that in children with EIB, leukotriene antagonists are indicated on a trial basis with individualized therapy and follow-up to evaluate treatment response.",Leukotriene antagonists have been recommended on a trial basis with follow-up to evaluate the treatment response.
"Are tympanostomy tubes indicated for recurrent acute otitis media
To estimate the incidence of tympanostomy tube sequelae based on systematic review of published case series and randomized studies. English-language MEDLINE search from 1966 through April 1999 with manual reference search of proceedings, articles, reports, and guidelines. Cohort studies with otitis media as the primary indication for tube placement. Two reviewers independently extracted data from 134 articles. Transient otorrhea occurred in 16% of patients in the postoperative period and later in 26%; recurrent otorrhea occurred in 7.4% of patients and chronic otorrhea in 3.8%. Sequelae of indwelling tubes included obstruction (7% of ears), granulation tissue (5%), premature extrusion (3.9%), and medial displacement (0.5%). Sequelae after tube extrusion included tympanosclerosis (32%), focal atrophy (25%), retraction pocket (3.1%), cholesteatoma (0.7%), and perforation (2.2% with short-term tubes, 16.6% with long-term tubes). Meta-analysis showed that long-term tubes increased the relative risk of perforation by 3.5 (95% CI, 1.5 to 7.1) and cholesteatoma by 2.6 (95% CI, 1.5 to 4.4). Similarly, intubation increased the relative risk of tympanosclerosis by 3.5 (95% CI, 2.6 to 4.9) and focal atrophy by 1.7 (95% CI, 1.1 to 2.7) over nonintubated control ears (baseline tympanosclerosis and atrophy rates of 10% and 14%, respectively). Sequelae of tympanostomy tubes are common but are generally transient (otorrhea) or cosmetic (tympanosclerosis, focal atrophy). Nonetheless, the high incidence suggests a need for ongoing otologic surveillance of all patients with indwelling tubes and for a reasonable time period after tube extrusion. Long-term tubes should be used on a selective and individualized basis.","Compared with nonsurgical treatment, complication rates for tube placement were reported in 0.7% of surgically treated ears. Complications included: tympanosclerosis (relative risk [RR]=3.5 [95% CI, 2.6-4.9]), focal atrophy (RR=1.7 [95% CI, 1.1-2.7]), perforation (RR=3.5 [95% CI, 1.5-7.1]) (2% with short-term tubes and 16% with long-term tubes), and cholesteatoma (RR=2.6 [95% CI, 1.5-4.4])."
"What is a reasonable initial approach to the patient with fatigue
To evaluate the usefulness of case-finding instruments for identifying patients with major depression in primary care settings. A MEDLINE search of the English-language medical literature; bibliographies of selected papers; and experts. Studies that were done in primary care settings with unselected patients and that compared case-finding instruments with accepted diagnostic criterion standards for major depression were selected. 9 case-finding instruments were assessed in 18 studies. More than 15,000 patients received screening with a case-finding instrument; approximately 5300 of these received criterion standard assessment. Case-finding instruments ranged in length from 2 to 28 questions. Average administration times ranged from less than 2 minutes to 6 minutes. Sensitivities and specificities for detecting major depression ranged from 67% to 99% and from 40% to 95%, respectively. No significant differences between instruments were found. Overall sensitivity was 84% (95% CI, 79% to 89%); overall specificity was 72% (CI, 67% to 77%). If a case-finding instrument were administered to 100 primary care patients with a 5% prevalence of major depression, the clinician could expect that 31 patients would screen positive, that 4 of the 31 would have major depression, and that 1 patient with major depression would not be identified. Several instruments with reasonable operating characteristics are available to help primary care clinicians identify patients with major depression. Because the operating characteristics of these instruments are similar, selection of a particular instrument should depend on issues such as feasibility, administration and scoring times, and the instruments' ability to serve additional purposes, such as monitoring severity or response to therapy.","A systematic review of case-finding instruments for depression in primary care found that most instruments are similar in accuracy (84% sensitive, 72% specific). If applied to a group of fatigued patients with a 25% probability of depression, 50% of patients with an abnormal result on one of these case-finding instruments would be depressed compared with only 7% who had a normal or negative result."
"What is the best management for patients with evidence of asymptomatic ischemia on exercise stress testing
Both attenuated heart rate recovery following exercise and the Duke treadmill exercise score have been demonstrated to be independent predictors of mortality, but their prognostic value relative to each other has not been studied. To assess the associations among abnormal heart rate recovery, treadmill exercise score, and death in patients referred specifically for exercise electrocardiography. Prospective cohort study conducted in an academic medical center between September 1990 and December 1997, with a median follow-up of 5.2 years. A total of 9454 consecutive patients (mean [SD] age, 53 [11] years; 78% male) who underwent symptom-limited exercise electrocardiographic testing. Exclusion criteria included age younger than 30 years, history of heart failure or valvular disease, pacemaker implantation, and uninterpretable electrocardiograms. All-cause mortality, as predicted by abnormal heart rate recovery, defined as failure of heart rate to decrease by more than 12/min during the first minute after peak exercise, and by treadmill exercise score, defined as (exercise time) - (5 x maximum ST-segment deviation) - (4 x treadmill angina index). Three hundred twelve deaths occurred in the cohort. Abnormal heart rate recovery and intermediate- or high-risk treadmill exercise score were present in 20% (n = 1852) and 21% (n = 1996) of patients, respectively. In univariate analyses, death was predicted by both abnormal heart rate recovery (8% vs 2% in patients with normal heart rate recovery; hazard ratio [HR], 4.16; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.33-5.19; chi(2) = 158; P<.001) and intermediate- or high-risk treadmill exercise score (8% vs 2% in patients with low-risk scores; HR, 4.28; 95% CI, 3.43-5.35; chi(2) = 164; P<.001). After adjusting for age, sex, standard cardiovascular risk factors, medication use, and other potential confounders, abnormal heart rate recovery remained predictive of death (among the 8549 patients not taking beta-blockers, adjusted HR, 2.13; 95% CI, 1.63-2.78; P<.001), as did intermediate- or high-risk treadmill exercise score (adjusted HR, 1. 49; 95% CI, 1.15-1.92; P =.002). There was no interaction between these 2 predictors. In this cohort of patients referred specifically for exercise electrocardiography, both abnormal heart rate recovery and treadmill exercise score were independent predictors of mortality. Heart rate recovery appears to provide additional prognostic information to the established treadmill exercise score and should be considered for routine incorporation into exercise test interpretation. JAMA. 2000;284:1392-1398.","A prospective cohort study confirmed that a low-risk duke treadmill exercise score was associated with high 5-year survival. Those with an intermediate- or high-risk duke treadmill exercise score had corresponding survival rates of 90% and 65%, respectively. The duke treadmill exercise score was further analyzed in a 5-year follow-up of 9454 patients, 88% of whom were low-risk (75% undergoing screening EST). Most patients (1406 of 1477) with ST-segment depression ≥1 mm had asymptomatic ischemia, only 71 having EST-induced angina. A low-risk duke treadmill exercise score was associated with 98% survival, compared with 92% for patients with an intermediate- or high-risk DTS."
"Should we screen women for hypothyroidism
The prevalence of thyroid disease and the concentration of thyroid hormones and thyrotropin were studied in a random population sample of 1154 women, aged 50-72 years, with special reference to the effect of age and smoking. The prevalence of spontaneous hypothyroidism was 3.3% (previously unknown overt and mild disease 1.3%) and the prevalence of hyperthyroidism was 2.5% (previously unknown disease 0.2%). Clinically suspected hyper- or hypothyroidism (very weak to strong) was recorded in 288 women, but was only verified in three cases. The prevalence of visible and palpable thyroid enlargement was 2.1% and 13-14%, respectively. Total thyroxine concentrations increased and free tri-iodothyronine levels decreased significantly with age (P less than 0.001). The serum thyrotropin concentrations were lower in smoking women than in non-smokers in the 50- and 58-year age groups (P less than 0.05). There was no increase in the prevalence of thyroid disease or goitre in the women who were smokers at the time of the study.","A cohort study evaluated 1154 women (aged 50-72) in a primary care setting using both history and physical and thyroid-stimulating hormone testing. thyroid-stimulating hormone testing found 3 women with overt hypothyroidism not identified by history and physical. History and physical identified 286 women with indications for thyroid-stimulating hormone testing, 2 of whom had mild hypothyroidism and 1 with mild hyperthyroidism."
"Is the ThinPrep better than conventional Pap smear at detecting cervical cancer
The goal of this study was to evaluate the performance of ThinPrep, a liquid-based cytology preparation technique, in comparison with conventionally prepared Papanicolaou smears in detecting cervical pathology. Forty-seven English-language articles published between January 1990 and September 2002 were identified through Medline and manual searches. After elimination of 5 nonprimary articles, 10 unpaired studies, 5 descriptive articles with insufficient or no data, and 3 articles with data that could not be recast into a consistent format, there remained 24 usable articles. Seventeen articles contained data comparing ThinPrep with conventional cytology for 35172 patients; and 10 articles compared cytology with histology or other gold standard diagnoses for 21752 patients. Three of these articles contained both types of comparisons. The standard cytology classification into negative, atypical, low-grade (LGSIL) and high-grade (HGSIL) squamous intraepithelial lesions, and carcinoma was applied; other categorization schemes were recoded as necessary. Concordance estimates, based on five-way and dichotomous (normal/abnormal) classifications, were obtained from the 17 studies containing paired cytology data. Sensitivity and specificity rates were obtained from the 10 studies with paired cytology and histology data. The two methods tend to agree in 89 and 92% of cases based on the five-level and dichotomous classifications, respectively. ThinPrep was reported as normal in 93.5% of cases of normal conventional smears. The remaining 6.5% of ThinPrep slides were classified as follows: atypical, 4.55%; LGSIL, 1.56%; HGSIL, 0.36%; invasive cancer, 0.007%. Sensitivity rates, relative to histology, were 68% (conventional) and 76% (ThinPrep), and specificity rates were 79% (conventional) and 86% (ThinPrep). ThinPrep tends to be more sensitive and specific than conventional smears in detecting cervical dysplasia. The increased sensitivity of ThinPrep results in increased cytologic diagnosis of cervical atypia, LGSIL, HGSIL, and invasive cervical carcinoma.","A recent quantitative review implies that the ThinPrep increases cytologic diagnoses of cervical cancer and its precursors. A strength of this review is the inclusion of 10 articles with histology as the reference standard. The data from 21,752 patients compared the sensitivity and specificity rates of Thin Prep with conventional Pap for detecting abnormal histology. Sensitivity rates were reported as 76% (ThinPrep) and 68% (conventional), but the differences met statistical significance in only 2 of the included studies. Similarly, the overall specificity rates of the ThinPrep vs conventional Pap was 86% vs 79%, and again the differences did not usually reach statistical significance. The authors hypothesize that widespread use of ThinPrep could potentially detect an additional 162,000 patients with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion and 3000 patients with invasive cervical carcinoma."
"What medication best prevents migraine in children
Migraine is a cause of recurrent headache in childhood. The efficacy of sodium valproate is well known in the prophylactic treatment of adult migraine, but there are few studies involving the drug's effect in pediatric migraine. To determine the efficacy of sodium valproate in the prophylactic treatment of childhood migraine. Fifteen children with migraine according to International Headache Society criteria were included in the study. Headache severity was measured and assessed by Algology unit by a using visual analog scale and a numerical rating scale. All of the subjects were asked to keep a headache diary for 8 weeks. Three subjects who had no headache attacks during the baseline period and two cases who were lost to follow up were excluded. Thus, sodium valproate was initiated in 10 subjects (six boys, four girls), 500 mg/night, and the daily dose was increased up to 1000 mg according to blood levels. Their ages ranged from 9 to 17 (mean age 13.6 +/- 3.2 years). Therapy continued for at least 12 weeks. Headache severity as measured via the mean visual analog score was 6.8 +/- 1.8 at baseline and was 0.7 +/- 1.2 at the end of the treatment period (P = 0.000). Mean headache attacks per month were 6 +/- 4.2 at baseline and were 0.8 +/- 1.9 at the end of the treatment period (P = 0.002). The duration of headache was significantly decreased from a mean of 5.5 +/- 3.9 hours to 1.1 +/- 2.5 hours with treatment (P = 0.001). The observed side effects were dizziness, drowsiness, and increase in appetite; none required drug withdrawal. In two cases, headache attacks recurred after the cessation of valproate, and therapy was restarted. Headache control lasted for six months following cessation of the drug in the remainder of the subjects. Sodium valproate appears to be effective and safe in selected patients with childhood migraine.",A single uncontrolled interventional trial of valproic acid in 10 children showed a significant trend of improvement in frequency (mean of 6 attacks/month to 0.8 attacks/month) and duration (mean 5.5 hours per attack to 1.1 hour).
"What's the best way to screen for anxiety and panic disorders
Many case-finding instruments are available to help primary care physicians (PCPs) diagnose depression, but they are not widely used. Physicians often consider these instruments too time consuming or feel they do not provide sufficient diagnostic information. Our study examined the validity and utility of the Quick PsychoDiagnostics (QPD) Panel, an automated mental health test designed to meet the special needs of PCPs. The test screens for 9 common psychiatric disorders and requires no physician time to administer or score. We evaluated criterion validity relative to the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID), and evaluated convergent validity by correlating QPD Panel scores with established mental health measures. Sensitivity to change was examined by readministering the test to patients pretreatment and posttreatment. Utility was evaluated through physician and patient satisfaction surveys. For major depression, sensitivity and specificity were 81% and 96%, respectively. For other disorders, sensitivities ranged from 69% to 98%, and specificities ranged from 90% to 97%. The depression severity score correlated highly with the Beck, Hamilton, Zung, and CES-D depression scales, and the anxiety score correlated highly with the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and the anxiety subscale of the Symptom Checklist 90 (Ps <.001). The test was sensitive to change. All PCPs agreed or strongly agreed that the QPD Panel ""is convenient and easy to use,"" ""can be used immediately by any physician,"" and ""helps provide better patient care."" Patients also rated the test favorably. The QPD Panel is a valid mental health assessment tool that can diagnose a range of common psychiatric disorders and is practical for routine use in primary care.","The QPD reports an excellent positive likelihood ratio and good negative likelihood ratio for panic disorder. As mentioned above, these results are limited by the quality of its sample size and the expense."
"When should acute nonvenereal conjunctivitis be treated with topical antibiotics
The editors of this Festschrift asked us to review the use of antibiotics for the treatment of bacterial conjunctivitis and keratitis over the past 25 years, a period coinciding with the life of the Castroviejo Corneal Society. We believe it is more appropriate to begin our review in the late 1960s. about the time that experimental and clinical studies and algorithms for the clinical care derived from these studies helped shape a more rigorous approach to therapy. Those years saw the introduction of antibiotics that were adapted for ophthalmic use, many of which are still being used today. We will give more weight to our review of keratitis than conjunctivitis.",Antibiotic resistance is a growing problem. Studies of fluoroquinolone resistance rates report a range of 4% to 50% for ocular bacteria. The 50% resistance rate occurred after 4 weeks of topical treatment in postcataract surgery patients.
"How effective is desmopressin for primary nocturnal enuresis
Enuresis (bedwetting) is a socially disruptive and stressful condition which affects around 15-20% of five year olds, and up to 2% of young adults. To assess the effects of desmopressin on nocturnal enuresis in children, and to compare desmopressin with other interventions. We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group trials register. Date of the most recent search: March 2002. The reference list of a previous version of this review was also searched. All randomised trials of desmopressin for nocturnal enuresis in children were included in the review. Comparison interventions included placebo, other drugs, alarms or behavioural methods. Trials focused solely on daytime wetting were excluded. Two reviewers independently assessed the quality of the eligible trials, and extracted data. Forty one randomised trials involving 2760 children (of whom 1813 received desmopressin) met the inclusion criteria. The quality of many of the trials was poor. Desmopressin was compared with another drug in four trials, and with alarms in seven. Desmopressin was effective in reducing bedwetting in a variety of doses and forms. Each dose of desmopressin reduced bedwetting by at least one night per week during treatment compared with placebo (e.g. 20 microg: 1.34 fewer wet nights per week, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.57). Children on desmopressin were more likely to become dry (e.g. RR for failure to achieve 14 dry nights with 20 mcg 0.84, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.91). However, there was no difference after treatment was finished. There was no clear dose-related effect of desmopressin, but the evidence was limited. Data which compared oral and nasal administration were too few to be conclusive. While desmopressin was better than diclofenac or indomethacin, and comparison with tricyclic drugs (amitriptyline and imipramine) suggested that they might be as effective as desmopressin, the data were inconclusive due to small numbers. There were more side effects with the tricyclics. In one small trial, desmopressin resulted in more wet nights than alarms towards the end of treatment (WMD 1.4, 95% CI: 0.14 to 2.66) and the chance of failure or relapse after alarms was less (RR 9.17, 95% CI 1.28 to 65.90). Although there were fewer wet nights during alarm treatment supplemented by desmopressin compared with alarms alone (WMD -1.35, 95% CI -2.32 to -0.38), the data are inconclusive about whether this is reflected in lower failure (RR 0.88, 95%CI 0.52 to 1.50) or subsequent relapse rates (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.10). Desmopressin rapidly reduced the number of wet nights per week, but there was some evidence that this was not sustained after treatment stopped. Comparison with alternative treatments suggested that desmopressin and tricyclics had similar clinical effects, but that alarms may produce more sustained benefits. However, based on the available limited evidence, these conclusions can only be tentative. Children should be advised not to drink more than 240 ml (8 oz) fluid during desmopressin treatment in order to avoid the possible risk of water intoxication.","One randomized controlled trial found a linear dose response for oral desmopressin in reducing wet nights. After 2 weeks of treatment, the number of wet nights was decreased by 27%, 30%, and 40% at doses of 0.2 mg, 0.4 mg, and 0.6 mg, respectively, compared with 10% with placebo."
"Is neurosurgery referral warranted for small brain aneurysms
The management of unruptured intracranial aneurysms requires knowledge of the natural history of these lesions and the risks of repairing them. A total of 2621 patients at 53 participating centers in the United States, Canada, and Europe were enrolled in the study, which had retrospective and prospective components. In the retrospective component, we assessed the natural history of unruptured intracranial aneurysms in 1449 patients with 1937 unruptured intracranial aneurysms; 727 of the patients had no history of subarachnoid hemorrhage from a different aneurysm (group 1), and 722 had a history of subarachnoid hemorrhage from a different aneurysm that had been repaired successfully (group 2). In the prospective component, we assessed treatment-related morbidity and mortality in 1172 patients with newly diagnosed unruptured intracranial aneurysms. In group 1, the cumulative rate of rupture of aneurysms that were less than 10 mm in diameter at diagnosis was less than 0.05 percent per year, and in group 2, the rate was approximately 11 times as high (0.5 percent per year). The rupture rate of aneurysms that were 10 mm or more in diameter was less than 1 percent per year in both groups, but in group 1, the rate was 6 percent the first year for giant aneurysms (> or =25 mm in diameter). The size and location of the aneurysm were independent predictors of rupture. The overall rate of surgery-related morbidity and mortality was 17.5 percent in group 1 and 13.6 percent in group 2 at 30 days and was 15.7 percent and 13.1 percent, respectively, at 1 year. Age independently predicted surgical outcome. The likelihood of rupture of unruptured intracranial aneurysms that were less than 10 mm in diameter was exceedingly low among patients in group 1 and was substantially higher among those in group 2. The risk of morbidity and mortality related to surgery greatly exceeded the 7.5-year risk of rupture among patients in group 1 with unruptured intracranial aneurysms smaller than 10 mm in diameter.","In the largest cohort study to date, patients without a history of subarachnoid hemorrhage had an overall risk of rupture of 0.05% per year over 7.5 years. This study also found that surgery-related morbidity and mortality at 1 year among patients aged <45 years was 6.5%, compared with 14.4% for those aged 45 to 64 years, and 32% for those aged >64 years."
"Does neonatal circumcision decrease morbidity
To systematically review studies of male circumcision and the risk of HIV-1 infection in men in sub-Saharan Africa, and to summarize the findings in a meta-analysis. A meta-analysis of observational studies. A systematic literature review was carried out of studies published up to April 1999 that included circumcision as a risk factor for HIV-1 infection among men in sub-Saharan Africa. A random effects meta-analysis was used to calculate a pooled relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for all studies combined, and stratified by type of study population. Further analyses were conducted among those studies that adjusted for potential confounding factors. Twenty-seven studies were included. Of these, 21 showed a reduced risk of HIV among circumcised men, being approximately half that in uncircumcised men (crude RR = 0.52, CI 0.40-0.68). In 15 studies that adjusted for potential confounding factors, the association was even stronger (adjusted RR = 0.42, CI 0.34-0.54). The association was stronger among men at high risk of HIV (crude RR = 0.27; adjusted RR = 0.29, CI 0.20-0.41) than among men in general populations (crude RR = 0.93; adjusted RR = 0.56, CI 0.44-0.70). Male circumcision is associated with a significantly reduced risk of HIV infection among men in sub-Saharan Africa, particularly those at high risk of HIV. These results suggest that consideration should be given to the acceptability and feasibility of providing safe services for male circumcision as an additional HIV prevention strategy in areas of Africa where men are not traditionally circumcised.",A conservative estimate of the post-neonatal childhood circumcision rate for purely medical reasons is 2% to 5%; estimates go as high as 7% to 10%.
"How reliable are self-measured blood pressures taken at home
The widespread clinical use of self-recorded blood pressure measurement is limited by the lack of generally accepted reference values. The purpose of this study was therefore to perform a meta-analysis of summary data in an attempt to determine an operational threshold for self-recorded blood pressures. STUDIES AND METHODS: Seventeen studies, including a total of 5422 subjects, were reviewed. Eight of these 17 studies included both normotensive and untreated hypertensive subjects, while the other 9 reports included normotensive subjects only. Within each study an operational cutoff point between normotension and hypertension was derived by means of the mean+2 SDs and the 95th percentiles of the self-recorded blood pressure in normotensive subjects. These 2 methods were contrasted with 2 other techniques that have been applied in the literature to calculate (1) the self-recorded pressures equivalent to a conventional pressure of 140 mm Hg systolic and 90 mm Hg diastolic by means of regression analysis and (2) the self-recorded blood pressures at the percentiles corresponding to a conventional pressure of 140/90 mm Hg. The latter 2 methods were applied in untreated subjects not selected on the basis of their blood pressure. With weighting for the number of subjects included in the various studies, the self-recorded blood pressure averaged 115/71 mm Hg in normotensive persons and 119/74 mm Hg in untreated subjects not selected on the basis of their blood pressure. The reference values for self-recorded blood pressures determined by the mean+2 SDs (137/89 mm Hg) or the 95th percentile (135/86 mm Hg) of the distribution in normotensive subjects were concordant within 2/3 mm Hg, whereas the cutoff points derived with the regression and percentile methods were considerably lower, ie, 125/79 and 129/84 mm Hg, respectively. Until the relationship between self-recorded pressure and the incidence of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality is further clarified by prospective studies, a mean self-recorded blood pressure above 135 mm Hg systolic or 85 mm Hg diastolic may be considered hypertensive.",The correlation between office blood pressure and self measured blood pressure can be derived via three different mathematical models using data from multiple studies. The accepted cutoff for self measured blood pressure defined hypertension is 135/85 mm Hg.
"Does treatment of acne with Retin A and tetracycline cause adverse effects
Because minocycline can cause serious adverse events including hypersensitivity syndrome reaction (HSR), serum sicknesslike reaction (SSLR), and drug-induced lupus, a follow-up study based on a retrospective review of our Drug Safety Clinic and the Health Protection Branch databases and a literature review was conducted to determine if similar rare events are associated with tetracycline and doxycycline. Cases of isolated single organ dysfunction (SOD) attributable to the use of these antibiotics also were identified. Nineteen cases of HSR due to minocycline, 2 due to tetracycline, and 1 due to doxycycline were identified. Eleven cases of SSLR due to minocycline, 3 due to tetracycline, and 2 due to doxycycline were identified. All 33 cases of drug-induced lupus were attributable to minocycline. Forty cases of SOD from minocycline, 37 cases from tetracycline, and 6 from doxycycline were detected. Hypersensitivity syndrome reaction, SSLR, and SOD occur on average within 4 weeks of therapy, whereas minocycline-induced lupus occurs on average 2 years after the initiation of therapy. Early serious events occurring during the course of tetracycline antibiotic treatment include HSR, SSLR, and SOD. Drug-induced lupus, which occurs late in the course of therapy, is reported only with minocycline. We theorize that minocycline metabolism may account for the increased frequency of serious adverse events with this drug.","A study of the safety of tetracycline, which used reports in a drug safety database and a literature review of reported adverse events, concluded that rare but serious events do occur with tetracycline. Severe cutaneous adverse reaction was the most common reported single-organ dysfunction. Other rare events included hypersensitivity syndrome reactions and serum sickness-like reactions. Since baseline rates of tetracycline use are unknown, it is impossible to ascertain the event rates for these rare reactions. Most of these serious adverse events occur less than 2 months after initiating therapy; they typically include general symptoms such as fever, malaise, and arthralgias, but may also include major organ involvement. The study suggested no clear treatment for these complications, but recommended discontinuing tetracycline and avoiding the entire tetracycline class of drugs. No evidence supports previous concerns that tetracycline causes drug-induced lupus."
"When is it OK for children to start drinking fruit juice
Consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs), particularly carbonated soft drinks, may be a key contributor to the epidemic of overweight and obesity, by virtue of these beverages' high added sugar content, low satiety, and incomplete compensation for total energy. Whether an association exists between SSB intake and weight gain is unclear. We searched English-language MEDLINE publications from 1966 through May 2005 for cross-sectional, prospective cohort, and experimental studies of the relation between SSBs and the risk of weight gain (ie, overweight, obesity, or both). Thirty publications (15 cross-sectional, 10 prospective, and 5 experimental) were selected on the basis of relevance and quality of design and methods. Findings from large cross-sectional studies, in conjunction with those from well-powered prospective cohort studies with long periods of follow-up, show a positive association between greater intakes of SSBs and weight gain and obesity in both children and adults. Findings from short-term feeding trials in adults also support an induction of positive energy balance and weight gain by intake of sugar-sweetened sodas, but these trials are few. A school-based intervention found significantly less soft-drink consumption and prevalence of obese and overweight children in the intervention group than in control subjects after 12 mo, and a recent 25-week randomized controlled trial in adolescents found further evidence linking SSB intake to body weight. The weight of epidemiologic and experimental evidence indicates that a greater consumption of SSBs is associated with weight gain and obesity. Although more research is needed, sufficient evidence exists for public health strategies to discourage consumption of sugary drinks as part of a healthy lifestyle.","A recent systematic review of 30 studies (15 cross-sectional, 10 prospective cohort, and 5 experimental trials) supports a link between consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages and childhood obesity."
"Does microalbuminuria screening in diabetes prevent complications
Our goal was to evaluate whether screening patients with diabetes for microalbuminuria (MA) is effective according to the criteria developed by Frame and Carlson and those of the US Preventive Services Task Force. We searched the MEDLINE database (1966-present) and bibliographies of relevant articles. We evaluated the impact of MA screening using published criteria for periodic health screening tests. The effect of the correlation between repeated tests on the accuracy of a currently recommended testing strategy was analyzed. Quantitative tests have reported sensitivities from 56% to 100% and specificities from 81% to 98%. Semiquantitative tests for MA have reported sensitivities from 51% to 100% and specificities from 21% to 100%. First morning, morning, or random urine sampling appear feasible. Assuming an individual test sensitivity of 90%, a specificity of 90%, and a 10% prevalence of MA, the correlation between tests would have to be lower than 0.1 to achieve a positive predictive value for repeated testing of 75%. Screening for MA meets only 4 of 6 Frame and Carlson criteria for evaluating screening tests. The recommended strategies to overcome diagnostic uncertainty by using repeated testing are based on expert opinion, are difficult to follow in primary care settings, do not improve diagnostic accuracy sufficiently, and have not been tested in a controlled trial. Although not advocated by the American Diabetes Association, semiquantitative MA screening tests using random urine sampling have acceptable accuracy but may not be reliable in all settings.",No prospective randomized trials of screening have been reported. There is uncertainty about what method of screening is most effective and practical in primary care settings.
"Which strategies work best to prevent obesity in adults
This paper is a systematic review of research data on associations between physical activity and weight gain, with or without prior weight reduction. The selected studies were restricted to Caucasian (white) adults. Most studies with data on physical activity collected at follow-up, found an inverse association between physical activity and long-term weight gain. This finding was present in studies both with and without prior weight reduction. Prospective studies with physical activity measured at baseline, and randomized weight reduction interventions, gave inconsistent results regarding the effects of increased physical activity on weight change. The weighted mean weight regain in randomized studies with or without exercise training was 0.28 and 0.33 kg/month, respectively. Based on observational studies, it seemed that an actual increase in energy expenditure of physical activity of approximately 6300-8400 kJ/week (1500-2000 kcal/week) is associated with improved weight maintenance. This is more than was prescribed in most randomized trials, and certainly more than the participants actually achieved. Adherence to a prescribed exercise programme remains a big challenge. Before new methods to improve exercise adherence are found, the role of prescribed physical activity in prevention of weight gain remains modest.","A systematic review of the effects of physical activity on weight reduction and maintenance analyzed 46 studies, including 8 RCTs that investigated interventions to reduce weight and 3 that examined measures to maintain it. More than 80% of the studies showed a benefit from physical exercise. Prevention of weight gain appears to be dose-dependent. More exercise leads to less weight gain; a minimum of 1.5 hours per week of moderate exercise is needed to prevent weight gain."
"Should we screen women for hypothyroidism
To determine if health-related quality of life (HRQL) in patients of middle age and older with elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and normal total thyroid hormone levels-subclinical hypothyroidism-improves with L-thyroxine replacement therapy. Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Outpatient clinic. Thirty-seven patients with subclinical hypothyroidism, most with symptoms consistent with hypothyroidism, over 55 years of age. Placebo or L-thyroxine replacement therapy to achieve normal TSH level. Disease-specific and general HRQL, cognitive function, bone mineral density, lipid levels. The mean daily dose of L-thyroxine replacement in the active group was 68 +/- 21 micrograms. TSH decreased by 8.6 mIU/L (95% confidence interval [CI] 4.1 to 13.1) and T4 increased by 27.9 nmol/L (95% CI 14.8 to 41.2). There was a statistically significant improvement in a composite psychometric memory score in treated versus control patients; all other outcomes showed similar findings in the two groups. Although confidence intervals for most measures did not exclude an important improvement in HRQL with thyroid replacement, no measure of symptoms or HRQL either showed clinically important trends in favor of treatment, or approached conventional levels of statistical significance. In middle-aged and older patients with elevated TSH and normal T4, it may not be harmful to follow biochemical and clinical status even in the presence of nonspecific symptoms potentially associated with hypothyroidism.","A randomized trial of 37 patients over 55 with subclinical hypothyroidism (28 of whom were women), found that thyroid hormone reduced bone mineral density, as assessed by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scans over a 10-month period."
"Should we screen for ovarian cancer
The objectives of the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial are to determine in screenees ages 55-74 at entry whether screening with flexible sigmoidoscopy (60-cm sigmoidoscope) can reduce mortality from colorectal cancer, whether screening with chest X-ray can reduce mortality from lung cancer, whether screening men with digital rectal examination (DRE) plus serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) can reduce mortality from prostate cancer, and whether screening women with CA125 and transvaginal ultrasound (TVU) can reduce mortality from ovarian cancer. Secondary objectives are to assess screening variables other than mortality for each of the interventions including sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value; to assess incidence, stage, and survival of cancer cases; and to investigate biologic and/or prognostic characterizations of tumor tissue and biochemical products as intermediate endpoints. The design is a multicenter, two-armed, randomized trial with 37,000 females and 37,000 males in each of the two arms. In the intervention arm, the PSA and CA125 tests are performed at entry, then annually for 5 years. The DRE, TVU, and chest X-ray exams are performed at entry and then annually for 3 years. Sigmoidoscopy is performed at entry and then at the 5-year point. Participants in the control arm follow their usual medical care practices. Participants will be followed for at least 13 years from randomization to ascertain all cancers of the prostate, lung, colorectum, and ovary, as well as deaths from all causes. A pilot phase was undertaken to assess the randomization, screening, and data collection procedures of the trial and to estimate design parameters such as compliance and contamination levels. This paper describes eligibility, consent, and other design features of the trial, randomization and screening procedures, and an outline of the follow-up procedures. Sample-size calculations are reported, and a data analysis plan is presented.","Before screening is implemented, there should be evidence that early detection and treatment of the disease results in improved outcomes. Several ongoing randomized controlled trials address screening of average-risk women, including one sponsored by the National Institutes of Health (NIH)."
"Do preparticipation clinical exams reduce morbidity and mortality for athletes
This study investigated the relationships between the findings from a standardized preparticipation athletic examination, the sport played, and athletic injuries requiring treatment by a physician and/or requiring the athlete to miss one or more games. Of public high school students receiving a preparticipation athletic examination during the 1989-1990 academic year, 674 (56%) either completed a telephone interview or returned a mailed questionnaire at the end of the academic year. The sample consisted of 408 (60.5%) blacks and 243 (36.1%) whites; 470 (69.7%) of the subjects were males. The subjects ranged in age from 13 to 20 years (mean +/- SD, 16.1 +/- 1.2 years), and participated in at least 10 school sports. Injuries were reported by 29.5% of the athletes. The highest proportion of athletes injured occurred among male football (36.3%), female basketball (33.3%), male baseball (19.4%), male soccer (17.2%), and female track and field (15.8%) participants. Responses by the athletes and their parents on the standardized health history were significantly associated with injuries in several specific areas. Knee injuries were associated with previous knee injuries, knee surgery, and history of injuries requiring medical treatment. Ankle injuries were associated with previous ankle injuries and previous injuries requiring medical treatment. Both arm and other leg injuries were associated with previous fractures. Male athletes with either abnormal knee or ankle findings from the physical examination were more likely to injure the knee or ankle, respectively. However, the sensitivities and positive predictive values of these relationships are weak. These data suggest that the preparticipation athletic examination may not predict certain athletic injuries and that additional prevention efforts for specific body areas of injury are needed in certain sports.","A study surveyed 1204 student athletes (aged 13-20 years) from Richmond County, Georgia, who had a standardized preparticipation evaluation before participating in sports. The questionnaire was administered via mail or telephone and inquired about injuries sustained after the PPE. The response rate to the survey was 56%. The study found that a history of knee or ankle injury and abnormal findings on exam in male athletes slightly increased the likelihood of repeated injury of the same joint. However, the sensitivities of history or physical exam for ankle or knee injuries were all <25%."
"Other than anticoagulation, what is the best therapy for those with atrial fibrillation
The Joint Panel of the American Academy of Family Physicians and the American College of Physicians, in collaboration with the Johns Hopkins Evidence-based Practice Center, systematically reviewed the available evidence on the management of newly detected atrial fibrillation and developed recommendations for adult patients with first-detected atrial fibrillation. The recommendations do not apply to patients with postoperative or post-myocardial infarction atrial fibrillation, patients with class IV heart failure, patients already taking antiarrhythmic drugs, or patients with valvular disease. The target physician audience is internists and family physicians dedicated to primary care. The recommendations are as follows: RECOMMENDATION 1: Rate control with chronic anticoagulation is the recommended strategy for the majority of patients with atrial fibrillation. Rhythm control has not been shown to be superior to rate control (with chronic anticoagulation) in reducing morbidity and mortality and may be inferior in some patient subgroups to rate control. Rhythm control is appropriate when based on other special considerations, such as patient symptoms, exercise tolerance, and patient preference. Grade: 2A. RECOMMENDATION 2: Patients with atrial fibrillation should receive chronic anticoagulation with adjusted-dose warfarin, unless they are at low risk of stroke or have a specific contraindication to the use of warfarin (thrombocytopenia, recent trauma or surgery, alcoholism). Grade: 1A. RECOMMENDATION 3: For patients with atrial fibrillation, the following drugs are recommended for their demonstrated efficacy in rate control during exercise and while at rest: atenolol, metoprolol, diltiazem, and verapamil (drugs listed alphabetically by class). Digoxin is only effective for rate control at rest and therefore should only be used as a second-line agent for rate control in atrial fibrillation. Grade: 1B. RECOMMENDATION 4: For those patients who elect to undergo acute cardioversion to achieve sinus rhythm in atrial fibrillation, both direct-current cardioversion (Grade: 1C+) and pharmacological conversion (Grade: 2A) are appropriate options. RECOMMENDATION 5: Both transesophageal echocardiography with short-term prior anticoagulation followed by early acute cardioversion (in the absence of intracardiac thrombus) with postcardioversion anticoagulation versus delayed cardioversion with pre- and postanticoagulation are appropriate management strategies for those patients who elect to undergo cardioversion. Grade: 2A. RECOMMENDATION 6: Most patients converted to sinus rhythm from atrial fibrillation should not be placed on rhythm maintenance therapy since the risks outweigh the benefits. In a selected group of patients whose quality of life is compromised by atrial fibrillation, the recommended pharmacologic agents for rhythm maintenance are amiodarone, disopyramide, propafenone, and sotalol (drugs listed in alphabetical order). The choice of agent predominantly depends on specific risk of side effects based on patient characteristics. Grade: 2A.",Pharmacologic conversion for patients who desire a rhythm-control strategy are described as appropriate options.
"Sleep apnea in adults: How accurate is clinical prediction
Although sleep apnea is common, it often goes undiagnosed in primary care encounters. To test the Berlin Questionnaire as a means of identifying patients with sleep apnea. Survey followed by portable, unattended sleep studies in a subset of patients. Five primary care sites in Cleveland, Ohio. 744 adults (of 1008 surveyed [74%]), of whom 100 underwent sleep studies. Survey items addressed the presence and frequency of snoring behavior, waketime sleepiness or fatigue, and history of obesity or hypertension. Patients with persistent and frequent symptoms in any two of these three domains were considered to be at high risk for sleep apnea. Portable sleep monitoring was conducted to measure the number of respiratory events per hour in bed (respiratory disturbance index [RDI]). Questions about symptoms demonstrated internal consistency (Cronbach correlations, 0.86 to 0.92). Of the 744 respondents, 279 (37.5%) were in a high-risk group that was defined a priori. For the 100 patients who underwent sleep studies, risk grouping was useful in prediction of the RDI. For example, being in the high-risk group predicted an RDI greater than 5 with a sensitivity of 0.86, a specificity of 0.77, a positive predictive value of 0.89, and a likelihood ratio of 3.79. The Berlin Questionnaire provides a means of identifying patients who are likely to have sleep apnea.","The Berlin Questionnaire assesses snoring, daytime sleepiness, history of hypertension, age, and body mass index (BMI). The questionnaire was evaluated in 744 adults presenting for unrelated problems at 5 primary care sites. Of 100 patients who underwent sleep studies, a finding of high risk on the Berlin Questionnaire predicted an apnea-hypopnea index >5 with 86% sensitivity and 77% specificity, a positive likelihood ratio of 3.79."
"What is the risk of bowel strangulation in an adult with an untreated inguinal hernia
Many patients with an inguinal hernia are asymptomatic or have little in the way of symptoms from their hernia. Repair is often associated with long-term chronic pain and has a recurrence rate of 5% to 10%. Our aim was to compare operation with a wait-and-see policy in patients with an asymptomatic hernia. A total of 160 male patients 55 years or older were randomly assigned to observation or operation. Patients were assessed clinically and sent questionnaires at 6 months and 1 year. The primary endpoint was pain and general health status at 12 months; other outcome measures included costs to the health service and the rate of operation for a new symptom or complication. At 12 months, there were no significant differences between the randomized groups of observation or operation, in visual analogue pain scores at rest, 3.7 mm versus 5.2 mm (mean difference, -1.6; 95% confidence interval (CI), -4.8 to 1.6, P = 0.34), or on moving, 7.6 mm versus 5.7 mm (mean difference, -1.9; 95% CI, -6.1 to 2.4, P = 0.39). Also, the number of patients 29 versus 24 (difference in proportion, 8%; 95% CI, -7% to 23%, P = 0.31), who recorded pain on moving and the number taking regular analgesia, 9 versus 17 (difference in proportion, -10%; 95% CI, -21% to 2%, P = 0.14) was similar. At 6 months, there were significant improvements in most of the dimensions of the SF-36 for the operation group, while at 12 months although the trend remained the same the differences were only significant for change in health (mean difference, 7.3; 95% CI, 0.4 to 14.3, P = 0.039). The rate of crossover from observation to operation 23 patients at a median follow-up of 574 days was higher than predicted. The observation group also suffered 3 serious hernia-related adverse events compared with none in the operation group. Repair of an asymptomatic inguinal hernia does not affect the rate of long-term chronic pain and may be beneficial to patients in improving overall health and reducing potentially serious morbidity.","The mean follow-up time in a trial which had 80 control group participants, was 1.6 years; 29% of patients eventually crossed over for repair."
"What is the best regimen for newly diagnosed hypertension
Establishing relative benefit or harm from specific antihypertensive agents is limited by the complex array of studies that compare treatments. Network meta-analysis combines direct and indirect evidence to better define risk or benefit. To summarize the available clinical trial evidence concerning the safety and efficacy of various antihypertensive therapies used as first-line agents and evaluated in terms of major cardiovascular disease end points and all-cause mortality. We used previous meta-analyses, MEDLINE searches, and journal reviews from January 1995 through December 2002. We identified long-term randomized controlled trials that assessed major cardiovascular disease end points as an outcome. Eligible studies included both those with placebo-treated or untreated controls and those with actively treated controls. Network meta-analysis was used to combine direct within-trial between-drug comparisons with indirect evidence from the other trials. The indirect comparisons, which preserve the within-trial randomized findings, were constructed from trials that had one treatment in common. Data were combined from 42 clinical trials that included 192 478 patients randomized to 7 major treatment strategies, including placebo. For all outcomes, low-dose diuretics were superior to placebo: coronary heart disease (CHD; RR, 0.79; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.69-0.92); congestive heart failure (CHF; RR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.42-0.62); stroke (RR, 0.71; 0.63-0.81); cardiovascular disease events (RR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.69-0.83); cardiovascular disease mortality (RR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.73-0.92); and total mortality (RR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.84-0.96). None of the first-line treatment strategies-beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, calcium channel blockers (CCBs), alpha-blockers, and angiotensin receptor blockers-was significantly better than low-dose diuretics for any outcome. Compared with CCBs, low-dose diuretics were associated with reduced risks of cardiovascular disease events (RR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.89-1.00) and CHF (RR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.67-0.81). Compared with ACE inhibitors, low-dose diuretics were associated with reduced risks of CHF (RR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.80-0.96), cardiovascular disease events (RR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.89-1.00), and stroke (RR, 0.86; 0.77-0.97). Compared with beta-blockers, low-dose diuretics were associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease events (RR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.80-0.98). Compared with alpha-blockers, low-dose diuretics were associated with reduced risks of CHF (RR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.43-0.60) and cardiovascular disease events (RR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.75-0.93). Blood pressure changes were similar between comparison treatments. Low-dose diuretics are the most effective first-line treatment for preventing the occurrence of cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality. Clinical practice and treatment guidelines should reflect this evidence, and future trials should use low-dose diuretics as the standard for clinically useful comparisons.","Several other clinical trials have subsequently compared the effect of thiazide diuretics with that of other antihypertensive agents (beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and alpha-blockers) on patient-oriented outcomes. These were analyzed in a recent meta-analysis of 42 clinical trials that included 192,478 patients randomized to 7 treatment strategies including placebo."
"What is the differential diagnosis of chronic diarrhea in immunocompetent patients
The utility of tests for fecal neutrophils in the setting of chronic diarrhea has not been established. The purpose of this study was to determine the causes of chronic diarrhea associated with fecal neutrophils. One fecal specimen from each of 10 normal subjects, 26 patients with known microscopic colitis, 13 with celiac sprue, eight with Crohn's disease, four with ulcerative colitis, and 103 with chronic diarrhea of unknown origin, as well as 10 fecal specimens from a patient with chronic nongranulomatous enterocolitis were analyzed blindly for the presence of a neutrophil granule protein called lactoferrin using a commercial latex agglutination kit. Diagnostic evaluation of the 103 patients with chronic diarrhea was carried out to determine the diagnostic accuracy of this test for chronic inflammatory bowel disease. None of the normal control subjects, three of 39 patients with microscopic colitis or celiac sprue, all 10 specimens from the patient with enterocolitis, and all 12 control patients with ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease had a positive fecal lactoferrin test. Eleven of 103 patients with chronic diarrhea presenting without a diagnosis had a positive test, and all were diagnosed with an inflammatory condition of the colon (five-, ulcerative colitis; four-, Crohn's disease; one-, ischemic colitis; and one-, microscopic colitis). Only one patient with inflammatory bowel disease had a negative lactoferrin test. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of the fecal lactoferrin test for ulcerative or Crohn's colitis were 90%, 98%, 82%, and 99%, respectively. The major cause of fecal neutrophils in patients with chronic diarrhea is chronic inflammatory bowel disease of the colon. The latex agglutination test for fecal lactoferrin offers a highly sensitive, specific, and simple means for detection of fecal neutrophils in these patients.","A case series of adult chronic diarrhea patients was identified. The study evaluated 103 patients referred to the same tertiary-care center. It is unclear whether these patients had a prior workup for chronic diarrhea. Secretory diarrhea was the most common etiology overall (45%). Other etiologies included malabsorption (28%), microscopic colitis (9%), inflammatory bowel disease (10%), and celiac sprue (3%)."
"What evaluation is best for an isolated, enlarged cervical lymph node
Lymphadenopathy is common, affecting patients of all ages. The current referral pattern for investigating patients with lymphadenopathy varies widely with no universally practised pathway. Our institution set up a lymph node diagnostic clinic (LNDC) accepting direct referrals from primary care physicians. Details of clinical presentation and investigations were recorded prospectively. Between December 1996 and July 2001, 550 patients were referred (M: 203; F:347). The median age was 40 years (range 14-90). The median time between initial referral and the first clinic visit was 6 days. Of 95 patients diagnosed to have malignant diseases, the median time from the first clinic visit to reaching malignant diagnosis was 15 days. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified five significant predictors for malignant nodes: male gender (risk ratio (RR)=2.72; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.63-4.56), increasing age (RR=1.05; 95% CI: 1.04-1.07), white ethnicity (RR=3.01; 95% CI: 1.19-7.6) and sites of lymph nodes: supraclavicular region (RR=3.72; 95% CI: 1.52-9.12) and > or = 2 regions of lymph nodes (RR=6.41; 95% CI: 2.82-14.58). Ultrasound and fine-needle aspiration cytology of palpable lymph nodes were performed in 154 and 289 patients, respectively. An accuracy of 97 and 84% was found, respectively. In conclusion, a multidisciplinary lymph node diagnostic clinic enables a rapid, concerted approach to a common medical problem and patients with malignant diseases were diagnosed in a timely fashion.",Another study demonstrated an ultrasound sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 97% for 154 patients with lymphadenopathy.
"What's the best treatment for CIN 2 or 3
The study was undertaken to provide consensus guidelines for the management of women with histologically confirmed cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) that can act as a precursor to invasive cervical cancer and represents one of the most common significant gynecologic diseases of women of reproductive age. An independent panel of 121 experts in various aspects of the diagnosis and management of cervical cancer precursors, including representatives from 29 participating professional organizations, federal agencies, national and international health organizations, and others were invited by the American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology (ASCCP).Consensus Process: Guidelines for the management of women with CIN were developed through a multistep process. Draft management guidelines were developed by working groups who performed formal literature reviews and obtained input from the professional community at large by way of an interactive internet-based bulletin board. At the ASCCP Consensus Conference, September 6 through 8, 2001, in Bethesda, Md, all guidelines were discussed, revised, and adopted by formal vote. Evidence-based guidelines have been developed for the management of women with biopsy-confirmed CIN.","The ASCCP guidelines note that there is a benefit to excisional treatment, as it allows pathologic assessment of the excised tissue. Some of the ASCCP guideline authors recommend excisional procedures for the management of large CIN 2 and 3 lesions, which are at increased risk of having microinvasive disease."
"When should you consider implanted nerve stimulators for lower back pain
The purpose of this report was to examine the available literature to determine the safety and efficacy of spinal cord stimulation (SCS) for the treatment of chronic pain of the trunk and limbs. The author identified 68 studies that fulfilled the efficacy inclusion/exclusion criteria, grouped on the basis of pain indication, with an overall population of 3679 patients. Fifty-one studies fulfilled all safety inclusion/exclusion criteria. Based on the literature review, the author found that SCS had a positive, symptomatic, long-term effect in cases of refractory angina pain, severe ischemic limb pain secondary to peripheral vascular disease, peripheral neuropathic pain, and chronic low-back pain, and that, in general, SCS was a safe and effective treatment for a variety of chronic neuropathic conditions. Despite the positive findings, there is an urgent need for randomized, controlled, long-term studies on the efficacy of SCS involving larger patient sample sizes.",Cameron's systematic review of 51 SCS studies reported rates for a number of complications. The most common complication was lead migration-displacement of the spinal electrodes that can cause pain to recur.
"Should the varicella vaccine be given to all children to prevent chickenpox
A review of the use of live attenuated varicella vaccine in immunocompromised children, particularly those with underlying leukemia in remission, is presented. Data concerning safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of this vaccine in high-risk children are reviewed. The unique contributions toward our understanding of varicella vaccine, including spread of vaccine-type virus, incidence of zoster, and immune correlates provided by studies of immunocompromised patients are discussed. The importance of protecting high-risk children against severe varicella by the use of varicella vaccine is apparent.","Some evidence suggests the incidence of herpes zoster is reduced in immunocompromised vaccine recipients, but long-term observation is needed to assess the effect on healthy recipients."
"Are any oral iron formulations better tolerated than ferrous sulfate
Absolute iron deficiency is treated by correcting the causative lesion and then, traditionally, administering sufficient amounts of ferrous salt to return the haemoglobin level to normal and replenish body stores. The bioavailability of ferric compounds has been questioned and accordingly their therapeutic role remains controversial. A special problem is posed by regular blood donation, where the frequency of phlebotomy is limited by the haemoglobin level, which, in turn, requires maintenance of an adequate supply of iron from dietary sources. Since this latter situation may not always occur, it would be of practical benefit to have a form of supplementation that is effective and can be taken without side effects. These issues were prospectively examined in a consecutive series of otherwise healthy blood donors who developed absolute iron deficiency anaemia and were then randomly allocated to receive 60 mg of this metal as ferrous sulphate twice a day (Group 1: n = 51), 100 mg as chewable ferric polymaltose daily (Group 2: n = 53), or the latter product twice a day (Group 3: n = 55). Serial studies showed that 80% of patients in Groups 1 and 3 had reached normal haemoglobin levels by 12 weeks, but this figure was only 50% in Group 2. Similarly, the proportion of patients improving their percentage saturation of transferrin to within the normal range was significantly better in Groups 1 and 3 than in Group 2 (P < .01). However, body iron stores, reflected in serum ferritin level, was significantly better in Group 1 (P < .01); there was no difference in this respect between Groups 2 and 3.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",A study of 159 subjects found fewer subjects discontinuing the polysaccharide-iron complex taken with meals than ferrous sulfate taken on an empty stomach.
"Sleep apnea in adults: How accurate is clinical prediction
To derive and validate a clinical decision rule that can help to prioritize patients who are on waiting lists for polysomnography, Prospective data collection on consecutive patients referred to a sleep center. The Newcastle Sleep Disorders Centre, University of Newcastle, NSW, Australia. Consecutive adult patients who had been scheduled for initial diagnostic polysomnography. Eight hundred and thirty-seven patients were used for derivation of the decision rule. An apnea-hypopnoea index of at least 5 was used as the cutoff point to diagnose sleep apnea. Fifteen clinical features were included in the analyses using logistic regression to construct a model from the derivation data set. Only 5 variables--age, sex, body mass index, snoring, and stopping breathing during sleep--were significantly associated with sleep apnea. A scoring scheme based on regression coefficients was developed, and the total score was trichotomized into low-, moderate-, and high-risk groups with prevalence of sleep apnea of 8%, 51%, and 82%, respectively. Color-coded tables were developed for ease of use. The clinical decision rule was validated on a separate set of 243 patients. Receiver operating characteristic analysis confirmed that the decision rule performed well, with the area under the curve being similar for both the derivation and validation sets: 0.81 and 0.79, P =.612. We conclude that this decision rule was able to accurately classify the risk of sleep apnea and will be useful for prioritizing patients with suspected sleep apnea who are on waiting lists for polysomnography.","A 2004 prospective evaluation examined a clinical decision rule on 837 patients referred for polysomnogram that used age, sex, BMI, snoring, and cessation of breathing during sleep to stratify patients into low-, moderate-, or high-risk groups. The study found obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome prevalences of 8%, 51%, and 82%, respectively."
"Which lifestyle interventions effectively lower low density lipoprotein cholesterol
To examine the association between cigarette smoking in adults and serum lipid and lipoprotein concentrations the results of 54 published studies were analysed. Overall, smokers had significantly higher serum concentrations of cholesterol (3.0%), triglycerides (9.1%), very low density lipoprotein cholesterol (10.4%), and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (1.7%) and lower serum concentrations of high density lipoprotein cholesterol (-5.7%) and apolipoprotein AI (-4.2%) compared with nonsmokers. Among non-smokers and light, moderate, and heavy smokers a significant dose response effect was present for cholesterol (0, 1.8, 4.3, and 4.5% respectively), triglycerides (0, 10.7, 11.5, and 18.0%), very low density lipoprotein cholesterol (0, 7.2, 44.4, and 39.0%), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (0, -1.1, 1.4, and 11.0%), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (0, -4.6, -6.3, and -8.9%), and apolipoprotein AI (0, -3.7 and -5.7% in non-smokers and light and heavy smokers). These dose response effects may provide new evidence for a causal relation between exposure to cigarette smoke and changes in serum lipid and lipoprotein concentrations whether as a direct result of physiological changes or of dietary changes induced by smoking. Adequate prospective data to estimate the excess risk of coronary artery disease existed only for cholesterol concentration. When that information was combined with data from the present study, and given that smokers as a group face an average overall excess risk of coronary artery disease of 70%, it was estimated that the observed increased serum cholesterol concentration in smokers may account for at least 9% of that excess risk. Furthermore, the dose response effect of smoking on serum cholesterol concentration suggests a gradient of increased absolute risk of coronary artery disease between light and heavy smokers.","One meta-analysis found a dose-dependent relationship between smoking and LDL-C, with overall LDL-C 1.7% higher for smokers compared with nonsmokers. Two RCTs investigated the effect of smoking cessation on LDL-C with mixed results. One (N=935) showed a decrease in nonfasting LDL-C while a second (N=140) showed no difference in LDL-C."
"What is the most effective diagnostic evaluation of streptococcal pharyngitis
The frequency of obtaining false-negative Group A Streptococcal (GAS) rapid antigen detection (RAD) tests utilizing currently available kits in a private practice setting and the cost effectiveness of requiring follow-up throat cultures were studied. Laboratory records of the Elmwood Pediatric Group (EPG), Rochester, NY, were retrospectively reviewed to identify all patients with pharyngeal RAD tests for GAS performed from January 1996 through May 1999. From January 1996 through October 1997 (study period 1), EPG physicians used either a RAD test or a throat culture to identify GAS; from November 1997 through May 1999 (study period 2), RAD tests were used as the primary test on all patients. Rapid antigen detection test negative results were confirmed with culture. During the 3-year study 11,427 RAD tests were performed. 8,385 (73.4%) were negative and 3,042 (26.6%) were positive. In study period 1, 3,547 (73.2%) were negative and 1,299 (26.8%) were positive; in study period 2 4,837 (73.5%) were negative and 1,743 (26.5%) were positive. Of the 8,385 negative tests, 8,234 (98.2%) were followed up with throat cultures. Of these, 200 (2.4%) were identified to have been negative RAD tests that were throat culture positive (132 [3.8%] of 3,474 in study period 1 and 68 [1.4%] of 4,764 in study period 2). A cost analysis was performed for study period 2, which showed that abandoning throat culture confirmation would generate a cost saving of $13,521 per year to the practice. Throat culture confirmation of RAD test negative results in pharyngitis patients may not be medically necessary for most patients with currently available RAD tests and is costly.","In a retrospective review of rapid antigen detection testing, investigators performed 11,427 rapid antigen detection tests over 3 years in a private pediatric group. There were 8385 negative tests, among which follow-up cultures detected 200 (2.4%) that were positive for GABHS. In the second half of the study, a newer rapid antigen detection test produced a false-negative rate of 1.4%."
"Does moderate exercise prevent myocardial infarction for patients with coronary heart disease
Regular exercise in patients with stable coronary artery disease has been shown to improve myocardial perfusion and to retard disease progression. We therefore conducted a randomized study to compare the effects of exercise training versus standard percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stenting on clinical symptoms, angina-free exercise capacity, myocardial perfusion, cost-effectiveness, and frequency of a combined clinical end point (death of cardiac cause, stroke, CABG, angioplasty, acute myocardial infarction, and worsening angina with objective evidence resulting in hospitalization). A total of 101 male patients aged < or =70 years were recruited after routine coronary angiography and randomized to 12 months of exercise training (20 minutes of bicycle ergometry per day) or to PCI. Cost efficiency was calculated as the average expense (in US dollars) needed to improve the Canadian Cardiovascular Society class by 1 class. Exercise training was associated with a higher event-free survival (88% versus 70% in the PCI group, P=0.023) and increased maximal oxygen uptake (+16%, from 22.7+/-0.7 to 26.2+/-0.8 mL O2/kg, P<0.001 versus baseline, P<0.001 versus PCI group after 12 months). To gain 1 Canadian Cardiovascular Society class, 6956 dollars was spent in the PCI group versus 3429 dollars in the training group (P<0.001). Compared with PCI, a 12-month program of regular physical exercise in selected patients with stable coronary artery disease resulted in superior event-free survival and exercise capacity at lower costs, notably owing to reduced rehospitalizations and repeat revascularizations.","A well-done study randomized 101 male patients (age <70 years) with stable angina to either a daily exercise program or standard percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty with stenting. After 12 months, event-free survival was significantly greater among patients randomized to exercise than in those randomized to percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty with stenting (88% vs 70%; P=.023; NNT=5.5). Cardiovascular events were defined as percutaneous interventions, hospitalizations, acute MI, cerebrovascular accidents, coronary artery bypass graft operation, and death."
"Do nonmedicated topicals relieve childhood eczema
Childhood atopic eczema is an increasingly common condition in young children. As well as being irritating to the child, it causes sleepless nights for both the child and the family and leads to difficulties in parental relationships and can have severe effects on employment. A group of eight children, born to professional working mothers were studied to test the hypothesis that massage with essential oils (aromatherapy) used as a complementary therapy in conjunction with normal medical treatment, would help to alleviate the symptoms of childhood atopic eczema. The children were randomly allocated to the massage with essential oils group and both counselled and massaged with a mixture of essential oils by the therapist once a week and the mother every day over a period of 8 weeks. The preferred essential oils, chosen by the mothers for their child, from 36 commonly used aromatherapy oils, were: sweet marjoram, frankinsence, German chamomile, myrrh, thyme, benzoin, spike lavender and Litsea cubeba. A control group of children received the counselling and massage without essential oils. The treatments were evaluated by means of daily day-time irritation scores and night time disturbance scores, determined by the mother before and during the treatment, both over an 8 week period; finally general improvement scores were allocated 2 weeks after the treatment by the therapist, the general practitioner and the mother. The study employed a single case experimental design across subjects, such that there were both a within-subject control and between-subjects control, through the interventions being introduced at different times. The results showed a significant improvement in the eczema in the two groups of children following therapy, but there was no significant difference in improvement shown between the aromatherapy massage and massage only group. Thus there is evidence that tactile contact between mother and child benefits the symptoms of atopic eczema but there is no proof that adding essential oils is more beneficial than massage alone. Further studies on the essential oil massage group showed a deterioration in the eczematous condition after two further 8 week periods of therapy, following a period of rest after the initial period of contact. This may have been due to a decline in the novelty of the treatment, or, it strongly suggests possible allergic contact dermatitis provoked by the essential oils themselves. The results of this study indicate the necessity of prolonged studies with novel plant extracts as short-term beneficial results could be overturned by adverse effects after repeated usage.","In 1 case control study, massage with essential oils did not improve eczema compared with massage without essential oils."
"What is the best way to evaluate and manage diarrhea in the febrile infant
The ability to assess the degree of dehydration quickly and accurately in infants and young children often determines patient treatment and disposition. To systematically review the precision and accuracy of symptoms, signs, and basic laboratory tests for evaluating dehydration in infants and children. We identified 1561 potential articles by multiple search strategies of the MEDLINE database through PubMed. Searches of bibliographies of retrieved articles, the Cochrane Library, textbooks, and private collections of experts in the field yielded an additional 42 articles. Twenty-six of 1603 reviewed studies contained original data on the precision or accuracy of findings for the diagnosis of dehydration in young children (1 month to 5 years). Two of the 3 authors independently reviewed and abstracted data for estimating the likelihood ratios (LRs) of diagnostic tests. We eliminated 13 of the 26 studies because of the lack of an accepted diagnostic standard or other limitation in study design. The other 13 studies were included in the review. The most useful individual signs for predicting 5% dehydration in children are an abnormal capillary refill time (LR, 4.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.7-9.8), abnormal skin turgor (LR, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.5-4.2), and abnormal respiratory pattern (LR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.5-2.7). Combinations of examination signs perform markedly better than any individual sign in predicting dehydration. Historical points and laboratory tests have only modest utility for assessing dehydration. The initial assessment of dehydration in young children should focus on estimating capillary refill time, skin turgor, and respiratory pattern and using combinations of other signs. The relative imprecision and inaccuracy of available tests limit the ability of clinicians to estimate the exact degree of dehydration.",A systematic review suggested the only blood test reliable for ruling out dehydration is a serum bicarbonate greater than 15 to 17 mEq/L.
"What are the most effective nonpharmacologic therapies for irritable bowel syndrome
Functional abdominal symptoms are very common and account for nearly two million primary care consultations in Britain every year and produce significant morbidity. The aims of this study were to evaluate the impact of two self-help interventions on consultation rates and symptom severity in patients with a primary care diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome. A total of 420 patients from 54 primary care centres were randomised either to receive self-help information in the form of a guidebook or the guidebook plus a ""self-help"" group meeting or to be in a control group receiving neither intervention. Data were collected using questionnaires and primary care records. At one year, patients in the guidebook group had a 60% reduction in primary care consultations (p < 0.001) and a reduction in perceived symptom severity (p < 0.001) compared with controls. Allocation to the self-help group conferred no additional benefit. Actual symptom scores did not change significantly in any group. Costs per patient were reduced by Pounds 73 (confidence interval Pounds 43, Pounds 103) or 40% per year. Introduction of a self-help guidebook results in a reduction in primary care consultations, a perceived reduction in symptoms, and significant health service savings. This suggests that patients attending their primary care physician with functional abdominal symptoms should be offered self-help information as part of their management.","A randomized controlled trials tested the use of an educational self-help guidebook. Outcomes were symptom score, perception of improvement, and primary care consultation rates. At 1 year, the self-help guidebook group had 1.56 visits/year less than the control group (95% CI, 1.15-1.98), a 60% decrease. The self-help guidebook group reported a higher degree of perceived improvement, with a mean effect of 0.51 (95% CI, 0.23-0.79); there were no differences in severity scores."
"For those intolerant to angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors and ARBs, what is the best therapy for reducing the risk of diabetic nephropathy
It is unknown whether either the angiotensin-II-receptor blocker irbesartan or the calcium-channel blocker amlodipine slows the progression of nephropathy in patients with type 2 diabetes independently of its capacity to lower the systemic blood pressure. We randomly assigned 1715 hypertensive patients with nephropathy due to type 2 diabetes to treatment with irbesartan (300 mg daily), amlodipine (10 mg daily), or placebo. The target blood pressure was 135/85 mm Hg or less in all groups. We compared the groups with regard to the time to the primary composite end point of a doubling of the base-line serum creatinine concentration, the development of end-stage renal disease, or death from any cause. We also compared them with regard to the time to a secondary, cardiovascular composite end point. The mean duration of follow-up was 2.6 years. Treatment with irbesartan was associated with a risk of the primary composite end point that was 20 percent lower than that in the placebo group (P=0.02) and 23 percent lower than that in the amlodipine group (P=0.006). The risk of a doubling of the serum creatinine concentration was 33 percent lower in the irbesartan group than in the placebo group (P=0.003) and 37 percent lower in the irbesartan group than in the amlodipine group (P<0.001). Treatment with irbesartan was associated with a relative risk of end-stage renal disease that was 23 percent lower than that in both other groups (P=0.07 for both comparisons). These differences were not explained by differences in the blood pressures that were achieved. The serum creatinine concentration increased 24 percent more slowly in the irbesartan group than in the placebo group (P=0.008) and 21 percent more slowly than in the amlodipine group (P=0.02). There were no significant differences in the rates of death from any cause or in the cardiovascular composite end point. The angiotensin-II-receptor blocker irbesartan is effective in protecting against the progression of nephropathy due to type 2 diabetes. This protection is independent of the reduction in blood pressure it causes.","In an RCT, amlodipine was no more effective than placebo in reducing proteinuria, while irbesartan effectively reduced end-stage renal disease (number needed to treat [NNT]=25 over 2.6 years)."
"What is the differential diagnosis of chronic diarrhea in immunocompetent patients
To evaluate the utility of screening for multiple gastrointestinal peptides in the evaluation of patients with chronic diarrhea, we studied 193 patients referred for evaluation of chronic diarrhea and eight patients with known peptide-secreting tumors as a reference group. Fasting plasma samples were assayed for motilin, neurotensin, pancreatic polypeptide, somatostatin, substance P, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, gastrin-releasing peptide, and calcitonin during a protocol evaluation for causes of chronic diarrhea. Although none of the referred patients were found to have tumors, abnormal levels of one or more peptides were found in 86 of 193 patients (45%). Abnormal plasma peptide levels were sometimes as high in these patients as in patients with known peptide-secreting tumors and would have led to mistaken diagnoses of tumors much more often than they would have led to correct diagnoses. The positive predictive value of elevation of any assayed peptide was < 2% at realistic prevalence rates for peptide-secreting tumors; the negative predictive value of a series of normal results was > 99%, but much of this was due to the rarity of these tumors. Patients with chronic diarrhea should not be screened routinely with a panel of plasma peptide assays in an effort to detect tumors; instead, peptide levels should be ordered selectively. Elevated fasting concentrations of the plasma peptides measured in this study are most likely epiphenomena due to diarrhea and should not be the sole basis for invasive diagnostic or surgical management of these patients.","A case series of adult chronic diarrhea patients was identified. The study evaluated 193 patients referred to a tertiary-care center for diarrhea. Secretory diarrhea was the most common etiology overall (21%). Other etiologies included malabsorption (35%), microscopic colitis (15%), inflammatory bowel disease (16%), and celiac sprue (0%)."
"Should you test or treat partners of patients with gonorrhea, chlamydia, or trichomoniasis
Infections with Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) are common and recurrence rates are high. Better methods of treating partners of women with trichomoniasis are needed. To determine if patient-delivered partner treatment (PDPT) is better and more cost-effective than partner referral. Women attending a family planning clinic who were culture-positive and treated for TV (N = 463) were randomized to either standard partner referral (PR), booklet-enhanced partner referral (BEPR), or PDPT. At baseline and 1 month, women were interviewed and cultured for TV. Detailed cost information was also collected. Most women had 1 partner, were less than 24 years old, and were black. The percentage of women reporting that their partners were treated was similar for PDPT but significantly lower for BEPR compared to PR. TV follow-up rates were similar. PDPT cost less and was cost saving compared to PR and BEPR. Among women with TV, PDPT did not result in more partners taking the medicine or lower follow-up rates than PR but was less costly.","An randomized controlled trials showed a decrease in recurrent or persistent chlamydial infection in the index patient, but the difference did not reach statistical significance. The randomized controlled trials demonstrated a statistically significant decrease in persistent or recurrent gonococcal infection for expedited partner treatment for gonorrhea."
"What is the best way to diagnose polycystic ovarian syndrome
To evaluate the cardiovascular risk of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), we investigated lipid profile, metabolic pattern, and echocardiography in 30 young women with PCOS and 30 healthy age- and body mass index (BMI)-matched women. PCOS women had higher fasting glucose and insulin levels, homeostasis model assessment score of insulin sensitivity, total cholesterol (TC) and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels, and TC/high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) ratio and lower HDL-C levels than controls. Additionally, PCOS women had higher left atrium size (32.0 +/- 4.9 vs. 27.4 +/- 2.1 mm; P < 0.0001) and left ventricular mass index (80.5 +/- 18.1 vs. 56.1 +/- 5.4 g/m(2); P < 0.0001) and lower left ventricular ejection fraction (64.4 +/- 4.1 vs. 67.1 +/- 2.6%; P = 0.003) and early to late mitral flow velocity ratio (1.6 +/- 0.4 vs. 2.1 +/- 0.2; P < 0.0001) than controls. When patients and controls were grouped according to BMI [normal weight (BMI, >18 and <25 kg/m(2)), overweight (BMI, 25.1-30 kg/m(2)), and obese (BMI, >30 kg/m(2))], the differences between PCOS women and controls were maintained in overweight and obese women. In normal weight PCOS women, a significant increase in left ventricular mass index and a decrease in diastolic filling were observed, notwithstanding no change in TC, LDL-C, HDL-C, TC/HDL-C ratio, and TG compared with controls. In conclusion, our data show the detrimental effect of PCOS on the cardiovascular system even in young women asymptomatic for cardiac disease.","A prospective case-control study of young women (aged <35 years) found that compared with age- and BMI-matched controls, those with PCOS had higher levels of fasting glucose, insulin, total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and altered left ventricular mass and cardiac function on echocardiogram. Once PCOS is suspected, the diagnostic work-up should include a 2-hour glucose tolerance test and lipid panel to assess cardiovascular risk, particularly among obese women."
"Are major bleeding events from falls more likely in patients on warfarin
BACKGROUND: The use of antithrombotic agents and falls are independently associated with an increased risk of hemorrhagic injury. However, few studies have delineated the risk of fall-related hemorrhagic complications in persons who are taking antithrombotic therapy. The objective of this study was to compare the rates of fall-related hemorrhagic injury in hospital in-patients who are taking and not taking antithrombotic therapy. METHODS: A 4-year retrospective chart review of consecutive patients who fell during admission to a 500-bed tertiary-care teaching hospital was conducted. Major hemorrhagic injuries including subdural hematomas and major bleeding/cuts, patients' use of antithrombotic medication (warfarin, aspirin, clopidogrel and heparin) and their anticoagulation status at the time of their fall were recorded. RESULTS: A total of 2635 falls in 1861 patients were reviewed. Approximately 10% of falls caused major hemorrhagic injury. One fall resulted in a subdural hematoma. Persons taking warfarin were less likely to suffer a fall-related major hemorrhagic injury compared with persons not taking antithrombotic therapy (warfarin, 6%; no therapy, 11%; p = 0.01). Logistic regression showed that fall-related major hemorrhagic injury was associated with female gender (odds ratio 1.6; 95% CI 1.3, 2.1), use of aspirin (odds ratio 1.4; 95% CI 1.1, 1.8) and use of clopidogrel (odds ratio 2.2; 95% CI 1.1, 4.8), but not with the use of warfarin or heparin, or the intensity of anticoagulation. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, compared with persons taking no antithrombotic therapy, those taking warfarin had lower rates of fall-related hemorrhagic injuries. The absolute rate of the development of fall-related intracranial hemorrhagic injury such as subdural hematomas was low, even in persons taking warfarin. These counter-intuitive results may be due to selection bias, and suggest that physicians are very conservative in selecting patients for warfarin therapy, choosing only those who are sufficiently healthy to be at much lower than average risk of suffering fall-related hemorrhagic injuries. This phenomenon may lead to physicians overestimating the potential for fall-related major hemorrhagic injury in persons taking antithrombotic therapy, with the possible denial of warfarin therapy to many of those who would benefit. This perception may contribute to the care gap between the number of patients who would theoretically derive overall benefit from warfarin therapy and those who are actually receiving it.",One retrospective study of 2633 falls in 1861 hospital inpatients compared the rate of major hemorrhage between those taking anticoagulation therapy with those not taking it. Major hemorrhage was defined as bruising or cuts requiring immediate attention from a physician. The rate of major hemorrhage was 6.2% for patients taking warfarin and 11.3% for patients receiving no therapy. Patients with INR=2-3 had a major hemorrhage rate of 6.9% compared with 10.1% for those with international normalized ratio <1.3. Criteria for using warfarin were not reported; there may have been selection bias in favor of prescribing warfarin for patients judged less likely to fall.
"What are effective strategies for reducing the risk of steroid-induced osteoporosis
To evaluate the continued efficacy and safety of alendronate (ALN) for up to 2 years in patients receiving glucocorticoids. This is a 12-month extension of a previously completed 1-year trial of daily ALN, performed to evaluate the effects of ALN over a total of 2 years in 66 men and 142 women continuing to receive at least 7.5 mg of prednisone or equivalent daily. All patients received supplemental calcium and vitamin D. The primary end point was the mean percentage change in lumbar spine bone mineral density (BMD) from baseline to 24 months. Other outcomes included changes in hip and total body BMD, biochemical markers of bone turnover, radiographic joint damage of the hands, and vertebral fracture incidence. The mean (+/-SEM) lumbar spine BMD increased by 2.8 +/- 0.6%, 3.9 +/- 0.7%, and 3.7 +/- 0.6%, respectively, in the groups that received 5 mg, 10 mg, and 2.5/10 mg of ALN daily (P < or = 0.001) and decreased by -0.8 +/- 0.6% in the placebo group (P not significant) over 24 months. In patients receiving any dose of ALN, BMD was increased at the trochanter (P < or = 0.05) and maintained at the femoral neck. Total body BMD was increased in patients receiving 5 or 10 mg ALN (P < or = 0.01). These 2 dose levels of ALN were more effective than placebo at all sites (P < or = 0.05). Bone turnover markers (N-telopeptides of type I collagen and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase) decreased 60% and 25%, respectively, during treatment with ALN (P < or = 0.05). There were fewer patients with new vertebral fractures in the ALN group versus the placebo group (0.7% versus 6.8%; P = 0.026). The safety profile was similar between treatment groups. Alendronate is an effective, well-tolerated therapy for the prevention and treatment of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis, with sustained treatment advantages for up to 2 years.","A two-year randomized controlled trials of 208 patients receiving steroids who also received alendronate or placebo demonstrated an incidence of vertebral fracture of 0.7% and 6.8% (NNT=16; RRR=90%; absolute risk reduction = 5.9%; P=.026), respectively."

Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) is the most common pre-malignant lesion. Atypical squamous changes occur in the transformation zone of the cervix with mild, moderate or severe changes described by their depth (CIN 1, 2 or 3). Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia is treated by local ablation or lower morbidity excision techniques. Choice of treatment depends on the grade and extent of the disease. To assess the effectiveness and safety of alternative surgical treatments for CIN. We searched the Cochrane Gynaecological Cancer Group Trials Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE and EMBASE (up to April 2009). We also searched registers of clinical trials, abstracts of scientific meetings and reference lists of included studies. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of alternative surgical treatments in women with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. Two review authors independently abstracted data and assessed risks of bias. Risk ratios that compared residual disease after the follow-up examination and adverse events in women who received one of either laser ablation, laser conisation, large loop excision of the transformation zone (LLETZ), knife conisation or cryotherapy were pooled in random-effects model meta-analyses. Twenty-nine trials were included. Seven surgical techniques were tested in various comparisons. No significant differences in treatment failures were demonstrated in terms of persistent disease after treatment. Large loop excision of the transformation zone appeared to provide the most reliable specimens for histology with the least morbidity. Morbidity was lower than with laser conisation, although the trials did not provide data for every outcome measure. There were not enough data to assess the effect on morbidity when compared with laser ablation. The evidence suggests that there is no obvious superior surgical technique for treating cervical intraepithelial neoplasia in terms of treatment failures or operative morbidity.","All 7 available surgical techniques were found to have similar efficacy, in a 2005 Cochrane review of 28 randomized trials. Resolution of CIN 2 or 3 lesions was 77% to 98%, using knife cone biopsy, laser conization, loop excision, laser ablation, cryotherapy, or 2 techniques not used commonly in the US, cold coagulation and radical diathermy. Surgical techniques were tested in various combinations, but no trial compared all of the techniques with one another. Most studies were underpowered, limiting the results.Morbidity was compared with one-on-one trials of different techniques. The review noted that loop electrosurgical excision procedure has the least morbidity (such as hemorrhage, infection, cervical stenosis, and midtrimester pregnancy loss) while providing the most reliable histology by excising tissue without causing thermal artifact."
"What steps can reduce morbidity and mortality caused by hip fractures
This article discusses the prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and is part of the Seventh American College of Chest Physicians Conference on Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy: Evidence-Based Guidelines. Grade 1 recommendations are strong and indicate that the benefits do, or do not, outweigh risks, burden, and costs. Grade 2 suggests that individual patients' values may lead to different choices (for a full understanding of the grading see Guyatt et al, CHEST 2004; 126:179S-187S). Among the key recommendations in this chapter are the following. We recommend against the use of aspirin alone as thromboprophylaxis for any patient group (Grade 1A). For moderate-risk general surgery patients, we recommend prophylaxis with low-dose unfractionated heparin (LDUH) (5,000 U bid) or low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) [< or = 3,400 U once daily] (both Grade 1A). For higher risk general surgery patients, we recommend thromboprophylaxis with LDUH (5,000 U tid) or LMWH (> 3,400 U daily) [both Grade 1A]. For high-risk general surgery patients with multiple risk factors, we recommend combining pharmacologic methods (LDUH three times daily or LMWH, > 3,400 U daily) with the use of graduated compression stockings and/or intermittent pneumatic compression devices (Grade 1C+). We recommend that thromboprophylaxis be used in all patients undergoing major gynecologic surgery (Grade 1A) or major, open urologic procedures, and we recommend prophylaxis with LDUH two times or three times daily (Grade 1A). For patients undergoing elective total hip or knee arthroplasty, we recommend one of the following three anticoagulant agents: LMWH, fondaparinux, or adjusted-dose vitamin K antagonist (VKA) [international normalized ratio (INR) target, 2.5; range, 2.0 to 3.0] (all Grade 1A). For patients undergoing hip fracture surgery (HFS), we recommend the routine use of fondaparinux (Grade 1A), LMWH (Grade 1C+), VKA (target INR, 2.5; range, 2.0 to 3.0) [Grade 2B], or LDUH (Grade 1B). We recommend that patients undergoing hip or knee arthroplasty, or HFS receive thromboprophylaxis for at least 10 days (Grade 1A). We recommend that all trauma patients with at least one risk factor for VTE receive thromboprophylaxis (Grade 1A). In acutely ill medical patients who have been admitted to the hospital with congestive heart failure or severe respiratory disease, or who are confined to bed and have one or more additional risk factors, we recommend prophylaxis with LDUH (Grade 1A) or LMWH (Grade 1A). We recommend, on admission to the intensive care unit, all patients be assessed for their risk of VTE. Accordingly, most patients should receive thromboprophylaxis (Grade 1A).","After a hip fracture, patients are at very high risk for VTE. For untreated patients, the rate of deep vein thromboses (DVT) may be as high as 50%, with an associated fatal pulmonary embolism rate as high as 7.5%."
"Is surgery effective for reducing symptoms in adults with obstructive sleep apnea
To assess separately the effectiveness and safety of nasal-continuous positive airway pressure (N-CPAP) and that of surgery in comparison to conservative management in patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). DESIGN. A randomized study with 1-year follow-up. A university hospital acting as a referral center for OSAS. Symptomatic patients with OSAS (72 male and 4 female patients aged 18 to 65 years), who had oxygen desaturations in the overnight recording. After the initial diagnostic workup, patients were considered to be candidates for either N-CPAP (44 patients) or surgical treatment (uvulopalatopharyngoplasty [UPPP] with or without mandibular osteotomy) (32 patients). Within the groups, the patients were then randomized to either the assigned treatment or conservative management. The number of nocturnal oxygen desaturation events of 4% or more per hour in bed (ODI4); daytime somnolence; side effects. N-CPAP Group: Compliance with N-CPAP therapy at 1 year was 13 of 21. The most common reason for noncompliance was general intolerance of CPAP. All compliant patients had a normal ODI4 ( < 10), whereas 1 of 20 of their control subjects had a normal finding. Patients receiving active treatment were significantly less somnolent than their control subjects at 1 year (p < 0.05). SURGERY GROUP: At 1 year, 7 of 18 of the surgically treated and 1 of 14 of the conservatively treated patients had a normal ODI4 (p < 0.001). Daytime somnolence was significantly less severe in the surgically treated patients compared with their control subjects (p < 0.001) both at 3 and 12 months. The overall postoperative complication rate was 22%. N-CPAP is an effective therapy for OSAS, but compliance is a problem. Surgical therapy (UPPP with or without mandibular osteotomy) needs further evaluation.","Lojander et al compared uvulopharyngopalatoplasty (UPPP) to conservative management (weight loss, smoking cessation, and alcohol avoidance advice) in 32 patients. Patients were excluded if they had asthma, obesity (body mass index >40), restless leg syndrome, hypothyroidism, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or intolerance of missed work because of somnolence. Remaining patients were selected as possible surgical candidates by a team of hospital-based experts then randomized to surgery or conservative therapy. At 1 year of follow-up, they found no change in nocturnal oxygen desaturation but some improvement in the mean score of a visual analog scale of daytime sleepiness and in the mean self-report of out-of-bed sleeping episodes. Unfortunately these subjective outcome measures have not been validated and are subject to bias. This, in addition to lack of intention-to-treat analysis, renders these results uninterpretable."
"What are the indications for evaluating a patient with cough for pertussis
To diagnose pertussis using culture, polymerase chain reaction, and serology, in children admitted to intensive care units (PICUs) and some paediatric wards in London, and in their household contacts to determine the source of infection. Infants <5 months old admitted to London PICUs between 1998 and 2000 with respiratory failure, apnoea and/or bradycardia, or acute life threatening episodes (ALTE), and children <15 years admitted to paediatric wards at St Mary's and St George's Hospitals between 1999 and 2000 with lower respiratory tract infection, apnoea, or ALTE were studied. Sixty seven per cent of eligible children (142/212) were recruited; 23% (33/142) had pertussis, 19.8% (25/126) on the PICU and 50% (8/16) on wards. Two died. Only 4% (6/142) were culture positive. Pertussis was clinically suspected on admission in 28% of infants (7/25) on the PICU and 75% (6/8) on the wards. Infants on PICU with pertussis coughed for longer, had apnoeas and whooped more often, and a higher lymphocyte count than infants without pertussis. Pertussis and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) co-infection was frequent (11/33, 33%). Pertussis was confirmed in 22/33 (67%) of those who were first to become ill in the family. For 14/33 children the source of infection was a parent; for 9/33 the source of pertussis was an older fully vaccinated child in the household. Severe pertussis is under diagnosed. An RSV diagnosis does not exclude pertussis. Future changes to the UK vaccination programme should aim to reduce pertussis transmission to young infants by their parents and older siblings.","A British study of 126 infants aged <5 months admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit with apnea, bradycardia, or respiratory failure found that 20% had pertussis. Apnea as a predictor of pertussis had a sensitivity of 68% and a specificity of 60%."
"What is the best diagnostic approach to alopecia in women
To describe an organized diagnostic approach for both nonscarring and scarring alopecias to help family physicians establish an accurate in-office diagnosis. To explain when ancillary laboratory workup is necessary to confirm the diagnosis. Current diagnostic and therapeutic interventions for hair loss are based on randomized controlled studies, uncontrolled studies, and case series. MEDLINE was searched from January 1966 to December 1998 with the MeSH words alopecia, hair, and alopecia areata. Articles were selected on the basis of experimental design, with priority given to the most current large multicentre controlled studies. Overall global evidence for therapeutic intervention for hair loss is quite strong. The most common forms of nonscarring alopecias are androgenic alopecia, telogen effluvium, and alopecia areata. Other disorders include trichotillomania, traction alopecia, tinea capitis, and hair shaft abnormalities. Scarring alopecia is caused by trauma, infections, discoid lupus erythematosus, or lichen planus. Key to establishing an accurate diagnosis is a detailed history, including medication use, systemic illnesses, endocrine dysfunction, hair-care practices, and family history. All hair-bearing sites should be examined. A 4-mm punch biopsy of the scalp is useful, particularly to diagnose scarring alopecias. Once a diagnosis has been established, specific therapy can be initiated. Diagnosis and management of hair loss is an interesting challenge for family physicians. An organized approach to recognizing characteristic differential features of hair loss disorders is key to diagnosis and management.","A family history of alopecia areata or androgenic alopecia can point to a genetic cause. Acne or abnormal menses can indicate androgen excess, suggesting androgenic alopecia. Positive answers to thyroid screening questions can point to hypothyroidism, and abnormal diet patterns can suggest iron-deficiency anemia. Unusual hair care practices can cause traction alopecia."
"What's the best treatment for pyogenic granuloma
Pyogenic granuloma is a benign, acquired, proliferative vascular lesion of the skin and mucous membranes. Many different treatments have been used for pyogenic granuloma with variable success rates. To evaluate the efficacy of cryotherapy in the treatment of pyogenic granuloma. In a prospective observational study, 135 patients with pyogenic granuloma were treated with cryotherapy using liquid nitrogen. The patients were followed up every 3 weeks until 3 months after disappearance of the lesion. Complete resolution of the pyogenic granuloma was achieved in all patients after a mean of 1.58 treatments (range, 1-4 treatments). At the end of follow-up period, there was a flat imperceptible scar, smaller than the treated lesion, in 16 patients (11.8%). A hypertrophic scar, 3 mm in diameter, was observed in one patient. Hypopigmentation was observed in seven patients (5.1%). No other complication or side-effect was recorded in the study. We believe that pyogenic granuloma can be treated simply and effectively with cryotherapy.","A case series reported on 135 patients (mean age 26 years; range 4 months to 70 years) whose pyogenic granulomas were treated with cryotherapy. Seventy-eight (58%) had complete resolution with 1 session, 30% needed 2 sessions, 8% needed 3 sessions, and 5% needed 4 sessions (mean 1.58 sessions). Ninety-four percent had an excellent cosmetic result (including 12% with a small flat scar); 5% had residual hypopigmentation."
"What is a reasonable initial approach to the patient with fatigue
To develop an evidence-based systematic approach to assessment of adult patients who present to family physicians complaining of fatigue of less than 6 months' duration. The guidelines present investigative options, making explicit what should be considered in all cases and what should be considered only in specific situations. They aim to provide physicians with an approach that, to the extent possible, is based on evidence so that time and cost are minimized and detection and management of the cause of the fatigue are optimized. MEDLINE was searched from 1966 to 1997 using the key words ""family practice"" and ""fatigue."" Articles about chronic fatigue syndrome were excluded. Articles with level 3 evidence were found, but no randomized trials, cohort studies, or case-control studies were found. Articles looking specifically at the epidemiology, demographics, investigations, and diagnoses of patients with fatigue were chosen. Articles based on studies at referral and specialty centres were given less weight than those based on studies in family physicians' offices. Adherence to these guidelines will decrease the cost of investigating the symptom of fatigue and optimize diagnosis and management. This needs to be proved in practice, however, and with research that produces level 1 and 2 evidence. Adults presenting with fatigue of less than 6 months' duration should be assessed for psychosocial causes and should have a focused history and physical examination to determine whether further investigations should be done. The guidelines outline investigations to be considered. The elderly require special consideration. These guidelines have group validation, but they need to be tested by more physicians in various locations and types of practices.","A guideline developed by a group of family physicians provides the best overview of the topic. They recommend performing a detailed history and physical examination with further investigation reserved for patients with signs and symptoms of treatable causes of fatigue, such as anemia or hypothyroidism. They also recommend a somewhat more aggressive approach to investigation for patients older than 65 years."
"What is the clinical workup for failure to thrive
To ascertain the long term outcomes in children diagnosed as having failure to thrive (FTT). Systematic review of cohort studies. Medline, Psychinfo, Embase, Cinahl, Web of Science, Cochrane, and DARE databases were searched for potentially relevant studies. Inclusion criteria: cohort studies or randomised controlled trials in children <2 years old with failure to thrive defined as weight <10th centile or lower centile and/or weight velocity <10th centile, with growth, development, or behaviour measured at 3 years of age or older. Thirteen studies met the inclusion criteria; eight included a comparison group, of which five included children identified in community settings. Two were randomised controlled trials. Attrition rates were 10-30%. Data from population based studies with comparison groups and which reported comparable outcomes in an appropriate form were pooled in a random effects meta-analysis. Four studies report IQ scores at follow up and the pooled standardised mean difference was -0.22 (95% CI -0.41 to -0.03). Two studies reported growth data as standard deviation scores. Their pooled weighted mean difference for weight was -1.24 SDS (95% CI -2.00 to -0.48), and for height -0.87 SDS (95% CI -1.47 to -0.28). No studies corrected for parental height, but two reported that parents of index children were shorter. The IQ difference (equivalent to approximately 3 IQ points) is of questionable clinical significance. The height and weight differences are larger, but few children were below the 3rd centile at follow up. It is unclear to what extent observed differences reflect causal relations or confounding due to other variables. In the light of these results the aggressive approach to identification and management of failure to thrive needs reassessing.","failure to thrive occurs when nutritive intake is insufficient to meet demands for growth. It is usually manifested by failure to gain weight. In more severe cases, height and head circumference are affected. failure to thrive is also associated with lower developmental testing scores."
"How much does smoking cessation cut coronary heart disease risk
Although the importance of smoking as a risk factor for coronary heart disease is beyond doubt, the speed and magnitude of risk reduction when a smoker with coronary heart disease quits are still subjects of debate. To estimate the magnitude of risk reduction when a patient with CHD stops smoking. We searched the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index, CINAHL, PsychLit, Dissertation Abstracts, BIDS ISI Index to Scientific and Technical Proceedings, UK National Research Register from the start of each database. Sixty-one large international cohort studies of cardiovascular disease were identified, and contact made with authors to search for any unpublished results. The search was supplemented by cross-checking references and contact with various experts. Date of last search was April 2003. Any prospective cohort studies of patients with a diagnosis of CHD, which include all-cause mortality as an outcome measure. Smoking status must be measured on at least two occasions to ascertain which smokers have quit, and followed-up for at least two years. Eligibility and trial quality were assessed independently by two reviewers. Twenty studies were included. There was a 36% reduction in crude relative risk (RR) of mortality for those who quit smoking compared with those who continued to smoke (RR 0.64, 95% confidence interval 0.58 to 0.71). There was also a reduction in non-fatal myocardial infarctions (crude RR 0.68, 95% confidence interval 0.57 to 0.82). Many studies did not adequately address quality issues, such as control of confounding, and misclassification of smoking status. However, there was little difference in the results for the six 'higher quality' studies, and little heterogeneity between these studies. This review was not able to assess how quickly the risk of mortality was reduced. Quitting smoking is associated with a substantial reduction in risk of all-cause mortality among patients with CHD. The pooled crude RR was 0.64 (95% CI 0.58 to 0.71). This 36% risk reduction appears substantial compared with other secondary preventive therapies such as cholesterol lowering which have received greater attention in recent years. The risk reduction associated with quitting smoking seems consistent regardless of differences between the studies in terms of index cardiac events, age, sex, country, and time period. However, relatively few studies have included large numbers of older people, women, or people of non-European descent, and most were carried out in Western countries.","A Cochrane Heart Group meta-analysis examining all-cause coronary heart disease mortality in 20 cohort studies (n=12,603 patients), found a 36% reduction in mortality risk for coronary heart disease patients who quit smoking compared with those who did not (RR=0.64; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.58-0.71). The review also noted a reduction in risk for nonfatal myocardial infarctions (RR=0.68; 95% CI, 0.57-0.82)."
"Do antioxidants vitamins C, E improve outcomes in patients with coronary artery disease
Vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) is thought to have a role in prevention of atherosclerosis, through inhibition of oxidation of low-density lipoprotein. Some epidemiological studies have shown an association between high dietary intake or high serum concentrations of alpha-tocopherol and lower rates of ischaemic heart disease. We tested the hypothesis that treatment with a high dose of alpha-tocopherol would reduce subsequent risk of myocardial infarction (MI) and cardiovascular death in patients with established ischaemic heart disease. In this double-blind, placebo-controlled study with stratified randomisation, 2002 patients with angiographically proven coronary atherosclerosis were enrolled and followed up for a median of 510 days (range 3-981). 1035 patients were assigned alpha-tocopherol (capsules containing 800 IU daily for first 546 patients; 400 IU daily for remainder); 967 received identical placebo capsules. The primary endpoints were a combination of cardiovascular death and non-fatal MI as well as non-fatal MI alone. Plasma alpha-tocopherol concentrations (measured in subsets of patients) rose in the actively treated group (from baseline mean 34.2 micromol/L to 51.1 micromol/L with 400 IU daily and 64.5 micromol/L with 800 IU daily) but did not change in the placebo group. Alpha-tocopherol treatment significantly reduced the risk of the primary trial endpoint of cardiovascular death and non-fatal MI (41 vs 64 events; relative risk 0.53 [95% Cl 0.34-0.83; p=0.005). The beneficial effects on this composite endpoint were due to a significant reduction in the risk of non-fatal MI (14 vs 41; 0.23 [0.11-0.47]; p=0.005); however, there was a non-significant excess of cardiovascular deaths in the alpha-tocopherol group (27 vs 23; 1.18 [0.62-2.27]; p=0.61). All-cause mortality was 36 of 1035 alpha-tocopherol-treated patients and 27 of 967 placebo recipients. We conclude that in patients with angiographically proven symptomatic coronary atherosclerosis, alpha-tocopherol treatment substantially reduces the rate of non-fatal MI, with beneficial effects apparent after 1 year of treatment. The effect of alpha-tocopherol treatment on cardiovascular deaths requires further study.","One double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized controlled trials demonstrated no change in all-cause mortality or incidence of total cardiovascular events. This study of 2002 persons receiving 400-800 IU/d showed a statistically significant reduction of non-fatal coronary events (relative risk [RR], 0.62)."
"Are liver function tests required for patients taking isoniazid for latent tuberculosis
In November 1992, the New York State Department of Health was notified of a patient who underwent liver transplantation because of severe hepatitis that developed during the use of isoniazid (INH) preventive therapy (IPT) for latent tuberculous infection. Inquiry at liver transplant centers in New York revealed other patients who had hepatitis attributed to INH. This report summarizes findings of the ongoing investigation into the extent and causes of this problem.","Seven of the 8 patients receiving a liver transplant following the development of fulminant, isoniazid-related hepatitis continued to take the drug for a least 10 days after onset of symptoms of hepatotoxicity."
"What nonpharmacological treatments are effective against common nongenital warts
To determine if application of duct tape is as effective as cryotherapy in the treatment of common warts. A prospective, randomized controlled trial with 2 treatment arms for warts in children. The general pediatric and adolescent clinics at a military medical center. A total of 61 patients (age range, 3-22 years) were enrolled in the study from October 31, 2000, to July 25, 2001; 51 patients completed the study and were available for analysis. Patients were randomized using computer-generated codes to receive either cryotherapy (liquid nitrogen applied to each wart for 10 seconds every 2-3 weeks) for a maximum of 6 treatments or duct tape occlusion (applied directly to the wart) for a maximum of 2 months. Patients had their warts measured at baseline and with return visits. Complete resolution of the wart being studied. Of the 51 patients completing the study, 26 (51%) were treated with duct tape, and 25 (49%) were treated with cryotherapy. Twenty-two patients (85%) in the duct tape arm vs 15 patients (60%) enrolled in the cryotherapy arm had complete resolution of their warts (P =.05 by chi(2) analysis). The majority of warts that responded to either therapy did so within the first month of treatment. Duct tape occlusion therapy was significantly more effective than cryotherapy for treatment of the common wart.",One randomized controlled trial of 61 patients showed cure rates of 85% with duct tape vs 60% with cryotherapy. Duct tape therapy had the advantages of reduced cost and less pain.
"What are the most effective nonpharmacologic therapies for irritable bowel syndrome
Patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) often feel they have some form of dietary intolerance and frequently try exclusion diets. Tests attempting to predict food sensitivity in IBS have been disappointing but none has utilised IgG antibodies. To assess the therapeutic potential of dietary elimination based on the presence of IgG antibodies to food. A total of 150 outpatients with IBS were randomised to receive, for three months, either a diet excluding all foods to which they had raised IgG antibodies (enzyme linked immunosorbant assay test) or a sham diet excluding the same number of foods but not those to which they had antibodies. Primary outcome measures were change in IBS symptom severity and global rating scores. Non-colonic symptomatology, quality of life, and anxiety/depression were secondary outcomes. Intention to treat analysis was undertaken using a generalised linear model. After 12 weeks, the true diet resulted in a 10% greater reduction in symptom score than the sham diet (mean difference 39 (95% confidence intervals (CI) 5-72); p = 0.024) with this value increasing to 26% in fully compliant patients (difference 98 (95% CI 52-144); p<0.001). Global rating also significantly improved in the true diet group as a whole (p = 0.048, NNT = 9) and even more in compliant patients (p = 0.006, NNT = 2.5). All other outcomes showed trends favouring the true diet. Relaxing the diet led to a 24% greater deterioration in symptoms in those on the true diet (difference 52 (95% CI 18-88); p = 0.003). Food elimination based on IgG antibodies may be effective in reducing IBS symptoms and is worthy of further biomedical research.","An elimination diet, based on the presence of IgG antibodies to various foods, was compared with a sham diet in an RCT. Those who fully adhered to the diet reported symptom reduction, with a mean symptom score 98 points lower (95% CI, 52-144; NNT=2.5). (A 50-point drop was considered clinically significant.)"
"What is the target for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in patients with heart disease
In patients with coronary heart disease and a broad range of cholesterol levels, cholesterol-lowering therapy reduces the risk of coronary events, but the effects on mortality from coronary heart disease and overall mortality have remained uncertain. In a double-blind, randomized trial, we compared the effects of pravastatin (40 mg daily) with those of a placebo over a mean follow-up period of 6.1 years in 9014 patients who were 31 to 75 years of age. The patients had a history of myocardial infarction or hospitalization for unstable angina and initial plasma total cholesterol levels of 155 to 271 mg per deciliter. Both groups received advice on following a cholesterol-lowering diet. The primary study outcome was mortality from coronary heart disease. Death from coronary heart disease occurred in 8.3 percent of the patients in the placebo group and 6.4 percent of those in the pravastatin group, a relative reduction in risk of 24 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 12 to 35 percent; P<0.001). Overall mortality was 14.1 percent in the placebo group and 11.0 percent in the pravastatin group (relative reduction in risk, 22 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 13 to 31 percent; P<0.001). The incidence of all cardiovascular outcomes was consistently lower among patients assigned to receive pravastatin; these outcomes included myocardial infarction (reduction in risk, 29 percent; P<0.001), death from coronary heart disease or nonfatal myocardial infarction (a 24 percent reduction in risk, P<0.001), stroke (a 19 percent reduction in risk, P=0.048), and coronary revascularization (a 20 percent reduction in risk, P<0.001). The effects of treatment were similar for all predefined subgroups. There were no clinically significant adverse effects of treatment with pravastatin. Pravastatin therapy reduced mortality from coronary heart disease and overall mortality, as compared with the rates in the placebo group, as well as the incidence of all prespecified cardiovascular events in patients with a history of myocardial infarction or unstable angina who had a broad range of initial cholesterol levels.","The Long-Term Intervention with Pravastatin in Ischaemic Disease study randomized patients to pravastatin 40 mg daily or placebo, without titration. Subgroup analyses suggested that patients with coronary artery disease and low initial low density lipoprotein levels (< 125 mg/dL) have little to gain from pravastatin."
"What is the best approach for managing recurrent bacterial vaginosis
To study how frequency, recentness, and reason for douching impact bacterial vaginosis-related vaginal microflora and the occurrence of cervical pathogens. Douching has been linked to bacterial vaginosis as well as to chlamydial cervicitis in some, but not all, studies. A total of 1200 women at high risk for sexually transmitted infections were enrolled from five clinical sites around the United States. Cross-sectional, structured interviews were conducted and vaginal swabs were self-obtained for Gram stain, culture, and DNA amplification tests for Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis. Douching at least once per month was associated with an increased frequency of bacterial vaginosis. Those who douched recently (within 7 days) were at highest risk [odds ratio (OR) 2.1, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.3, 3.1]. Douching for symptoms (OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.1, 2.6) and for hygiene (OR 1.3, 95% CI 1.0, 1.9) both related to bacterial vaginosis risk. The associations between douching and Gardnerella vaginalis, Mycoplasma hominis, and lack of hydrogen peroxide-producing lactobacilli were similar to those between douching and bacterial vaginosis. Gonococcal or chlamydial cervicitis was not associated with douching. Douching for symptoms or hygiene, particularly frequent or recent douching, was associated with bacterial vaginosis and bacterial vaginosis-associated vaginal microflora, but not with gonococcal or chlamydial cervicitis.","Douching is the best-studied risk factor for bacterial vaginosis. A recent multicenter cross-sectional study of 1200 women assessed douching practices and found that recent douching increased the risk of bacterial vaginosis twofold (odds ratio=2.1; 95% confidence interval, 1.3-3.1)."
"What are the most effective ways you can help patients stop smoking
Treating Tobacco Use and Dependence, a Public Health Service-sponsored Clinical Practice Guideline, is a product of the Tobacco Use and Dependence Guideline Panel (""the panel""), consortium representatives, consultants, and staff. These 30 individuals were charged with the responsibility of identifying effective, experimentally validated tobacco dependence treatments and practices. The updated guideline was sponsored by a consortium of seven Federal Government and nonprofit organizations: the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Cancer Institute (NCI), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institute on Drug Abuse, Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, and University of Wisconsin Medical School's Center for Tobacco Research and Intervention. This guideline is an updated version of the 1996 Smoking Cessation Clinical Practice Guideline No. 18 that was sponsored by the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (now the AHRQ), United States Department of Health and Human Services. The original guideline reflected the extant scientific research literature published between 1975 and 1994. The updated guideline was written because new, effective clinical treatments for tobacco dependence have been identified since 1994. The accelerating pace of tobacco research that prompted the update is reflected in the fact that 3,000 articles on tobacco were identified as published between 1975 and 1994, contributing to the original guideline. Another 3,000 were published between 1995 and 1999 and contributed to the updated guideline. These 6,000 articles were screened and reviewed to identify a much smaller group of articles that served as the basis for guideline data analyses and panel opinion. This guideline contains strategies and recommendations designed to assist clinicians, tobacco dependence treatment specialists, and health care administrators, insurers, and purchasers in delivering and supporting effective treatments for tobacco use and dependence. The recommendations were made as a result of a systematic review and analysis of the extant scientific literature, using meta-analysis as the primary analytic technique. The strength of evidence that served as the basis for each recommendation is clearly indicated in the guideline. A draft of the guideline was peer-reviewed prior to publication, and the comments of 70 external reviewers were incorporated into the final document. The key recommendations of the updated guideline, Treating Tobacco Use and Dependence, based on the literature review and expert panel opinion, are as follows: 1. Tobacco dependence is a chronic condition that often requires repeated intervention. However, effective treatments exist that can produce long-term or even permanent abstinence. 2. Because effective tobacco dependence treatments are available, every patient who uses tobacco should be offered at least one of these treatments: Patients willing to try to quit tobacco use should be provided with treatments identified as effective in this guideline. Patients unwilling to try to quit tobacco use should be provided with a brief intervention designed to increase their motivation to quit. 3. It is essential that clinicians and health care delivery systems (including administrators, insurers, and purchasers) institutionalize the consistent identification, documentation, and treatment of every tobacco user seen in a health care setting. 4. Brief tobacco dependence treatment is effective, and every patient who uses tobacco should be offered at least brief treatment. 5. There is a strong dose-response relation between the intensity of tobacco dependence counseling and its effectiveness. Treatments involving person-to-person contact (via individual, group, or proactive telephone counseling) are consistently effective, and their effectiveness increases with treatment intensity (eg, minutes of contact). 6. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)","The Cochrane review also concluded that all commercially available forms of nicotine replacement therapy are effective for smoking cessation. Also, recent studies have established no association between nicotine replacement therapy and further cardiac events."
"Is osteopathic manipulation effective for headaches
To compare the effectiveness of spinal manipulation and pharmaceutical treatment (amitriptyline) for chronic tension-type headache. Randomized controlled trial using two parallel groups. The study consisted of a 2-wk baseline period, a 6-wk treatment period and a 4-wk posttreatment, follow-up period. Chiropractic college outpatient clinic. One hundred and fifty patients between the ages of 18 and 70 with a diagnosis of tension-type headaches of at least 3 months' duration at a frequency of at least once per wk. 6 wk of spinal manipulative therapy provided by chiropractors or 6 wk of amitriptyline treatment managed by a medical physician. Change in patient-reported daily headache intensity, weekly headache frequency, over-the-counter medication usage and functional health status (SF-36). A total of 448 people responded to the recruitment advertisements; 298 were excluded during the screening process. Of the 150 patients who were enrolled in the study, 24 (16%) dropped out: 5 (6.6%) from the spinal manipulative therapy and 19 (27.1%) from the amitriptyline therapy group. During the treatment period, both groups improved at very similar rates in all primary outcomes. In relation to baseline values at 4 wk after cessation of treatment, the spinal manipulation group showed a reduction of 32% in headache intensity, 42% in headache frequency, 30% in over-the-counter medication usage and an improvement of 16% in functional health status. By comparison, the amitriptyline therapy group showed no improvement or a slight worsening from baseline values in the same four major outcome measures. Controlling for baseline differences, all group differences at 4 wk after cessation of therapy were considered to be clinically important and were statistically significant. Of the patients who finished the study, 46 (82.1%) in the amitriptyline therapy group reported side effects that included drowsiness, dry mouth and weight gain. Three patients (4.3%) in the spinal manipulation group reported neck soreness and stiffness. The results of this study show that spinal manipulative therapy is an effective treatment for tension headaches. Amitriptyline therapy was slightly more effective in reducing pain at the end of the treatment period but was associated with more side effects. Four weeks after the cessation of treatment, however, the patients who received spinal manipulative therapy experienced a sustained therapeutic benefit in all major outcomes in contrast to the patients that received amitriptyline therapy, who reverted to baseline values. The sustained therapeutic benefit associated with spinal manipulation seemed to result in a decreased need for over-the-counter medication. There is a need to assess the effectiveness of spinal manipulative therapy beyond four weeks and to compare spinal manipulative therapy to an appropriate placebo such as sham manipulation in future clinical trials.","Two trials investigated the efficacy of spinal manipulative therapy on tension-type headaches. The first, an randomized controlled trials with 150 patients with recurrent headaches, compared spinal manipulative therapy (2 sessions per week) with amitriptyline (10 mg daily week 1, 20 mg daily week 2, then 30 mg daily) for 6 weeks. At the end of 6 weeks, the spinal manipulative therapy group reported a nonsignificant trend toward more headache pain (ES for spinal manipulative therapy vs amitriptyline= -0.4; 95% CI, -0.8 to 0.0), but fewer side effects. They had similar headache frequency and medication use."
"Does neonatal circumcision decrease morbidity
We determined the relation between newborn circumcision and both invasive penile cancer (IPC) and carcinoma in situ (CIS) among adult male members of a large health maintenance organization. Circumcision status was ascertained by a combination of pathology reports, medical record review, and questionnaires for 213 adult male members of a large prepaid health plan who were diagnosed with IPC or CIS. Of 89 men with IPC whose circumcision status was known, 2 (2.3%) had been circumcised as newborns, and 87 were not circumcised. Of 118 men with CIS whose circumcision status was known, 16 (15.7%) had been circumcised as newborns. Our results confirm the highly protective effect of newborn circumcision against IPC and the less protective effect against CIS.","A meta-analysis of 15 observational studies in Africa, with adjustment for potential confounding factors, found that circumcision decreased the risk of acquiring HIV by more than half (relative risk [RR]=0.42; 95% CI, 0.34-0.54)."
"What treatments are safe and effective for mild to moderate hypertension in pregnancy
Mild to moderate hypertension during pregnancy is common. Antihypertensive drugs are often used in the belief that lowering blood pressure will prevent progression to more severe disease, and thereby improve outcome. To assess the effects of antihypertensive drug treatments for women with mild to moderate hypertension during pregnancy. We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (March 2006), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2005, Issue 3), MEDLINE (1966 to November 2005), LILACS (1984 to November 2005) and EMBASE (1974 to November 2005). All randomised trials evaluating any antihypertensive drug treatment for mild to moderate hypertension during pregnancy defined, whenever possible, as systolic blood pressure 140 to 169 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure 90 to 109 mmHg. Comparisons were of one or more antihypertensive drug(s) with placebo, with no antihypertensive drug, or with another antihypertensive drug, and where treatment was planned to continue for at least seven days. Two review authors independently extracted data. Forty-six trials (4282 women) were included. Twenty-eight trials compared an antihypertensive drug with placebo/no antihypertensive drug (3200 women). There is a halving in the risk of developing severe hypertension associated with the use of antihypertensive drug(s) (19 trials, 2409 women; relative risk (RR) 0.50; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.41 to 0.61; risk difference (RD) -0.10 (-0.12 to -0.07); number needed to treat (NNT) 10 (8 to 13)) but little evidence of a difference in the risk of pre-eclampsia (22 trials, 2702 women; RR 0.97; 95% CI 0.83 to 1.13). Similarly, there is no clear effect on the risk of the baby dying (26 trials, 3081 women; RR 0.73; 95% CI 0.50 to 1.08), preterm birth (14 trials, 1992 women; RR 1.02; 95 % CI 0.89 to 1.16), or small-for-gestational-age babies (19 trials, 2437 women; RR 1.04; 95 % CI 0.84 to 1.27). There were no clear differences in any other outcomes. Nineteen trials (1282 women) compared one antihypertensive drug with another. Beta blockers seem better than methyldopa for reducing the risk of severe hypertension (10 trials, 539 women, RR 0.75 (95 % CI 0.59 to 0.94); RD -0.08 (-0.14 to 0.02); NNT 12 (6 to 275)). There is no clear difference between any of the alternative drugs in the risk of developing proteinuria/pre-eclampsia. Other outcomes were only reported by a small proportion of studies, and there were no clear differences. It remains unclear whether antihypertensive drug therapy for mild to moderate hypertension during pregnancy is worthwhile.","In comparing one agent with another, methyldopa was the most commonly tested agent, with 14 randomized controlled trials of more than 1010 subjects demonstrating its efficacy at reducing blood pressure. Other antihypertensive agents appear better than methyldopa in terms of reducing the risk of infant mortality (RR=0.49; 95% CI, 0.24-0.99)."
"Does ambulatory blood pressure monitoring aid in the management of patients with hypertension
This study assessed the prognostic value of ambulatory vs. clinic blood pressure measurement in 688 hypertensives who had undergone pretreatment 24-hour intra-arterial ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. A total of 157 first events were recorded over a follow-up period of 9.2A+/-4.4 years. Ambulatory systolic or diastolic blood pressure parameters (whether 24-hour mean, daytime mean, or nighttime mean) or ambulatory pulse pressure provided independent prognostic information in conjunction with clinical variables. The most predictive models contained the ambulatory systolic blood pressure parameters. Age, male gender, South Asian origin, diabetes mellitus, and previous cardiovascular disease were additional independent predictors of events. In a subgroup of 295 uncomplicated patients, 24-hour ambulatory pulse pressure was an independent predictor of left ventricular mass index and maximal carotid intima-media thickness. Baseline clinic blood pressure parameters did not provide independent information for the prediction of events or target organ damage. Therefore, in this study, ambulatory blood pressure proved to be superior to clinic measurement for cardiovascular risk stratification. However, the routine use of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring is not currently recommended, mainly because of a lack of outcome trials based on the treatment of ambulatory blood pressure levels. (c)2001 by Le Jacq Communications, Inc.","When compared with standard office measurement, management with ambulatory blood pressure monitoring led to less intensive antihypertensive drug therapy without loss of blood pressure control. Evidence from these and other studies indicates that ambulatory blood pressure monitoring can be useful for risk stratification of patients in whom the diagnosis of hypertension is not clear."
"What are safe sleeping arrangements for infants
After striking changes in rates of sudden unexplained infant death (SIDS) around 1990, four large case-control studies were set up to re-examine the epidemiology of this syndrome. The European Concerted Action on SIDS (ECAS) investigation was planned to bring together data from these and new studies to give an overview of risk factors for the syndrome in Europe. We undertook case-control studies in 20 regions. Data for more than 60 variables were extracted from anonymised records of 745 SIDS cases and 2411 live controls. Logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) for every factor in isolation, and to construct multivariate models. Principal risk factors were largely independent. Multivariately significant ORs showed little evidence of intercentre heterogeneity apart from four outliers, which were eliminated. Highly significant risks were associated with prone sleeping (OR 13.1 [95% CI 8.51-20.2]) and with turning from the side to the prone position (45.4 [23.4-87.9]). About 48% of cases were attributable to sleeping in the side or prone position. If the mother smoked, significant risks were associated with bed-sharing, especially during the first weeks of life (at 2 weeks 27.0 [13.3-54.9]). This OR was partly attributable to mother's consumption of alcohol. Mother's alcohol consumption was significant only when baby bed-shared all night (OR increased by 1.66 [1.16-2.38] per drink). For mothers who did not smoke during pregnancy, OR for bed-sharing was very small (at 2 weeks 2.4 [1.2-4.6]) and only significant during the first 8 weeks of life. About 16% of cases were attributable to bed-sharing and roughly 36% to the baby sleeping in a separate room. Avoidable risk factors such as those associated with inappropriate infants' sleeping position, type of bedding used, and sleeping arrangements strongly suggest a basis for further substantial reductions in SIDS incidence rates.",A study on duvet use found it to be a risk factor for SIDS OR=1.82.
"What is the best treatment for gastroesophageal reflux and vomiting in infants
Paediatricians are familiar with infants complaining of regurgitation and emesis from gastrooesophageal reflux. These subjects, usually growing satisfactorily and healthy, are affected by ""functional"" or ""symptomatic"" gastrooesophagel reflux and are treated with posture changes and thickened feedings. To evaluate in infants with symptomatic gastrooesophageal reflux the effect of a new formula (Nutrilon AR), containing carob flour/locus bean gum as a thickening agent; both clinical features and oesophageal acid exposure were evaluated. Twenty-four infants (age range: 5-11 months; median age: 8 months; 8 females) presented at our Unit with a history of chronic postprandial regurgitation. During a 24-hour intraoesophageal pH test a traditional formula thickened with rice flour at a concentration of 5% was alternated with the formula Nutrilon AR; thereafter infants were randomly allocated to receive, for two weeks, either a traditional thickened formula or the new formula, in addition to posture changes. Intraoesophageal acid exposure was significantly lower in the periods following the new formula than after traditional formula; at the end of the treatment period patients receiving the new formula had a more significant decrease of both symptomatic score and number of episodes of emesis than patients on traditional formula. The new available formula, with the characteristics of a thickened meal, is better than a formula, traditionally thickened with added rice flour, in the conservative treatment of infants with symptomatic gastrooesophageal reflux.","An uncontrolled, comparative trial of carob bean gum vs rice cereal suggested superiority of carob bean gum as a thickener, although both treatments yielded improvement."
"Which drugs are safest for moderate to severe depression in adolescents
Concern exists that antidepressants can cause suicidality in youths with depression. To determine the pooled risk of self-harm and suicidal behaviour from randomised trials of newer antidepressants. A meta-analysis was carried out to calculate odds ratios for the combined data. Self-harm or suicide-related events occurred in 71 of 1487 (4.8%) of depressed youths treated with antidepressants v. 38 of 1254 (3.0%) of those given placebo (fixed effects odds ratio 1.70, 95% CI 1.13-2.54, P=0.01). There was a trend for individual suicidal thoughts, attempts and self-harm to occur more often in youths taking antidepressants than in those given placebo, but none of these differences was statistically significant. Antidepressants may cause a small short-term risk of self-harm or suicidal events in children and adolescents with major depressive disorder.","One analysis estimated the difference in risk to be 1.6-fold with a 95% CI of 1.0-2.7 (3% vs 2%; NNH=112). The lower estimated risk results largely from a statistical reframing rather than any major difference in data analyzed. The analyses used a random-effects model instead of a fixed-effects model to calculate suicidality, assuming heterogeneity in the drugs used, trial de-signs, and outcome measures. Notably, venlafaxine had the greatest - and only statistically significant - increased risk, mostly because of suicidal ideation (7 of 9 events in 182 treated patients vs none in 179 placebo patients)."
"Is therapy based on endoscopy results better than empiric therapy for dyspepsia
This review considers management strategies (combinations of initial investigation and empirical treatments) for dyspeptic patients. Dyspepsia was defined to include both epigastric pain and heartburn. To determine the effectiveness, acceptability, and cost effectiveness of the following initial management strategies for patients presenting with dyspepsia (a) initial pharmacological therapy (including endoscopy for treatment failures) (b) early endoscopy (c) testing for Helicobacter pylori and endoscope only those positive (d) H.pylori eradication therapy with or without prior testing. Trials were located through electronic searches and extensive contact with trialists. All randomised controlled trials of dyspeptic patients presenting in primary care. Data was collected on dyspeptic symptoms, quality of life and use of resources. Twenty papers reporting 23 comparisons were found. Trials comparing proton pump inhibitors (PPI) with antacids (two trials) and H2 receptor antagonists (three trials), early endoscopy with initial acid suppression (five trials), H.pylori 'test and scope' v usual management (three trials), H.pylori test and treat v. endoscopy (four trials), and test and treat v. acid suppression alone in H.pylori positive patients (two trials), were pooled. PPIs were significantly more effective than both H2RAs and antacids. Relative risks (RR) and 95% CI were, for PPI: antacid 0.72 (0.64-0.80), PPI: H2RA 0.63 (0.47-0.85). Results for other drug comparisons were either absent or inconclusive. Initial endoscopy was associated with a small reduction in the risk of recurrent dyspeptic symptoms compared with initial prescribing (RR 0.89 (0.77-1.02). H.pylori test and endoscopy increases costs in primary care, but does not improve symptoms. H.pylori test and eradicate may be as effective as endoscopy- based management and reduces costs, by decreasing the proportion of patients that are endoscoped. 'Test and treat' may be more effective than acid suppression alone, RR 0.59 (0.42-0.83). PPIs are effective in the treatment of dyspepsia in these trials which may not adequately exclude patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. The relative efficacy of H2RA and PPI is uncertain. Early investigation by endoscopy or H.pylori testing may benefit some patients with dyspepsia. The review will be updated in 2004 with an individual patient data meta-analysis of the economic data, and a subgroup analysis by age and predominant dyspeptic symptom.","A subgroup analysis reported on 3 RCTs from both primary and secondary settings with 931 patients comparing H pylori ""test and treat"" to initial endoscopy. It found no significant difference in symptom reduction (RR=1.06; 95% CI, 0.98-1.26)."
"What vitamins and minerals should be given to breastfed and bottle-fed infants
Widespread use of fluoride has been a major factor in the decline in the prevalence and severity of dental caries (i.e., tooth decay) in the United States and other economically developed countries. When used appropriately, fluoride is both safe and effective in preventing and controlling dental caries. All U.S. residents are likely exposed to some degree to fluoride, which is available from multiple sources. Both health-care professionals and the public have sought guidance on selecting the best way to provide and receive fluoride. During the late 1990s, CDC convened a work group to develop recommendations for using fluoride to prevent and control dental caries in the United States. This report includes these recommendations, as well as a) critical analysis of the scientific evidence regarding the efficacy and effectiveness of fluoride modalities in preventing and controlling dental caries, b) ordinal grading of the quality of the evidence, and c) assessment of the strength of each recommendation. Because frequent exposure to small amounts of fluoride each day will best reduce the risk for dental caries in all age groups, the work group recommends that all persons drink water with an optimal fluoride concentration and brush their teeth twice daily with fluoride toothpaste. For persons at high risk for dental caries, additional fluoride measures might be needed. Measured use of fluoride modalities is particularly appropriate during the time of anterior tooth enamel development (i.e., age <6 years). The recommendations in this report guide dental and other health-care providers, public health officials, policy makers, and the public in the use of fluoride to achieve maximum protection against dental caries while using resources efficiently and reducing the likelihood of enamel fluorosis. The recommendations address public health and professional practice, self-care, consumer product industries and health agencies, and further research. Adoption of these recommendations could further reduce dental caries in the United States and save public and private resources.",No infant under 6 months of age should receive fluoride supplementation to prevent dental caries because of the risk of enamel fluorosis.
"Are inhalers with spacers better than nebulizers for children with asthma
To evaluate the current literature about the efficacy of providing inhaled medications by metered-dose inhalers and accessory devices (MDI/ADs) to children with acute asthma and to compare it with the current standard of care, small-volume nebulizers (SVNs). Online computer and manual searches in English-language journal articles published between 1980 and 1996. Seventeen prospective clinical trials that have used MDI/ADs in the treatment of acute asthma in children were retrieved. Ten randomized controlled studies that included a comparison with SVN treatment were selected. Studies were assessed qualitatively by their subject characteristics, design, intervention procedures, outcome measures, and results. There were marked variations in types of MDI/ADs and in doses administered between and within studies. Major outcome measures included pulmonary function measurements and clinical scores. All studies found MDI/ADs to be effective in the treatment of infants and children with acute asthma. Among those who compared this treatment with SVN, 2 found the MDI/AD superior and the rest found it as effective as the SVN. The data support the effectiveness of MDI/ADs as first-line treatment in acute childhood asthma. In view of clinical benefit, safety, lower cost, personnel time, and speed and ease of administration of MDI/ADs compared with SVNs, MDI/ADs should be considered the preferred mode of treatment of children with acute asthma.","One article reviewed the literature from 1980 to 1996 and examined 17 prospective clinical trials. Outcomes measured included pulmonary function measures and clinical scores. The researchers recommended that metered dose inhaler spacer be used due to clinical benefit, safety, lower cost, personnel time, and speed and ease of administration."
"Should we screen women for hypothyroidism
To determine the natural course of the syndrome ""subclinical hypothyroidism."" Prospective study of 30 subjects with ""subclinical hypothyroidism,"" as documented precisely by normal serum thyroxine and triiodothyronine concentrations and high serum thyrotropin levels on three occasions at intervals of 2 to 3 weeks. The subjects were followed up for 4 to 15 years (mean, 8.2 +/- 2.3 years), with repeated determinations of thyroid hormone indices at intervals of 3 to 6 months. Endocrinology Clinic at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center. 16 subjects developed definitive primary hypothyroidism within 3 months to 2 years, as reflected by a progressive rise in serum thyrotropin level with a gradual decline in serum thyroxine and triiodothyronine concentrations, with serum thyroxine levels falling to subnormal concentrations. In 14 of these subjects, primary hypothyroidism could be attributed to known etiologic factors, whereas in the remaining two the cause was not apparent. Persistently elevated serum thyrotropin with normal serum thyroxine and triiodothyronine concentrations following a cyclic pattern was observed in 14 subjects during the follow-up period. In 11 of these subjects, there was a history of non-radical surgery or conventional radiation therapy to the neck area, whereas in the remaining three subjects, no apparent cause could be identified. ""Subclinical hypothyroidism"" is not always a forerunner of primary hypothyroidism. Two distinct populations evolve: (1) those with true preclinical or subclinical hypothyroidism, which may be predicted by the presence of one of the well-known etiologic factors responsible for onset of primary hypothyroidism, and (2) euthyroidism with reset thyrostat--a permanent state without a definitive progression to hypothyroidism, most probably secondary to a previous subtle insult to the thyroid gland.",A prospective study of 30 patients (6 women) with subclinical hypothyroidism found 16 (3 women) who progressed to overt disease within 24 months. The remaining patients maintained normal FT4 levels for at least 15 years despite persistently elevated TSH.
"Can we prevent splenic rupture for patients with infectious mononucleosis
Spontaneous splenic rupture is an extremely rare but life-threatening complication of infectious mononucleosis in young adults. Although splenectomy remains effective treatment, reports of successful nonoperative management have challenged the time-honored approach of emergent laparotomy. On retrospective analysis of our institutional experience with 8,116 patients who had this disease during a 40-year period, we found 5 substantiated cases of atraumatic splenic rupture due to infectious mononucleosis. Four additional cases of suspected splenic rupture were noted. All nine patients were hospitalized and treated (seven underwent splenectomy and two were treated with supportive measures only), and they remain alive and well. In patients with infectious mononucleosis suspected of having rupture of the spleen, a rapid but thorough assessment and prompt implementation of appropriate management should minimize the associated morbidity and mortality. On the basis of review of the medical literature and careful scrutiny of our own experience, we advocate emergent splenectomy for spontaneous splenic rupture in patients with infectious mononucleosis.","A retrospective analysis of 8116 patients with infectious mononucleosis at the Mayo Clinic estimated the risk of spontaneous splenic rupture to be 0.1% of cases, correlating with rates found in other studies. The study's criteria for definite spontaneous rupture are: no recent trauma; recent symptoms; hematologic, serologic, and histologic (splenic) evidence of infectious mononucleosis. Five patients with rupture (average age, 22) were identified; 3 were male. Splenectomy was performed for all patients. Follow-up over 33-years found all patients healthy with minimal subsequent illness."
"What behavioral interventions are safe and effective for treating obesity
The purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of a weight maintenance program conducted over the Internet. Longitudinal, clinical behavioral weight loss trial with 6-month in-person behavioral obesity treatment followed by a 12-month maintenance program conducted both in-person (frequent in-person support; F-IPS, minimal in-person support; M-IPS) and over the Internet (Internet support; IS). A total of 122 healthy, overweight adults (age=48.4+/-9.6, BMI=32.2+/-4.5 kg/m(2), 18 male) Body weight, dietary intake, energy expended in physical activity, attendance, self-monitoring, comfort with technology. Results (n=101) showed that weight loss did not differ by condition during treatment (8.0+/-5 vs 11+/-6.5 vs 9.8+/-5.9 kg, P=0.27 for IS, M-IPS and F-IPS, respectively). The IS condition gained significantly more weight than the F-IPS group during the first 6 months of weight maintenance (+2.2+/-3.8 vs 0+/-4 kg, P<0.05) and sustained a significantly smaller weight loss than both in-person support groups at the 1 y follow-up (-5.7+/-5.9 vs -10.4+/-9.3 vs -10.4+/-6.3 kg, P<0.05 for IS, M-IPS and F-IPS, respectively). Attendance at maintenance meetings was greater for the F-IPS than the IS condition over the 1 y maintenance program (54 vs 39%, P=0.04). Acceptability of assigned condition was higher for subjects in the F-IPS than IS condition. The results of this study suggest that Internet support does not appear to be as effective as minimal or frequent intensive in-person therapist support for facilitating the long-term maintenance of weight loss.","One randomized controlled trials addressed both behavioral therapy and the importance of face-to-face interaction. The study randomized 122 subjects to either Internet video sessions biweekly with a therapist which included behavioral therapy, access to an associated chat room and e-mail correspondence, or to biweekly face-to-face sessions with a therapist. The active intervention spanned 24 weeks, but the therapist met with the face-to-face group and interacted in the chat room and with e-mail for another 6 months. At 18 months, the mean weight loss in the Internet group was 5.7 kg compared with 10.4 kg in the face-to-face group."
"How should we follow athletes after a concussion
Approximately 300 000 sport-related concussions occur annually in the United States, and the likelihood of serious sequelae may increase with repeated head injury. To estimate the incidence of concussion and time to recovery after concussion in collegiate football players. Prospective cohort study of 2905 football players from 25 US colleges were tested at preseason baseline in 1999, 2000, and 2001 on a variety of measures and followed up prospectively to ascertain concussion occurrence. Players injured with a concussion were monitored until their concussion symptoms resolved and were followed up for repeat concussions until completion of their collegiate football career or until the end of the 2001 football season. Incidence of concussion and repeat concussion; type and duration of symptoms and course of recovery among players who were injured with a concussion during the seasons. During follow-up of 4251 player-seasons, 184 players (6.3%) had a concussion, and 12 (6.5%) of these players had a repeat concussion within the same season. There was an association between reported number of previous concussions and likelihood of incident concussion. Players reporting a history of 3 or more previous concussions were 3.0 (95% confidence interval, 1.6-5.6) times more likely to have an incident concussion than players with no concussion history. Headache was the most commonly reported symptom at the time of injury (85.2%), and mean overall symptom duration was 82 hours. Slowed recovery was associated with a history of multiple previous concussions (30.0% of those with > or =3 previous concussions had symptoms lasting >1 week compared with 14.6% of those with 1 previous concussion). Of the 12 incident within-season repeat concussions, 11 (91.7%) occurred within 10 days of the first injury, and 9 (75.0%) occurred within 7 days of the first injury. Our study suggests that players with a history of previous concussions are more likely to have future concussive injuries than those with no history; 1 in 15 players with a concussion may have additional concussions in the same playing season; and previous concussions may be associated with slower recovery of neurological function.","A large prospective cohort study of 2900 US college football players found that players with 1 previous concussion had a 40% increased risk of future concussion, and those with 3 previous concussions had a three-fold increase in risk."
"At what age do patients no longer need colorectal cancer screening
Faecal occult blood testing is routinely used for early detection of colorectal cancer, but evidence of its efficacy in preventing death from colorectal cancer is limited. A case-control study was carried out to evaluate whether screening for faecal occult blood is associated with a reduced risk of fatal colorectal cancer. A health maintenance organisation in western Washington State, which has offered its members faecal occult blood testing every two years since 1983. Cases (n = 248) were members of the health maintenance organisation who died from colorectal cancer between 1986 and 1991. For each case, two control subjects, who did not die from colorectal cancer and who were similar to each case in age, gender, and year of enrollment at the health maintenance organisation, were randomly selected from the membership list of the year in which the case was diagnosed (n = 496). Information about episodes of faecal occult blood testing (including the location and reason for the test, and the evaluation of positive tests) and potential confounders was obtained from medical records. Cases were less likely than controls to have ever been screened (odds ratio (OR) = 0.7, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.5 to 1.0), consistent with a beneficial impact of screening. There was little difference, however, for screening that had taken place within a three year period before diagnosis (OR = 0.9, 95% CI 0.6 to 1.2), the maximum interval during which most tumours ought to have been detectable by faecal occult blood testing. A reduction in risk was seen for home testing but not for office testing, and in individuals aged less than 75 but not in those aged 75 or older. Although most of the 21 controls with a positive faecal occult blood test underwent some additional testing, only five (24%) were evaluated with colonoscopy or air contrast barium enema. While there can be uncertainty as to whether specific faecal occult blood tests were performed as screening or diagnostic tests, those performed at home and in younger persons may be relatively less likely to be diagnostic tests that were misclassified as screening. Thus the modest reduced risk associated with faecal occult blood testing in these settings/persons may reflect genuine benefit. However, the presence of a reduced risk associated with a screening faecal occult blood test received in the past, well before a tumour or polyp might bleed enough to allow detection, is compatible with uncontrolled confounding. Interpretation is further complicated by the fact that a number of individuals in the study group who had positive test results underwent limited or no diagnostic testing. Thus our results should be interpreted with considerable caution.","One case control study of fecal occult blood test showed a significant reduction in risk of mortality from colorectal cancer for individuals younger than 75 years, but not for patients older than 75; however, confidence intervals were wide."
"Do OTC remedies relieve cough in acute URIs
Acute cough due to upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) is a common symptom. Non-prescription over-the-counter (OTC) medicines are frequently recommended as a first-line treatment, but there is little evidence as to whether these drugs are effective. To assess the effects of oral OTC cough preparations for acute cough. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2006, Issue 4); MEDLINE (January 1966 to January Week 1, 2007); EMBASE (January 1974 to January 2007); and the UK Department of Health National Research Register (June 2007). Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing oral OTC cough preparations with placebo in children and adults suffering from acute cough in ambulatory settings. We considered all cough outcomes and second outcomes of interest were adverse effects. Two review authors independently screened potentially relevant citations and independently extracted data and assessed study quality. Quantitative analysis was performed where appropriate. Twenty five trials (17 in adults, 8 in children) involving 3492 people (2876 adults and 616 children) were included. RESULTS OF STUDIES IN ADULTS: Six trials compared antitussives with placebo and had variable results. Two trials compared the expectorant, guaifenesin with placebo, one indicated significant benefit whereas the other did not. One trial found that a mucolytic reduced cough frequency and symptom scores. Two studies examined antihistamine-decongestant combinations and found conflicting results. Three studies compared other combinations of drugs with placebo and indicated some benefit in reducing cough symptoms. Three trials found antihistamines were no more effective than placebo in relieving cough symptoms. RESULTS OF STUDIES IN CHILDREN: Antitussives (two studies), antihistamines (two studies), antihistamine decongestants (two studies) and antitussive/bronchodilator combinations (one study) were no more effective than placebo. No studies using expectorants met our inclusion criteria. The results of one trial favoured active treatment with mucolytics over placebo. One trial tested two paediatric cough syrups and both preparations showed a 'satisfactory response' in 46% and 56% of children compared to 21% of children in the placebo group. There is no good evidence for or against the effectiveness of OTC medicines in acute cough. The results of this review have to be interpreted with caution due differences in study characteristics and quality. Studies often showed conflicting results with uncertainty regarding clinical relevance. Higher quality evidence is needed to determine the effectiveness of self-care treatments for acute cough.","The results of 2 guaifenesin trials were split. In a double-blinded randomized controlled trials of 239 adults, more patients taking guaifenesin reported decreased cough frequency and intensity (75% vs 31%; P<.01). However, another double-blinded randomized controlled trials of 65 patients found guaifenesin to be no more effective than placebo in reducing subjective cough frequency."
"Who should have colposcopy
The value of colposcopy and cytology in screening CIN was analyzed in a retrospective study of 1,504 patients treated at the Department of Gynecologic Oncology, National Institute of Oncology, Budapest from 1980 to 1991. The majority (1,451) of the patients were admitted for histological confirmation of atypical colposcopic and/or cytologic findings, and 53 women were treated for cervical repair. All women underwent either cervical excision or conization. Cytologic and colposcopic findings were compared with the histological results. Sensitivity and specificity rates of cytology were 47% and 77%, respectively. The corresponding figures for colposcopy were 87% and 15% and for cytology and colposcopy together, 96% and 14%. The low sensitivity of cytology suggests that as many as 50% of CIN lesions may be overlooked if cytology alone is used for screening, i.e. in 50% of CIN associated with abnormal colposcopy the cytology was negative. We found 194 asymptomatic patients with carcinoma in situ, 40 with microinvasive and 8 with frank invasive carcinoma. This finding emphasizes the importance of cervical cancer screening. Our data suggest that, with colposcopy as a screening tool, the rate of false-negative cytology can be significantly reduced. Clinical implications of the ""cytology-negative abnormal colposcopy and cytology-negative CIN"" have yet to be determined. The major drawback of primary colposcopy is its low specificity with the consequence of high false-positive rate and over-treatment in a substantial number of cases. To overcome the problem of low specificity, further studies are required to identify those atypical colposcopic changes that most likely represent CIN--and high-grade CIN in particular.","The primary role of colposcopy is to identify cervical lesions, allowing directed biopsies to identify invasive cancer or its precursors. Although colposcopy has been studied as a primary screening technique, issues of cost, accessibility, invasiveness, and low specificity severely limit its usefulness in this role."
"What is the recommended evaluation and treatment for elevated serum prolactin
Hyperprolactinemia is the most common endocrine disorder of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. While it can occur in men, it occurs more commonly in women. The prevalence of hyperprolactinemia ranges from 0.4% in an unselected normal adult population to as high as 9-17% in women with reproductive disorders. There are many possible causes of hyperprolactinemia, falling into three general categories: physiologic, pharmacologic and pathologic. When specific treatable underlying causes have been eliminated and in cases of severe hyperprolactinemia, the most likely cause is a prolactin (PRL)-secreting pituitary adenoma. Microadenomas should be treated medically, with a dopamine agonist, if there is an indication for therapy (such as amenorrhea, infertility or bothersome galactorrhea). If there is no indication for therapy, microadenomas may be followed conservatively, as growth is uncommon. Macroadenomas may grow larger; medical therapy is recommended initially, with neurosurgical evaluation reserved for specific clinical situations, such as failure of medical therapy and evidence of mass effect despite medical therapy. In the United States, the dopamine agonists indicated for treatment of hyperprolactinemia are bromocriptine and cabergoline. Bromocriptine is usually given once or twice daily, while cabergoline has a long duration of action and is given once or twice weekly. Results of comparative studies indicate that cabergoline is clearly superior to bromocriptine in efficacy (PRL suppression, restoration of gonadal function) and tolerability.","Surgery is indicated for patients unresponsive to or intolerant of medical therapy, or who have visual field loss, cranial nerve palsy, or headache due to macroadenoma."
"What nonpharmacological treatments are effective against common nongenital warts
The clinical management of verrucae vulgaris is often challenging, and no ideal treatment currently exists. Early studies suggested that pulsed-dye laser (PDL) therapy might be highly effective in the treatment of verrucae, although more recent reports have been less optimistic. Previous studies have been retrospective or have consisted of a series of patients treated with PDL alone. Our objective was to prospectively evaluate the efficacy of PDL therapy versus conventional therapy with liquid nitrogen cryotherapy or cantharidin in the treatment of warts. Forty healthy adult patients with verrucae were randomized to receive either PDL (585 nm) therapy or conventional therapy. All enrollees also performed home therapy. Patients were eligible for up to 4 treatment sessions at 1-month intervals. Warts were individually counted and measured at the time of each treatment session. Complete response was defined as complete absence of verrucae with the presence of dermatoglyphics, and partial response was defined as a 50% or greater reduction in wart size. A total of 194 warts were evaluated by the conclusion of the study. Complete response was noted in an average of 70% of the warts treated with conventional therapy and in 66% of those in the PDL group; this was statistically insignificant. Partial response was observed in an average of 82% of the warts in patients treated with conventional therapy and 87% in the PDL group. Verruca vulgaris responded more readily than verruca plantaris in both treatment groups. The mean number of treatments to achieve success was similar in both groups. The PDL is an efficacious form of therapy for verrucae, as is conventional therapy. PDL therapy should be considered among the better established approaches in the treatment of warts, although data from this trial suggest that this approach is probably not superior.","Although pulsed dye laser has efficacy in various studies, no evidence favors it over cryotherapy or cantharidin. Treatment with CO2 laser and Er:Yag laser had an efficacy of 52% to 100%. However, many of these studies were small, poorly randomized, and had no placebo control."
"What does the evidence tell us about treating very-high-risk patients to an low density lipoprotein <70 mg/dL
The purpose of this study was to conduct a meta-analysis that compares the reduction of cardiovascular outcomes with high-dose statin therapy versus standard dosing. Debate exists regarding the merit of more intensive lipid lowering with high-dose statin therapy as compared with standard-dose therapy. We searched PubMed and article references for randomized controlled trials of intensive versus standard-dose statin therapy enrolling more than 1,000 patients with either stable coronary heart disease or acute coronary syndromes. Four trials were identified: the TNT (Treating to New Targets) and the IDEAL (Incremental Decrease in End Points Through Aggressive Lipid-Lowering) trials involved patients with stable cardiovascular disease, and the PROVE IT-TIMI-22 (Pravastatin or Atorvastatin Evaluation and Infection Therapy-Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction-22) and A-to-Z (Aggrastat-to-Zocor) trials involved patients with acute coronary syndromes. We carried out a meta-analysis of the relative odds on the basis of a fixed-effects model using the Mantel-Haenszel method for the major outcomes of death and cardiovascular events. A total of 27,548 patients were enrolled in the 4 large trials. The combined analysis yielded a significant 16% odds reduction in coronary death or myocardial infarction (p < 0.00001), as well as a significant 16% odds reduction of coronary death or any cardiovascular event (p < 0.00001). No difference was observed in total or non-cardiovascular mortality, but a trend toward decreased cardiovascular mortality (odds reduction 12%, p = 0.054) was observed. Intensive lipid lowering with high-dose statin therapy provides a significant benefit over standard-dose therapy for preventing predominantly non-fatal cardiovascular events.",A meta-analysis concluded that intensive lipid lowering with high-dose statin therapy confers a significant benefit over standard-dose therapy for preventing predominantly nonfatal cardiovascular events.
"What hormonal contraception is most effective for obese wome
The use-effectiveness of an intrauterine contraceptive device releasing 20 mcg of levonorgestrel daily (Lng-IUD), and of a Nova T copper-releasing IUD, were studied in a randomized, comparative multicenter trial. The Lng-IUD was inserted in 1821, and the Nova T in 937 women. The 12-month net pregnancy rate with the Lng-IUD (0.1 per hundred women) was significantly lower than that with the Nova T (0.9 per hundred). Removal rates for menstrual problems and/or pain were similar for the two methods (net rates 7.5 and 8.7, respectively). The 12-month continuation rates were 82.2 for the Nova T and 79.7 for the Lng-IUD. The reduction of the bleeding led to oligomenorrhea and amenorrhea in users of the Lng-IUD; the removal rate for these reasons was 1.4. The removal rate for hormonal side effects with the Lng-IUD was 2.4. Blood hemoglobin concentrations increased among users of the Lng-IUD and decreased among users of the Nova T. The results show that the Lng-IUD was a highly effective contraceptive method which reduced menstrual bleeding. It is a promising alternative for women desiring a highly effective method for long-term use. The use-effectiveness of an intrauterine contraceptive device releasing 20 mcg of levon ISZ orgestrel daily (Lng-IUD), and of a Nova T copper-releasing IUD, were studied in a randomized comparative mulicenter trial.

"In menopausal women, does fatigue indicate disease
Although fatigue is one of the most common complaints in ambulatory care, research has been minimal. Of the 1159 consecutive patients surveyed in two adult primary-care clinics, 276 (24%) indicated that fatigue was a major problem. Fatigue was more prevalent in women than in men (28% vs 19%). Extensive clinical, laboratory, psychometric, and functional data were gathered for 102 fatigued patients and 26 controls. Laboratory testing was not useful in detecting unsuspected medical conditions or in determining the cause of fatigue. Depression or somatic anxiety or both were suggested by screening psychometric instruments in 82 fatigued patients (80%) compared with three controls (12%). Global dysfunction was marked, as reported by patients on the Sickness Impact Profile. The mean score on the Sickness Impact Profile of 11.3 for fatigued patients is similar to that reported for patients with major medical illnesses. After one year of follow-up, only 29 fatigued patients (28%) had improved. The high prevalence, persistence, and functional consequences of fatigue mandate a search for effective therapy.","A prospective cohort study, using a 1-page questionnaire that included 2 fatigue scales, identified 276 (24%) of 1159 primary care patients who indicated fatigue as a major problem. The mean age of patients was 57 years and 66% were women. Extensive laboratory testing was not helpful in determining the cause of fatigue. The Beck Depression Inventory, the Modified Somatic Perception Questionnaire, and the Social Readjustment Rating Scale identified depression or anxiety in 80% of patients with fatigue and 12% of controls. There are no similar studies for strictly menopausal women."
"What is the most effective management of acute fractures of the base of the fifth metatarsal
There is considerable variability in the literature concerning the optimal treatment of acute Jones fractures. Early surgical fixation of acute Jones fractures will result in shorter times to union and return to athletics compared with cast treatment. Randomized controlled clinical trial; Level of evidence, 1. Eighteen patients were randomized to cast treatment, and 19 patients were randomized to screw fixation. Success of treatment and the times to union and return to sports were calculated for each patient. Mean follow-up was 25.3 months (range, 15-42 months). Eight of 18 (44%) in the cast group were considered treatment failures: 5 nonunions, 1 delayed union, and 2 refractures. One of 19 patients in the surgery group was considered a treatment failure. For the surgery group, the median times to union and return to sports were 7.5 and 8.0 weeks, respectively. For the cast group, the median times were 14.5 and 15.0 weeks, respectively. The Mann-Whitney test showed a statistically significant difference between the groups in both parameters, with P < 001. There is a high incidence (44%) of failure after cast treatment of acute Jones fractures. Early screw fixation results in quicker times to union and return to sports compared with cast treatment.","The rates and times of union with short leg casting vary over a wide range in the research literature. The casting group in the randomized controlled trials above had union rates of 56% and median time to union of 14.5 weeks (lower and upper quartile range, 10.5-18.5)."
"Do acetaminophen and an nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs combined relieve osteoarthritis pain better than either alone
In a double-blind study of 18 patients with coxarthrosis the effect of 3 naproxen doses (0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 g daily) and 2 naproxen doses combined with paracetamol (0.5 g + 4 g daily and 1.0 g + 4 g daily) was investigated. Plasma levels of naproxen and paracetamol were measured (HPLC), and clinical assessment of pain, joint movement, activity of daily life and side-effects were performed at the end of the 5 treatment periods. A relationship was found between the 3 naproxen doses, naproxen plasma levels, pain at rest, and pain during movement. The combined treatment was more effective than treatment with the same naproxen dose alone. The effect of naproxen (0.5 g daily) combined with paracetamol (4 g daily) did not differ from that obtained during treatment with higher naproxen doses only. Furthermore, the effect of the highest naproxen dose was not better than the effect of the lower naproxen dose (1.0 g daily) combined with paracetamol. The main finding was that treatment with naproxen and paracetamol is more effective than treatment with higher naproxen doses alone.","One double-blind, double-dummy crossover trial of 18 patients with osteoarthritis of the hip compared naproxen at doses of 500 mg and 1000 mg, with and without 4 g/d of acetaminophen, and 1500 mg/d of naproxen alone over 5 one-week trial periods. Adding acetaminophen improved patient-reported pain scores compared with naproxen alone. Higher doses of naproxen alone provided less pain relief than a lower dose of naproxen combined with acetaminophen. gastrointestinal side effects increased with the increase in naproxen dose, but were unaffected by the addition of acetaminophen. Functional ability was not affected during this short study. A similar study by the same researchers of patients with rheumatoid arthritis found similar results."
"What test is the best for diagnosing infectious mononucleosis
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infectious mononucleosis is often diagnosed based on characteristic clinical features and either a positive heterophil antibody test or serology, both of which can be unreliable in young children. Real time quantitative PCR assays that measure EBV DNA load in serum or plasma are highly sensitive in young children, but serum and plasma contain inhibitors of PCR which must be removed by DNA extraction techniques. A real time TaqMan PCR assay was designed and evaluated for simultaneously measuring EBV DNA load and validating the removal of PCR inhibitors from serum samples. A serum sample was available from patients classified serologically as primary EBV infection (n = 28), EBV-seronegative (n = 25) and EBV-seropositive (n = 26). Patients were classified as having EBV infectious mononucleosis if they had specified clinical findings and > or =10% atypical lymphocytes in peripheral blood or had a positive Monospot test result. DNA was purified by a spin column method and tested in PCR reactions with primers for EBV DNA polymerase gene and internal control targets. Amplification of the two PCR products was measured in real time with separate TaqMan DNA probes labeled with various fluorescent reporters. The mean age of study patients was 9 years, 4 months. Twenty-one (75%) of the patients in the primary EBV infection group, one (4%) of the seronegatives and none of the seropositives had detectable EBV DNA. Within the primary infection group, those with detectable virus were more likely than those without detectable virus to have evidence of lymphadenopathy (14 of 16 vs.1 of 5; P = 0.011), higher mean atypical (11.7 vs.0.9%; P = 0.002) and absolute atypical (1.5 vs.0.1 x 109/l; P = 0.004) lymphocyte count, higher mean absolute lymphocyte count (4.7 vs.2.3 x 109/l; P = 0.026) and higher mean aspartate aminotransferase value (119.8 vs.37.3 IU/l; P = 0.036). Ten patients, all in the primary infection group, had EBV infectious mononucleosis, and all had positive PCR results. No sample contained PCR inhibitors. A real time TaqMan PCR assay allows rapid identification of patients with primary EBV infection and those with EBV infectious mononucleosis.","Another validating cohort study evaluated PCR testing for epstein-barr virus deoxyribonucleic acid among children (average age 9 years, 4 months), 28 with infectious mononucleosis, 25 who were epstein-barr virus seronegative, and 26 who were seropositive. Children with acute infectious mononucleosis were diagnosed by symptoms, >10% atypical lymphocytes, and a positive heterophile antibody test. The PCR found a sensitivity and specificity of 75% and 98% at 1 week. Testing earlier, especially in children, is expected to decrease the sensitivity due to the lower maturity of the immune system response."
"What's the best drug treatment for premature ejaculation
Premature ejaculation has generally been considered a psychosexual disorder with psychogenic aetiology. Although still mainly treated by behavioural therapy, in recent years double-blind studies have indicated the beneficial effects of some of the serotonergic antidepressants (SSRIs) in delaying ejaculation. We describe here the neurophysiology and the peripheral neuroanatomy of ejaculation and provide a review of the involvement of serotonin in the central nervous system in relation to serotonergic nuclei and their projections. A hypothesis of the role of 5-HT1A and 5-HT2C receptors in premature ejaculation is postulated.","It's been suggested that lifelong premature ejaculation is a neurobiological phenomenon related to decreased central serotonergic neurotransmission, 5-HT2c receptor hyposensitivity, or 5-HT1a receptor hypersensitivity."
"Do statins reduce the risk of stroke
Previous overviews suggested that hydroxymethyl glutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins), but not other lipid-lowering therapy (LLT), may reduce stroke incidence in coronary patients. To investigate the amplitude and sources of heterogeneity of LLT effects on stroke prevention. We searched the literature from 1966 to 2001 and then conducted a meta-analysis including randomized trials of primary and secondary coronary heart disease prevention, testing statins, nonstatin drugs, diet, or other interventions and providing data on stroke incidence. The meta-analysis (38 trials, 83 161 patients, mean follow-up of 4.7 years) showed a significant relative risk reduction (RRR) of strokes by LLT of 17% (P<.001), without significant heterogeneity between trials and between subgroups according to either the type of prevention (primary or secondary) or the type of LLT. The most substantial effects were obtained, however, with statins (RRR, 26%). Effect model analysis showed that treatment benefit appeared constant whatever the risk of stroke, suggesting that LLT may be effective in a population with a higher risk of stroke. Weighted regression showed a significant correlation between RRR of stroke and total cholesterol levels (baseline, final, and change). Only final cholesterol allowed clear separation between benefit (RRR>0) and no effect (RRR<0) of LLT on stroke incidence, with a cutoff for benefit of 232 mg/dL (6.0 mmol/L). Lipid-lowering therapy reduces stroke incidence in coronary patients, especially when total cholesterol level is lowered to less than 232 mg/dL (6.0 mmol/L), which explains the best results being obtained with statins.",Statins did not reduce the rate of hemorrhagic stroke or fatal strokes.
"How effective are hypertension self-care interventions
Changes in population diet are likely to reduce cardiovascular disease and cancer, but the effect of dietary advice is uncertain. To assess the effects of providing dietary advice to achieve sustained dietary changes or improved cardiovascular risk profile among healthy adults. We searched the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register on The Cochrane Library (Issue 2 2000), MEDLINE (January 1966 to December 2000), EMBASE (January 1985 to December 2000), DARE (December 2000), CAB Health (December 1999), dissertation abstracts, and reference lists of articles. We contacted researchers in the field. Randomised studies with no more than 20% loss to follow-up, lasting at least three months involving healthy adults comparing dietary advice with no advice or less intensive advice. Trials involving children, trials to reduce weight or those involving supplementation were excluded. Two reviewers independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Study authors were contacted for additional information. Twenty-three trials with 29 intervention arms (comparisons) comparing dietary advice with no advice were included in the review. Dietary advice reduced total serum cholesterol by 0.13 mmol/l (95% CI 0.03 to 0.23) and LDL cholesterol by 0.13 mmol/l (95% CI 0.01 to 0.25) after 3-12 months. Mean HDL cholesterol levels were unchanged. Dietary advice reduced blood pressure by 2.10 mmHg systolic (95% CI 1.37 to 2.83) and 1.63 mmHg diastolic (95% CI 0.56 to 2.71) and 24-hour urinary sodium excretion by 44.2 mmol (95% CI 33.6 to 54.7) after 3-36 months. Plasma triglycerides, ss-carotene and red cell folate were each measured in one small study which suggested no significant effect. Self-reported dietary intake may be subject to reporting bias, and there was significant heterogeneity in all the following analyses. Compared to no advice, dietary advice increased fruit and vegetable intake by 1.24 servings/day (95% CI 0.43 to 2.05). Dietary fibre intake increased with advice by 7.22 g/day (95% CI 2.84 to 11.60), while total dietary fat as a percentage of total energy intake fell by 6.18 % (95% CI 4.00 to 8.36) with dietary advice and saturated fat intake fell by 3.28 % (95% CI 1.92 to 4.64). Dietary advice appears to be effective in bringing about modest beneficial changes in diet and cardiovascular risk factors over approximately 9 months but longer term effects are not known.","A Cochrane review of dietary advice for reducing cardiovascular disease risk among healthy adults included 29 trials. Individuals or groups of patients received verbal or printed dietary advice over 1 or more personal contacts. They also received advice by telephone. Ten RCTs of dietary advice in 4328 participants or groups of participants assessed self-reported dietary fat intake. Overall, intake of dietary fat (expressed as a percentage of total caloric intake) fell by 6.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], reduced 8.4% to increased 4.0%) with dietary intervention over 6 to 48 months. Due to significant heterogeneity between the studies, this overall estimate must be viewed with caution. Eight randomized controlled trials studies in 3952 participants or groups of participants assessed self-reported fruit and vegetable intake as an outcome. Overall, intake of fruits and vegetables increased by 1.2 servings per day (95% CI, 0.43-2.1) with interventions over 6 to 48 months. Again, there was significant heterogeneity between the studies. Therefore, this overall estimate must be viewed with caution. In general, the quality of the studies included in this systematic review was low due to poor descriptions of randomization, lack of allocation concealment, and lack of blinding of outcome assessment. The use of food frequency questionnaires to measure fat and fruit/vegetable intake likely led to reporting bias in these dietary intervention studies. Also, the trials were in healthy adults and not specific to hypertensive patients."
"What is the best approach to prevention and treatment of osteoporosis
Despite its association with disability, death, and increased medical costs, osteoporosis in men has been relatively neglected as a subject of study. There have been no large, controlled trials of treatment in men. In a two-year double-blind trial, we studied the effect of 10 mg of alendronate or placebo, given daily, on bone mineral density in 241 men (age, 31 to 87 years; mean, 63) with osteoporosis. Approximately one third had low serum free testosterone concentrations at base line; the rest had normal concentrations. Men with other secondary causes of osteoporosis were excluded. All the men received calcium and vitamin D supplements. The main outcome measures were the percent changes in lumbar-spine, hip, and total-body bone mineral density. The men who received alendronate had a mean (+/-SE) increase in bone mineral density of 7.1+/-0.3 percent at the lumbar spine, 2.5+/-0.4 percent at the femoral neck, and 2.0+/-0.2 percent for the total body (P<0.001 for all comparisons with base line). In contrast, men who received placebo had an increase in lumbar-spine bone mineral density of 1.8+/-0.5 percent (P<0.001 for the comparison with base line) and no significant changes in femoral-neck or total-body bone mineral density. The increase in bone mineral density in the alendronate group was greater than that in the placebo group at all measurement sites (P<0.001). The incidence of vertebral fractures was lower in the alendronate group than in the placebo group (0.8 percent vs. 7.1 percent, P=0.02). Men in the placebo group had a 2.4-mm decrease in height, as compared with a decrease of 0.6 mm in the alendronate group (P=0.02). Alendronate was generally well tolerated. In men with osteoporosis, alendronate significantly increases spine, hip, and total-body bone mineral density and helps prevent vertebral fractures and decreases in height.",One alendronate trial in 241 osteoporotic men demonstrated increased spine and hip bone mineral density and a decreased incidence of vertebral fractures.
"Are steroid injections effective for tenosynovitis of the hand
This retrospective study compares two methods used to treat de Quervain's disease: splintage with oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and steroid injection. Patients were separated into three groups based on symptom severity: group I-minimal, group II-mild, and group III-moderate or severe. Three hundred and nineteen wrists in 300 patients were followed from one to six years. Fifteen of 17 patients with minimal symptoms were relieved with splintage and NSAIDs. However, only seven of 20 in Group II and two of eight in Group III treated similarly were relieved. Of the 249 patients in Group III treated with injections, 76% were completely relieved, 7% were improved, and 4% were not improved. We conclude that classification of patients' with de Quervain's disease based on their pre-treatment symptoms may assist surgeons in selecting the most efficacious treatment and in providing prognostic information to their patients.","A retrospective study compared steroid injection with splinting and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Researchers stratified subjects into minimal, mild, or moderate-to-severe, based on their severity of disease and limitation on their activities of daily living. Mean follow-up was 2.3 years. Of those cases treated with splinting and NSAIDs, 15 of 17 in the minimal group had resolution of symptoms, but only 4 of 20 in the mild group and 2 of 8 in the moderate-to-severe group had symptoms resolve. The injection group obtained better results, with 100% of cases in the minimal and mild groups resolving and 76% of those in the more severe group resolving completely, with an additional 7% reporting improvement."
"What is the recommended workup for a man with a first urinary tract infection
Various types of urinary tract infection (UTI) occur in men. In this study we examined health care use trends, including epidemiological and economic factors, for UTI in men in the United States. The analytical methods used to generate these results have been described previously. Approximately 20% of all UTIs occur in men. Between 1988 and 1994 the overall lifetime prevalence of UTI was estimated to be 13,689/100,000 men. Orchitis rates, particularly in older men, are generally higher than those of cystitis or pyelonephritis. Approximately 10% of all inpatient care of men with UTI is for orchitis (12 to 14/100,000 population). Rates of outpatient hospital and physician office care for male UTI have increased in the last decade. Rates for emergency room care for UTI in elderly men (85 to 94 years old) were almost twice those in men younger than 85 years. The adjusted mean health care expenditure for privately insured men with UTI was 5,544 dollars in 1999 compared to 2,715 dollars for men without UTI. Total annual health care expenditures for men and women with UTI were 5,544 dollars and 5,407 dollars, respectively. Mean time lost from work was slightly higher for men. Based on composite data overall medical expenditures for men with UTI in the United States were estimated to be approximately 1.028 billion dollars in 2000. Health care use and economic data on UTIs in men revealed a number of intriguing trends. These results raise various important questions for future research.",The lifetime of urinary tract infection prevalence is about 14%.
"Does heat or cold work better for acute muscle strain
REFERENCE: Bleakley C, McDonough S, MacAuley D. The use of ice in the treatment of acute soft-tissue injury: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials. Am J Sport Med. 2004; 32:251-261. CLINICAL QUESTION: What is the clinical evidence base for cryotherapy use? DATA SOURCES: Studies were identified by using a computer-based literature search on a total of 8 databases: MEDLINE, Proquest, ISI Web of Science, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health (CINAHL) on Ovid, Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED) on Ovid, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness, and Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (Central). This was supplemented with citation tracking of relevant primary and review articles. Search terms included surgery,orthopaedics,sports injury,soft tissue injury,sprains and strains,contusions,athletic injury,acute,compression, cryotherapy,ice,RICE, andcold. STUDY SELECTION: To be included in the review, each study had to fulfill the following conditions: be a randomized, controlled trial of human subjects; be published in English as a full paper; include patients recovering from acute soft tissue or orthopaedic surgical interventions who received cryotherapy in inpatient, outpatient, or home-based treatment, in isolation or in combination with placebo or other therapies; provide comparisons with no treatment, placebo, a different mode or protocol of cryotherapy, or other physiotherapeutic interventions; and have outcome measures that included function (subjective or objective), pain, swelling, or range of motion. DATA EXTRACTION: The study population, interventions, outcomes, follow-up, and reported results of the assessed trials were extracted and tabulated. The primary outcome measures were pain, swelling, and range of motion. Only 2 groups reported adequate data for return to normal function. All eligible articles were rated for methodologic quality using the PEDro scale. The PEDro scale is a checklist that examines the believability (internal validity) and the interpretability of trial quality. The 11-item checklist yields a maximum score of 10 if all criteria are satisfied. The intraclass correlation coefficient and kappa values are similar to those reported for 3 other frequently used quality scales (Chalmers Scale, Jadad Scale, and Maastricht List). Two reviewers graded the articles, a method that has been reported to be more reliable than one evaluator. MAIN RESULTS: Specific search criteria identified 55 articles for review, of which 22 were eligible randomized, controlled clinical trials. The articles' scores on the PEDro scale were low, ranging from 1 to 5, with an average score of 3.4. Five studies provided adequate information on the subjects' baseline data, and only 3 studies concealed allocation during subject recruitment. No studies blinded their therapist's administration of therapy, and just 1 study blinded subjects. Only 1 study included an intention-to-treat analysis. The average number of subjects in the studies was 66.7; however, only 1 group undertook a power analysis. The types of injuries varied widely (eg, acute or surgical). No authors investigated subjects with muscle contusions or strains, and only 5 groups studied subjects with acute ligament sprains. The remaining 17 groups examined patients recovering from operative procedures (anterior cruciate ligament repair, knee arthroscopy, lateral retinacular release, total knee and hip arthroplasties, and carpal tunnel release). Additionally, the mode of cryotherapy varied widely, as did the duration and frequency of cryotherapy application. The time period when cryotherapy was applied after injury ranged from immediately after injury to 1 to 3 days postinjury. Adequate information on the actual surface temperature of the cooling device was not provided in the selected studies. Most authors recorded outcome variables over short periods (1 week), with the longest reporting follow-ups of pain, swelling, and range of motion recorded at 4 weeks postinjury. Data in that study were insufficient to calculate effect size. Nine studies did not provide data of the key outcome measures, so individual study effect estimates could not be calculated. A total of 12 treatment comparisons were made. Ice submersion with simultaneous exercises was significantly more effective than heat and contrast therapy plus simultaneous exercises at reducing swelling. Ice was reported to be no different from ice and low-frequency or high-frequency electric stimulation in effect on swelling, pain, and range of motion. Ice alone seemed to be more effective than applying no form of cryotherapy after minor knee surgery in terms of pain, but no differences were reported for range of motion and girth. Continuous cryotherapy was associated with a significantly greater decrease in pain and wrist circumference after surgery than intermittent cryotherapy. Evidence was marginal that a single simultaneous treatment with ice and compression is no more effective than no cryotherapy after an ankle sprain. The authors reported ice to be no more effective than rehabilitation only with regard to pain, swelling, and range of motion. Ice and compression seemed to be significantly more effective than ice alone in terms of decreasing pain. Additionally, ice, compression, and a placebo injection reduced pain more than a placebo injection alone. Lastly, in 8 studies, there seemed to be little difference in the effectiveness of ice and compression compared with compression alone. Only 2 of the 8 groups reported significant differences in favor of ice and compression. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the available evidence, cryotherapy seems to be effective in decreasing pain. In comparison with other rehabilitation techniques, the efficacy of cryotherapy has been questioned. The exact effect of cryotherapy on more frequently treated acute injuries (eg, muscle strains and contusions) has not been fully elucidated. Additionally, the low methodologic quality of the available evidence is of concern. Many more high-quality studies are required to create evidence-based guidelines on the use of cryotherapy. These must focus on developing modes, durations, and frequencies of ice application that will optimize outcomes after injury.",A comprehensive review of the literature revealed no studies that compare heat and cryotherapy to treat acute soft-tissue injury. Well-designed human trials of general management of acute soft-tissue injury are rare.
"What is the best way to diagnose a suspected rotator cuff tear
To evaluate the evidence for the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the newer diagnostic imaging tests as an addition to clinical examination and patient history for the diagnosis of soft tissue shoulder disorders. Literature was identified from several sources including general medical databases. Studies were identified that evaluated clinical examination, ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or magnetic resonance arthrography (MRA) in patients suspected of having soft tissue shoulder disorders. Outcomes assessed were clinical impingement syndrome or rotator cuff tear (full, partial or any). Only cohort studies were included. The methodological quality of included test accuracy studies was assessed using a formal quality assessment tool for diagnostic studies and the extraction of study findings was conducted in duplicate using a pre-designed and piloted data extraction form to avoid any errors. For each test, sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative likelihood ratios with 95% confidence intervals were calculated for each study. Where possible pooled estimates of sensitivity, specificity and likelihood ratios were calculated using random effects methods. Potential sources of heterogeneity were investigated by conducting subgroup analyses. In the included studies, the prevalence of rotator cuff disorders was generally high, partial verification of patients was common and in many cases patients who were selected retrospectively because they had undergone the reference test. Sample sizes were generally very small. Reference tests were often inappropriate with many studies using arthrography alone, despite problems with its sensitivity. For clinical assessment, 10 cohort studies were found that examined either the accuracy of individual tests or clinical examination as a whole: individual tests were either good at ruling out rotator cuff tears when negative (high sensitivity) or at ruling in such disorders when positive (high specificity), but small sample sizes meant that there was no conclusive evidence. Ultrasound was investigated in 38 cohort studies and found to be most accurate when used for the detection of full-thickness tears; sensitivity was lower for detection of partial-thickness tears. For MRI, 29 cohort studies were included. For full-thickness tears, overall pooled sensitivities and specificities were fairly high and the studies were not statistically heterogeneous; however for the detection of partial-thickness rotator cuff tears, the pooled sensitivity estimate was much lower. The results from six MRA studies suggested that it may be very accurate for detection of full-thickness rotator cuff tears, although its performance for the detection of partial-thickness tears was less consistent. Direct evidence for the performance of one test compared with another is very limited. The results suggest that clinical examination by specialists can rule out the presence of a rotator cuff tear, and that either MRI or ultrasound could equally be used for detection of full-thickness rotator cuff tears, although ultrasound may be better at picking up partial tears. Ultrasound also may be more cost-effective in a specialist hospital setting for identification of full-thickness tears. Further research suggestions include the need for large, well-designed, prospective studies of the diagnosis of shoulder pain, in particular a follow-up study of patients with shoulder pain in primary care and a prospective cohort study of clinical examination, ultrasound and MRI, alone and/or in combination.","Magnetic resonance arthrography (MRA), based on 6 cohort studies, may be accurate in the diagnosis of a full-thickness tear, with a sensitivity of 0.95 (95% CI, 0.82-0.98) and specificity of 0.93 (95% CI, 0.84-0.97). In these studies, diagnosis of partial-thickness tears with magnetic resonance arthrography was inconsistent. The invasiveness of magnetic resonance arthrography limits its utility as compared with magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasound."
"Does furosemide decrease morbidity or mortality for patients with diastolic or systolic dysfunction
Background-Treatment with diuretics has been reported to increase the risk of arrhythmic death in patients with hypertension. The effect of diuretic therapy on arrhythmic death in patients with left ventricular dysfunction is unknown. Methods and Results-We conducted a retrospective analysis of 6797 patients with an ejection fraction <0.36 enrolled in the Studies Of Left Ventricular Dysfunction (SOLVD) to assess the relation between diuretic use at baseline and the subsequent risk of arrhythmic death. Participants receiving a diuretic at baseline were more likely to have an arrhythmic death than those not receiving a diuretic (3.1 vs 1.7 arrhythmic deaths per 100 person-years, P=0.001). On univariate analysis, diuretic use was associated with an increased risk of arrhythmic death (relative risk [RR] 1.85, P=0.0001). After controlling for important covariates, diuretic use remained significantly associated with an increased risk of arrhythmic death (RR 1.37, P=0.009). Only non-potassium-sparing diuretic use was independently associated with arrhythmic death (RR 1.33, P=0.02). Use of a potassium-sparing diuretic, alone or in combination with a non-potassium-sparing diuretic, was not independently associated with an increased risk of arrhythmic death (RR 0.90, P=0.6). Conclusions-In SOLVD, baseline use of a non-potassium-sparing diuretic was associated with an increased risk of arrhythmic death, whereas baseline use of a potassium-sparing diuretic was not. These data suggest that diuretic-induced electrolyte disturbances may result in fatal arrhythmias in patients with systolic left ventricular dysfunction.","A retrospective study of SOLVD patients found a significant and independent association with increased risk of arrhythmic death among patients taking non-potassium-sparing diuretics (RR=1.33; 95% CI, 1.05-1.69)."
"What screening tests should you use to evaluate a man with low testosterone
Klinefelter syndrome is the most common sex chromosome disorder. Affected males carry an additional X chromosome, which results in male hypogonadism, androgen deficiency, and impaired spermatogenesis. Some patients may exhibit all of the classic signs of this disorder, including gynecomastia, small testes, sparse body hair, tallness, and infertility, whereas others, because of the wide variability in clinical expression, lack many of these features. Treatment consists of testosterone replacement therapy to correct the androgen deficiency and to provide patients with appropriate virilization. This therapy also has positive effects on mood and self-esteem and has been shown to protect against osteoporosis, although it will not reverse infertility. Although the diagnosis of Klinefelter syndrome is now made definitively using chromosomal karyotyping, revealing in most instances a 47,XXY genotype, the diagnosis also can be made using a careful history and results of a physical examination, with the hallmark being small, firm testes. As it affects 1 in 500 male patients and presents with a variety of clinical features, primary care physicians should be familiar with this condition.","A focused, cost-effective work-up will become ever more critical because an estimated 19% of men will be 65 years or older by 2050."
"Do beta-blockers worsen respiratory status for patients with COPD
Patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) have a resting restrictive ventilatory defect. Any type of exercise requires patients with CHF to markedly increase their minute ventilation. Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have airflow obstruction that leads to dynamic lung hyperinflation and reduced ventilatory response to exercise. Because exercise is associated with abnormally high minute ventilation in patients with CHF and with a limited minute ventilation increase in patients with COPD, functional capacity is severely impaired in patients with coexistent CHF and COPD. Optimal treatment of both conditions is a prerequisite to maximally improve functional capacity in patients with CHF and COPD. Unfortunately, beta-adrenergic blockade, the current cornerstone of CHF therapy, is frequently omitted in patients with CHF and COPD for fear of inducing bronchoconstriction. Furthermore, when prescribed, beta-adrenergic blockade is often attempted with a moderate dose of metoprolol tartrate, a beta-1-blocker that results in lesser clinical benefits than combined non-selective beta-blockade with carvedilol at the maximally recommended dose. Recent experience indicates that combined non-selective beta- and alpha-blockade with carvedilol is well tolerated in patients with COPD who do not have reversible airway obstruction. Alpha-adrenergic blockade may promote mild bronchodilation that offsets non-selective beta blockade-induced bronchoconstriction in patients with obstructive airway disease.","A 2004 narrative review article concluded that carvedilol was well-tolerated in patients with COPD without reversible airflow obstruction, but no evidence exists regarding its tolerability in patients with reversible airflow obstruction."
"What is the best treatment for plantar fasciitis
Three hundred two patients with chronic heel pain caused by proximal plantar fasciitis were enrolled in a study to assess the treatment effects consequent to administration of electrohydraulicall-generated extracorporeal shock waves. Symptoms had been present from 6 months to 18 years. Each treated patient satisfied numerous inclusion and exclusion criteria before he or she was accepted into this study, which was approved by the Food and Drug Administration as a randomized, double-blind evaluation of the efficacy of shock wave therapy for this disorder. Overall, at the predetermined evaluation period 3 months after one treatment, 56% more of the treated patients had a successful result by all four of the evaluation criteria when compared with the patients treated with a placebo. This difference was significant and corroborated the fact that this difference in the results was specifically attributable to the shock wave treatment, rather than any natural improvement caused by the natural history of the condition. The current study showed that the directed application of electrohydraulic-generated shock waves to the insertion of the plantar fascia onto the calcaneus is a safe and effective nonsurgical method for treating chronic, recalcitrant heel pain syndrome that has been present for at least 6 months and has been refractory to other commonly used nonoperative therapies. This technology, when delivered using the OssaTron (High Medical Technology, Kreuz-lingen, Switzerland), has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration specifically for the treatment of chronic proximal plantar fasciitis. The results suggest that this therapeutic modality should be considered before any surgical options, and even may be preferable to cortisone injection, which has a recognized risk of rupture of the plantar fascia and recurrence of symptoms.",A meta-analysis of 8 published studies involving 840 patients whose condition was not improved after conservative therapy for at least 6 months showed that up to 88% of patients experienced good to excellent outcomes with extracorporeal shock wave therapy and were satisfied with the result.
"What are the most effective nonpharmacologic therapies for irritable bowel syndrome
Traditional herbal therapies have been used for a long time to treat gastrointestinal disorders including irritable bowel syndrome, and their effectiveness from clinical research evidence needs to be systematically reviewed. To assess the effectiveness and safety of herbal medicines in patients with irritable bowel syndrome. We searched the following electronic databases till July 2004: The Cochrane Library (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, AMED, LILACS, the Chinese Biomedical Database, combined with hand searches of Chinese journals and conference proceedings till end of 2003. No language restriction was used. Randomised controlled trials of herbal medicines compared with no treatment, placebo, pharmacological interventions were included. Data were extracted independently by two authors. The methodological quality of trials was evaluated using the components of randomisation, allocation concealment, double blinding, and inclusion of randomised participants. Seventy-five randomised trials, involving 7957 participants with irritable bowel syndrome, met the inclusion criteria. The methodological quality of three double-blind, placebo-controlled trials was high, but the quality of remaining trials was generally low. Seventy-one different herbal medicines were tested in the included trials, in which herbal medicines were compared with placebo or conventional pharmacologic therapy. Herbal medicines were also combined with conventional therapy and compared to conventional therapy alone.Compared with placebo, a Standard Chinese herbal formula, individualised Chinese herbal medicine, STW 5 and STW 5-II, Tibetan herbal medicine Padma Lax, traditional Chinese formula Tongxie Yaofang, and Ayurvedic preparation showed significantly improvement of global symptoms. Compared with conventional therapy in 65 trials testing 51 different herbal medicines, 22 herbal medicines demonstrated a statistically significant benefit for symptom improvement, and 29 herbal medicines were not significantly different than conventional therapy. In nine trials that evaluated herbal medicine combined with conventional therapy, six tested herbal preparations showed additional benefit from the combination therapy compared with conventional monotherapy. No serious adverse events from the herbal medicines were reported. Some herbal medicines may improve the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome. However, positive findings from less rigorous trials should be interpreted with caution due to inadequate methodology, small sample sizes, and lack of confirming data. Some herbal medicines deserve further examination in high-quality trials.","A Cochrane review of herbal therapies evaluated 75 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), including 7957 patients; it concluded that some herbal preparations may reduce symptoms of IBS. However, more rigorous studies are needed: There was never more than 1 trial comparing a given herbal medicine with a specific control, making it difficult to combine trials in a meaningful way."
"What is the best treatment for Osgood-Schlatter disease
We present our experience with surgical treatment of unresolved, painful, late Osgood-Schlatter disease. In 70 operations performed in 67 patients (in three bilaterally) an ossicle under the distal patellar tendon was removed in 62 cases. In eight cases, excision of the prominent tibial tubercle and/or drilling of the epiphysis was performed. Additional procedures, such as rasping of the uneven anterior tibial surface, excision of inflammed bursa or the devitalized portion of the tendon, were done 21 times. Most patients were athletes or physically active young people. The mean age was 19.6 years. 54 operations were done on males and 16 on females. They had been followed preoperatively for 18 months and after surgery 2.2 years. The final results were excellent or good in 56, moderate in 9, poor in 3 and unknown in 2 cases. Osgood-Schlatter's disease may leave an ossicle under the distal patellar tendon, a prominent tibial tubercle or an uneven surface of anterior superior tibia. These may lead to pain and disability due to recurrent injuries or athletic exercises. Surgical treatment gives good results in chronic unresolved cases.","In 1 case series, 67 patients (70 knees) (mean age 19.6, 77% male) with at least 18 months of symptoms despite conservative treatment underwent resection of an ossicle (62 cases) or excision of prominent tibial tubercle (8 cases). These patients were followed for 2.2 years, with 56 (90%) patients with ossicle-resection able to return to maximal sports activity without pain, tenderness, loss of motion, or atrophy."
"Does psychiatric treatment help patients with intractable chronic pain
A computer and a hand search of the literature recovered 33 papers from which 25 trials suitable for meta-analysis were identified. We compared the effectiveness of cognitive-behavioural treatments with the waiting list control and alternative treatment control conditions. There was a great diversity of measurements which we grouped into domains representing major facets of pain. Effect sizes, corrected for measurement unreliability, were estimated for each domain. When compared with the waiting list control conditions cognitive-behavioural treatments were associated with significant effect sizes on all domains of measurement (median effect size across domains = 0.5). Comparison with alternative active treatments revealed that cognitive-behavioural treatments produced significantly greater changes for the domains of pain experience, cognitive coping and appraisal (positive coping measures), and reduced behavioural expression of pain. Differences on the following domains were not significant; mood/affect (depression and other, non-depression, measures), cognitive coping and appraisal (negative, e.g. catastrophization), and social role functioning. We conclude that active psychological treatments based on the principle of cognitive behavioural therapy are effective. We discuss the results with reference to the complexity and quality of the trials.","A systematic review of 25 studies (1672 patients) found significant effect sizes for cognitive therapies in reducing pain and other symptoms in chronic musculoskeletal pain, including rheumatoid arthritis, fibromyalgia, back, and other pain syndromes. However, many of the trials were small or taken from ""samples of convenience"" from rehabilitation and pain clinics, and most lacked documentation of randomization."
"Is there a well-tested tool to detect drug-seeking behaviors in chronic pain patients
The original Screener and Opioid Assessment for Patients with Pain (SOAPP) is a conceptually derived self-report questionnaire designed to predict aberrant medication-related behaviors among chronic pain patients considered for long-term opioid therapy. The purpose of this study was to develop and validate an empirically derived version of the SOAPP (SOAPP-R) that addresses some limitations of the original SOAPP. In successive steps, items were reduced from an initial pool of 142 to a 97-item beta version. The beta version was administered to 283 chronic pain patients receiving long-term opioid therapy. Items were evaluated based on data collected at follow-up, including correlation with the Aberrant Drug Behavior Index (ADBI), derived from interview data, physician ratings, and urine toxicology screens. Twenty-four items were retained and comprise the final SOAPP-R. Coefficient alpha was .88, and receiver operating characteristics curve analysis yielded an area under the curve of .81 (P < .001). A cutoff score of 18 showed adequate sensitivity (.81) and specificity (.68). The obtained psychometrics, along with the use of a predictive criterion that goes beyond self-report, suggest that the SOAPP-R is an improvement over the original version in screening risk potential for aberrant medication-related behavior among persons with chronic pain. PERSPECTIVE: There is a need for a screener for abuse risk in patients prescribed opioids for pain. This study presents a revised version of the SOAPP-R that is empirically derived with good reliability and validity but is less susceptible to overt deception than the original SOAPP version 1.","The Screener and Opioid Assessment for Patients with Pain (SOAPP-R) is a 24-item, self-administered questionnaire that stratifies patients being considered for opioid therapy into lower or higher risk for future opioid-related aberrant behaviors. Each item queries frequency of behaviors and emotions consistent with opioid misuse and can be scored as 0 (never) to 4 (very often). The items on the SOAPP-R were developed by a consensus panel of pain and addiction experts. In a multidisciplinary pain center study, the SOAPP-R was administered to 283 chronic pain patients who were followed for 5 months. At a cutoff score of ≥18, the test had a positive likelihood ratio (LR+) of 3.80 and a negative likelihood ratio (LR-) of 0.29 for detecting opioid misuse. At this cutoff, the SOAPP-R was 81% sensitive and 68% specific for predicting patients at high risk for aberrant behavior."
"What vitamins and minerals should be given to breastfed and bottle-fed infants
Vitamin K deficiency can cause bleeding in an infant in the first weeks of life. This is known as Hemorrhagic Disease of the Newborn (HDN). HDN is divided into three categories: early, classic and late HDN. Early HDN occurs within 24 hours post partum and falls outside the scope of this review. Classic HDN occurs on days one to seven; common bleeding sites are gastrointestinal, cutaneous, nasal and from a circumcision. Late HDN occurs from week 2-12; the most common bleeding sites are intracranial, cutaneous, and gastrointestinal. Vitamin K is commonly given prophylactically after birth for the prevention of HDN, but the preferred route is uncertain. To review the evidence from randomized trials in order to determine the effectiveness of vitamin K prophylaxis in the prevention of classic and late HDN. Main questions are: Is one dose of vitamin K, given after birth, able to significantly reduce the incidence of classic and late HDN? Is there a significant difference between the oral route and the intramuscular route in preventing classic and late HDN? Are multiple oral doses of vitamin K, given after birth, able to significantly reduce the incidence of classic and late HDN? The standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group was used. All trials using random or quasi-random patient allocation, in which methods of vitamin K prophylaxis in infants were compared to each other, placebo or no treatment, were included. Data were extracted independently by each author and were analysed with the standard methods of the Cochrane Collaboration and its Neonatal Review Group, using relative risk, risk difference and weighted mean difference. Two eligible randomized trials, each comparing a single dose of intramuscular vitamin K with placebo or nothing, assessed effect on clinical bleeding. One dose of vitamin K reduced clinical bleeding at 1-7 days, including bleeding after circumcision, and improved biochemical indices of coagulation status. Eleven additional eligible randomized trials compared either a single oral dose of vitamin K with placebo or nothing, a single oral with a single intramuscular dose of vitamin K, or three oral doses with a single intramuscular dose. None of these trials assessed clinical bleeding. Oral vitamin K improved biochemical indices of coagulation status at 1-7 days. There was no evidence of a difference between the oral and intramuscular route in effects on biochemical indices of coagulation status. A single oral compared with a single intramuscular dose resulted in lower plasma vitamin K levels at two weeks and one month, whereas a 3-dose oral schedule resulted in higher plasma vitamin K levels at two weeks and at two months than did a single intramuscular dose. A single dose (1.0 mg) of intramuscular vitamin K after birth is effective in the prevention of classic HDN. Either intramuscular or oral (1.0 mg) vitamin K prophylaxis improves biochemical indices of coagulation status at 1-7 days. Neither intramuscular nor oral vitamin K has been tested in randomized trials with respect to effect on late HDN. Oral vitamin K, either single or multiple dose, has not been tested in randomized trials for its effect on either classic or late HDN.","The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews looked at randomized trials to determine the effectiveness of vitamin K prophylaxis in preventing classic hemorrhagic disease of the newborn. Two trials demonstrated that a single dose of intramuscular vitamin K reduced clinical bleeding at 1 to 7 days. Oral vitamin K has been studied for its effects on biochemical indices of coagulation status, but not for its clinical effects on bleeding. A single oral vitamin K dose at birth resulted in lower vitamin K levels at 2 weeks and 1 month, compared with a single dose of intramuscular vitamin K at birth."
"What's the best treatment for sebaceous cysts
The removal of keratinous and pilar cysts by the punch incision technique is an alternative to traditional excision methods. It is easy to perform with commonly available instruments, and quick. Faster healing and less scarring are advantages because of the small opening through which the cysts are removed. No previous studies have documented recurrence rates of cysts removed by this technique or the recurrence rates following either traditional excision surgery or other alternative minimal excision techniques. We provide data demonstrating that the removal of keratinous and pilar cysts by the punch incision technique is a viable option with an acceptably low recurrence rate. To evaluate the overall recurrence rates of keratinous and pilar cysts removed by the punch incision technique and rates of recurrence by location and using other cyst characteristics. A preliminary retrospective chart review of cysts removed exclusively by the punch incision technique from 1989 to 1998 was performed. The rate of cyst recurrence and average time to patient-initiated follow-up visit for evaluation and removal were determined. In a second study, a survey requested information on the presence of cyst recurrence. This was mailed to all 646 patients who had cysts removed by the punch incision technique from 1989 to 1998 to evaluate possible cyst recurrence in patients who did not choose to follow-up at the office. Statistical analysis was performed to determine the overall recurrence rates and recurrence rates based on location and other cyst characteristics. Preliminary chart review revealed a recurrence rate of 3.6%, with a mean time to patient-initiated follow-up of 79.3 weeks. In the second study, an analysis of cyst recurrence rates in patients returning the survey revealed an 8.3% recurrence rate. Subanalysis revealed a trend showing that inflamed cysts had a lower recurrence rate. Another trend noted was that cysts removed from the back and ear had the highest recurrence rates (13.8 and 13.0%, respectively) compared to those removed from other locations. Most cysts (54.5%) recurred within the first year after punch incision removal. This is the first study to document recurrence rates using the punch incision technique for removal of epithelial cysts. Though most recurrences occur within the first year, there is a delay in patients reporting to their doctors for reexcision, perhaps because recurrent cysts are often asymptomatic. Studies to determine the recurrence rates for cyst excision using other techniques should be performed. The punch incision technique, when properly performed, is a satisfactory removal method with a recurrence rate of less then 10%.","Punch biopsy excision is similar to the minimal excision technique except that the incision is made using a single-use disposable dermal punch following injection of lidocaine. Expulsion of the cyst contents, with cyst wall, via lateral pressure is performed and occasionally followed by closure with one suture."
"Can type 2 diabetes be prevented through diet and exercise
Type 2 diabetes mellitus is increasingly common, primarily because of increases in the prevalence of a sedentary lifestyle and obesity. Whether type 2 diabetes can be prevented by interventions that affect the lifestyles of subjects at high risk for the disease is not known. We randomly assigned 522 middle-aged, overweight subjects (172 men and 350 women; mean age, 55 years; mean body-mass index [weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters], 31) with impaired glucose tolerance to either the intervention group or the control group. Each subject in the intervention group received individualized counseling aimed at reducing weight, total intake of fat, and intake of saturated fat and increasing intake of fiber and physical activity. An oral glucose-tolerance test was performed annually; the diagnosis of diabetes was confirmed by a second test. The mean duration of follow-up was 3.2 years. The mean (+/-SD) amount of weight lost between base line and the end of year 1 was 4.2+/-5.1 kg in the intervention group and 0.8+/-3.7 kg in the control group; the net loss by the end of year 2 was 3.5+/-5.5 kg in the intervention group and 0.8+/-4.4 kg in the control group (P<0.001 for both comparisons between the groups). The cumulative incidence of diabetes after four years was 11 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 6 to 15 percent) in the intervention group and 23 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 17 to 29 percent) in the control group. During the trial, the risk of diabetes was reduced by 58 percent (P<0.001) in the intervention group. The reduction in the incidence of diabetes was directly associated with changes in lifestyle. Type 2 diabetes can be prevented by changes in the lifestyles of high-risk subjects.","The Finnish Diabetes Prevention Study similarly randomized 522 patients, aged 40 to 65 years, with impaired glucose tolerance and obesity (mean BMI=31) to either intensive lifestyle intervention or control and followed them for 3.2 years. The lifestyle intervention included moderate exercise for at least 150 minutes per week and weight loss of at least 5%. Patients were offered an individualized exercise plan with supervised aerobic exercise plus circuit-type resistance sessions 3 times a week. Nutritionists met with patients 7 times in the first year and every 3 months after that. Patients were counseled to increase fiber intake, reduce total fat below 30% of total calories, and reduce saturated fat below 10%. The control group was given general information on diet and exercise without individualized programs. Most patients (86%) in the intervention group met their exercise goal, and 25% met the fiber requirement. Compared with the control group, the intervention group had greater success rate for each category. Intensive lifestyle intervention reduced the incidence of diabetes by 58% (number needed to treat=5 for 5 years."
"What environmental modifications improve pediatric asthma
In Atlanta, as in other major urban areas of the United States, asthma is a leading cause of school absenteeism, emergency department use, and hospitalization. Recent guidelines for asthma management recommend reducing exposure to relevant allergens, but neither the feasibility nor the efficacy of this form of treatment has been established for children living in poverty. We sought to investigate allergen avoidance as a treatment for asthma among inner-city children. One hundred four children with asthma living in the city of Atlanta were enrolled into a controlled trial of avoidance without being skin tested. The children were randomized to an active avoidance group, a placebo avoidance group, and a second control group for which no house visits occurred until the end of the first year. Avoidance included bed and pillow covers, hot washing of bedding, and cockroach bait. Eighty-five children completed the study, and the outcome was measured as unscheduled clinic visits, emergency department visits, and hospitalization for asthma, as well as changes in mite and cockroach allergen levels. There was a significant decrease in acute visits for asthma among children whose homes were visited (P < .001). However, there was no significant difference between the active and placebo homes either in the effect on asthma visits or in allergen concentrations. When the children with mite allergy were considered separately, there was a significant correlation between decreased mite allergen and change in acute visits (P < .01). The avoidance measures for cockroach allergen appeared to be ineffective, and the changes observed did not correlate with changes in visits. Applying allergen avoidance as a treatment for asthma among children living in poverty is difficult because of multiple sensitivities and problems applying the protocols in this environment. The current results demonstrate that home visiting positively influences the management of asthma among families living in poverty. Furthermore, the results for children with mite allergy strongly suggest that decreasing relevant allergen exposure should be an objective of treatment in this population.","A group of researchers found that home visits by care providers may decrease acute medical visits, specific allergy avoidance steps did not make a difference."
"What's the best strategy for bipolar disorder during pregnancy
Additional pharmacological treatments are needed for patients with bipolar disorder. We describe our experience with verapamil in an inclusive, sequential series of outpatient women (some pregnant) with bipolar disorder. All women who were prescribed verapamil for bipolar disorder (n = 37) were included. We used the criterion of 50% reduction in scores on the Mania Rating Scale or the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression to define response for women who were treated for an acute episode of bipolar hypomania/mania or depression, respectively. For euthymic women who chose verapamil maintenance treatment, we evaluated whether they met criteria for a recurrent episode during therapy. Treatment for acute episodes was initiated in 28 women. Of women with depression and mania, 39% and 100% responded, respectively. Seven of the nine patients (77%) with mixed states responded: all seven improved to response criterion on the mania scale, and two responded on the depression scales as well. Six of eight patients who received continuation therapy remained well. These data provide evidence that verapamil is effective for mania. The response rate for mania compares favorably to that for other mood stabilizers. After decades of case reports and underpowered clinical trials, we must definitively study verapamil for efficacy and gender specificity in bipolar disorder.",Wisner et al found verapamil to be effective for mania in a nonrandomized prospective study of bipolar hypomanic/manic and depressed patients.
"Should liver enzymes be checked in a patient taking niacin
To compare escalating doses of immediate-release (IR) and sustained-release (SR) niacin for effectiveness in reducing levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides and increasing levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and for the occurrence of adverse reactions, especially hepatotoxicity. Randomized, double-blind, parallel comparison of IR and SR niacin administered sequentially at 500, 1000, 1500, 2000, and 3000 mg/d, each for 6 weeks. Cholesterol research center. Forty-six adults, 23 in each group, with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels greater than 4.14 mmol/L (160 mg/dL) after 1 month of a step 1 National Cholesterol Education Program diet. Fourteen-hour fasting lipid and lipoprotein cholesterol levels, results of clinical laboratory tests, a symptom questionnaire, and withdrawal rates. The SR niacin lowered low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels significantly more than IR niacin did at the dosage of 1500 mg/d and above, while IR niacin increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels significantly more than SR niacin did at all dosage levels. The reduction in triglyceride levels was similar with IR and SR niacin. Nine (39%) of the 23 patients assigned to the IR dosage form withdrew before completing the 3000-mg daily dose; the most common reasons for withdrawal were vasodilatory symptoms, fatigue, and acanthosis nigricans. Eighteen (78%) of the 23 patients assigned to the SR dosage form withdrew before completing the 3000-mg daily dose; the most common reasons for withdrawal were gastrointestinal tract symptoms, fatigue, and increases in levels of liver aminotransferases, often with symptoms of hepatic dysfunction. None of the patients taking IR niacin developed hepatotoxic effects, while 12 (52%) of the 23 patients taking SR niacin did. The SR form of niacin is hepatotoxic and should be restricted from use. The IR niacin is preferred for the management of hypercholesterolemia but can also cause significant adverse effects and should be given only to patients who can be carefully monitored by experienced health professionals.","american society of health-system pharmacists recommend more frequent monitoring for high-risk patients-risks include doses >2 g/d for LA/SR and >3 g/d for IR; LA/SR formulations; switching between formulations; taking concomitant drugs that interact ie, sulfonylureas; excessive alcohol use undefined; and preexisting liver disease based on a bivariate analysis of factors associated with increased risk of hepatic toxicity from a single retrospective cohort study."
"Are tympanostomy tubes indicated for recurrent acute otitis media
To determine the efficacy of amoxicillin prophylaxis and of tympanostomy tube insertion in preventing recurrences of acute otitis media, we randomized 264 children 7 to 35 months of age who had a history of recurrent otitis media but were free of middle ear effusion to receive either amoxicillin prophylaxis, bilateral tympanostomy tube insertion or placebo. The average rate of new episodes per child year of either acute otitis media or otorrhea was 0.60 in the amoxicillin group, 1.08 in the placebo group and 1.02 in the tympanostomy tube group (amoxicillin vs. placebo, P less than 0.001; tubes vs. placebo, P = 0.25). The average proportion of time with otitis media of any type was 10.0% in the amoxicillin group, 15.0% in the placebo group and 6.6% in the tympanostomy tube group (amoxicillin vs. placebo, P = 0.03; tubes vs. placebo, P less than 0.001). At the 2-year end point, the rate of attrition was 42.2% in the amoxicillin group, 45.5% in the placebo group and 26.7% in the tympanostomy tube group. Adverse drug reactions occurred in 7.0% of the amoxicillin group and persistent tympanic membrane perforations developed in 3.9% of the tympanostomy tube group. The observed degree of efficacy of amoxicillin prophylaxis and of tympanostomy tube insertion must be viewed in light of the fact that study subjects proved not to have been at as high risk for acute otitis media as had been anticipated and in view of the differential attrition rates.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","One randomized controlled trial of 264 children, aged 7 to 35 months, with a history of recurrent acute otitis media but free of middle-ear effusion, compared tubes with medical therapy and found no difference in recurrence over 2 years. The medical therapy arm received prophylaxis with either amoxicillin or placebo. The amoxicillin arm had 0.6 fewer episodes of acute otitis media per year compared with the other 2, a statistically significant 40% decrease (relative risk reduction=0.4). The average time with otitis media of any type (acute otitis media, otitis media with effusion, or ottorhea) also decreased-15.0% in the placebo group, 10.0% in the amoxicillin group, and 6.6% in the tympanostomy tube group (amoxicillin vs. placebo, P=.03; tubes vs. placebo, P<.001). Higher dropout rates occurred in the amoxicillin and medical treatment groups."
"When should we treat isolated high triglycerides
Coronary heart disease patients with low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels, high triglyceride levels, or both are at an increased risk of cardiovascular events, but the clinical impact of raising HDL-C or decreasing triglycerides remains to be confirmed. In a double-blind trial, 3090 patients with a previous myocardial infarction or stable angina, total cholesterol of 180 to 250 mg/dL, HDL-C < or =45 mg/dL, triglycerides < or =300 mg/dL, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol < or =180 mg/dL were randomized to receive either 400 mg of bezafibrate per day or a placebo; they were followed for a mean of 6.2 years. The primary end point was fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction or sudden death. Bezafibrate increased HDL-C by 18% and reduced triglycerides by 21%. The frequency of the primary end point was 13. 6% on bezafibrate versus 15.0% on placebo (P=0.26). After 6.2 years, the reduction in the cumulative probability of the primary end point was 7.3%, (P=0.24). In a post hoc analysis in the subgroup with high baseline triglycerides (> or =200 mg/dL), the reduction in the cumulative probability of the primary end point by bezafibrate was 39.5% (P=0.02). Total and noncardiac mortality rates were similar, and adverse events and cancer were equally distributed. Bezafibrate was safe and effective in elevating HDL-C levels and lowering triglycerides. An overall trend in a reduction of the incidence of primary end points was observed. The reduction in the primary end point in patients with high baseline triglycerides (> or =200 mg/dL) requires further confirmation.","In 3 large-scale prospective, placebo-controlled trials (the Helsinki Heart Study, a primary prevention study, and the VA-HIT and Bezafibrate Infarction Prevention trials, both secondary prevention studies), lowering triglycerides and raising high density lipoprotein concurrently improved outcomes. Successful dietary and medical interventions, especially with statins and fibrates, improved overall lipid profiles-not just triglyceride levels."
"Which lab tests are best when you suspect hypothyroidism
The objective of this study was to evaluate parameters of thyroid function and indices of peripheral thyroid hormone action (such as SHBG) in patients whose hypothyroidism was considered well controlled under current criteria. Eighty-five patients with T4-treated hypothyroidism, 28 of whom had athyria, were compared with 114 normal individuals with the same TSH levels. T3 levels were significantly lower in hypothyroidism although mean T4 and fT4 levels were significantly higher. Furthermore, mean SHBG levels were significantly lower in hypothyroidism independently of age. The difference remained when stricter criteria for adequate treatment were applied (TSH < 2.5 microgU/ml). Significant negative correlations were found between logTSH and T3. The slopes of the regression lines of T3 to TSH were significantly different in the control group and the hypothyroid group: thus, for the same TSH levels, T3 levels were lower in the hypothyroid group. We conclude that patients with T4-treated hypothyroidism have lower T3 levels, lower T3/T4 ratio and lower SHBG than normal individuals with the same TSH, perhaps indicating relative tissue hypothyroidism in the liver. TSH levels used to monitor substitution, mostly regulated by intracellular T3 in the pituitary, may not be such a good indicator of adequate thyroid hormone action in all tissues. The co-administration of T3 may prove more effective in this respect, provided novel suitable preparations are developed. Until this is accomplished, substitution in hypothyroidism should aim at low normal TSH, to ensure normal T3 levels.",A 2005 study suggested lowering the target thyroid-stimulating hormone level for assessing adequate replacement in patients treated with standard levothyroxine because subtherapeutic T3 levels were found despite normal thyroid-stimulating hormone levels in these patients.
"Do preparticipation clinical exams reduce morbidity and mortality for athletes
To determine if a physician-administered physical examination and screening questionnaire accurately detects exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) in adolescent athletes. Study design: Cross-sectional study of 256 adolescents participating in organized sports from 3 suburban high schools. The number of persons screened positive for EIB by physical examination and questionnaire was compared with the number of persons with EIB diagnosed by a ""gold standard"" test that consisted of a 7-minute exercise challenge followed by serial spirometry. We diagnosed EIB in 9.4% of adolescent athletes. The screening history identified persons with symptoms or a previous diagnosis suggestive of EIB in 39.5% of the participants, but only 12.9% of these persons actually had EIB. Among adolescents with a negative review of symptoms of asthma or EIB, 7.8% had EIB. Among adolescents with no previous diagnosis of asthma, allergic rhinitis, or EIB, 7.2% had EIB diagnosed by exercise challenge. Persons who screened negative on all questions about symptoms or history of asthma, EIB, and allergic rhinitis accounted for 45.8% of the adolescents with EIB. EIB occurs frequently in adolescent athletes, and screening by physical examination and medical history does not accurately detect it.","A prospective cross-sectional study studied 352 adolescents from 3 suburban Washington state schools. The students completed a 14-item exercise-induced bronchospasm (EIB) questionnaire, had a physical exam, and underwent a 7-minute exercise challenge spirometry. Complete data were available for 256 of the students. EIB was diagnosed by spirometry in 9.4% of the athletes. No student had EIB detected solely by physical exam. Using a cutoff of 2 positive questions, the questionnaire had a sensitivity of 71% and a specificity of 47%, with a negative and positive predictive value of 6% and 12%, respectively. This study concluded that EIB occurs frequently in adolescent athletes, but screening by physical exam and medical history does not accurately detect it."
"What medications are safe and effective for heartburn during pregnancy
In a retrospective study to compare the drug consumption during pregnancy of mothers of infants with congenital abnormalities and of those without, over 97% of 1,369 mothers took prescribed drugs and 65% self-administered drugs. Significantly more mothers of infants with congenital abnormalities took aspirin, antacids, dextroamphetamine, phenobarbitone, sodium amytal, other barbiturates, cough medicines, iron, sulphonamides, and nicotinamide than mothers in the control group. However, most mothers taking analgesics, antacids, appetite suppressants, barbiturates, cough medicines, iron, sulphonamides, and vitamins produced normal infants. Any teratogenic effect of these drugs is therefore one of low potency. On the other hand, deficiencies such as those of ascorbic acid and folic acid may have a teratogenic effect. There is need for caution in presuming teratogenic effects on the basis of the associations shown here. During pregnancy, however, it would appear wise to avoid the administration of any drug which carries a suspicion of teratogenicity unless that drug is specifically indicated, and self-medication with common household remedies such as aspirin and antacids should be avoided. These recommendations would also apply to any woman of childbearing age in whom conception is likely.","A single case-control study found a higher rate of congenital anomalies in children of women who took antacids in the first trimester (unadjusted odds ratio calculated from data=2.36; P <.05). This association was not detected when studied over the entire pregnancy. The rate of malformations was not different for magnesium, aluminum, and bicarbonate. The association could well be due to recall bias or other systematic biases inherent in case-control methodology."
"Should patients receive 23-valent pneumococcal vaccination more than once
Diseases caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae) continue to cause substantial morbidity and mortality throughout the world. Polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccines have been developed for over 50 years and may have the potential to prevent disease and death. To assess the effectiveness of polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccination in preventing disease or death in adults. Trials were identified by electronic searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) issue 2, 2003 (which includes the Cochrane ARI Group's specialised register); MEDLINE (January 1966 to June 2003); and EMBASE (1974 to June 2003). We searched existing literature. The bibliographies of all newly revealed studies were read in order to identify further studies. The vaccine manufacturers, the lead authors of newly identified studies not included in existing meta-analyses were contacted. A) Prospective, randomised or quasi-randomised studies comparing pneumococcal vaccines with placebo, control vaccines or no intervention.B) Case-control studies (including indirect cohort studies) assessing pneumococcal vaccine effectiveness against invasive pneumococcal disease. Cohort studies are excluded. A) Randomised studies. Trial quality assessment was conducted by two reviewers (JH and DT). Data extraction was done by three reviewers (JH, DT, KD). There were many instances of unclear or incomplete data in the trial reports, and the final dataset was arrived at after much deliberation and discussion, including comparison with the data used in two previous reviews of this question. Due to the age of the trials (dating back to 1954 in one case) it was not generally possible to obtain clarification from the authors, though a partial clarification was achieved in one case.B) Non-randomised studies. Study quality was assessed by two reviewers (RA and KD). The combined results from the randomised studies fail to show that the polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccine is effective in preventing either pneumonia (outcome 6: odds ratio = 0.77, confidence interval 0.58, 1.02, number = 14) or death (outcome 8: odds ratio 0.90, confidence interval 0.76, 1.07, number = 11). Despite encouraging data from some very early trials, pooling trials published from 1977 on suggests there is no effect (outcome 6; odds ratio = 0.96, confidence interval 0.80, 1.15, number = 12; outcome 9: odds ratio = 0.98, confidence interval 0.88, 1.09, number = 10). The available data cannot distinguish whether this heterogeneity in results is due to improvements in trial methodology and reporting, to differences in trial setting or to real loss of efficacy over time. This is because the early, poorly reported trials were conducted in high-risk healthy populations where the expected benefit is greatest. The case-control studies show significant efficacy in preventing invasive pneumococcal disease: OR 0.47 (CI 0.37, 0.59) corresponding to an efficacy of 53%. While polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccines do not appear to reduce the incidence of pneumonia or death in adults with or without chronic illness, or in the elderly (55 years and above), the evidence from non-randomised studies suggests that the vaccines are effective in the reducing the incidence of the more specific outcome, invasive pneumococcal disease, among adults and the immunocompetent elderly (55 years and above). Surveillance data suggest that infection rates vary widely between and also within countries, but a typical figure in developed countries is 0.01%, or 10 per 100,000 per year. Efficacy of 50% then corresponds to a number-needed-to-treat (NNT) of 20,000 vaccinations per infection avoided, and perhaps 50,000 per death avoided.","Most recently, a Cochrane Review (updated in 2005) concluded that ""the combined results from randomized studies fail to show that the polysaccharide vaccine is effective in preventing either pneumonia or death"". However, they did recognize that the nonrandomized studies have consistently shown that the polysaccharide vaccine is effective in reducing the more specific outcome of invasive pneumococcal disease bacteremia and meningitis."
"Should we treat elevated cholesterol in elderly patients
To determine the effect of lovastatin therapy on health-related quality of life in older persons. A prospective, randomized, double blind clinical trial. Four university medical center research clinics. There were 431 men and women, primarily 65 years of age or older, with low density lipoprotein levels greater than 159 mg/dL and less than 221 mg/dL. Exclusion criteria included a Mini-Mental state score less than 24 or presence of recent cardiovascular events or other serious chronic disease likely to shorten survival. All participants were administered the National Cholesterol Education Program step one diet and were then randomized to placebo, 20 mg lovastatin, or 40 mg lovastatin. Areas of health-related quality of life assessed in the Cholesterol Reduction in Seniors Program (CRISP) included: (1) physical functioning, (2) sleep behavior, (3) social support, (4) depression, (5) cognitive function, and (6) health perception. Three global change questions asked the patients to judge change in general health since starting the study diet or the study medication and change in ability to function or care for self. Although some patients were followed for a total of 12 months, all participants were followed for 6 months, and 6-month data have been used for the primary analysis in this paper. Patients treated with 20 mg of lovastatin had a 17% and 24% reduction in total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol, respectively. Patients treated with the 40-mg lovastatin dose achieved reductions of 20% for total cholesterol and 28% for LDL-cholesterol. Complaints of possible adverse events were remarkably similar in the two active treatment groups and the placebo group. At 6 months of follow-up there were no statistically significant differences found in mean change scores from baseline between treatment groups on the health-related quality of life measures (physical functioning, sleep, social support, depression, cognitive function scales, health perception) or global questions. This study demonstrates that lovastatin was extremely well tolerated in an older cohort, both with regard to symptoms and to health-related quality of life.","Statins do not decrease health-related quality of life. Approximately 1% to 4% of those who take statins experience side effects, including abnormal liver function, arthralgias, myalgias, rash, sinusitis, and diarrhea."
"Which lifestyle interventions effectively lower low density lipoprotein cholesterol
Decreased low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in chronic alcoholics is well known. However, the importance of light to moderate alcohol consumption is less certain. We investigated the association of alcohol intake with risk for increased LDL cholesterol over 5 years in a cohort of 933 Japanese male office workers aged 35 to 54 years who had LDL cholesterol levels less than 140 mg/dl and were not taking medication for dyslipidemia, hypertension, diabetes, liver disease, or hyperuricemia at study entry. Incident-increased LDL cholesterol was defined by an LDL cholesterol level of 140 mg/dl or more or use of medication for dyslipidemia. Each individual's slope for LDL cholesterol was also calculated with a simple linear regression model. Three hundred twenty-one men developed increased LDL cholesterol during 3785 person-years of follow-up. After controlling for potential predictors of increased LDL cholesterol, the relative risk for increased LDL cholesterol compared with nondrinkers was 0.89 for those who drank 0.1 to 22.9 g/day of ethanol, 0.74 for those who drank 23.0 to 45.9 g/day of ethanol, 0.64 for those who drank 46.0 to 59.9 g/day of ethanol, and 0.54 for those who drank 69.0 g/day or more of ethanol (p < 0.001). Slopes of LDL cholesterol level decreased significantly as alcohol intake increased. From multiple linear regression analyses, alcohol intake remained as an independent negative factor for slopes of LDL cholesterol level. Alcohol intake is negatively associated with development of increased LDL cholesterol in middle-aged Japanese men.",One 5-year-long cohort study (N=933) showed that alcohol was associated with LDL-C reduction in a dose-dependent manner. Two crossover trials (4-6 weeks in duration) conducted among heavy drinkers showed that LDL-C increased when alcohol intake decreased. Two randomized crossover trials (8-12 weeks in duration) found a statistically significant decrease in LDL-C with consumption of 1 to 2 drinks daily.
"What is the best treatment for mild to moderate acne
Acne occurs in most persons sometime during adolescence or early adulthood and is a frequent reason for visits to dermatologists and for prescription drug therapy. The purpose of this study was to analyze changes in the utilization of physician services and medications for the treatment of acne. An analysis was performed of data from two US federal surveys of outpatient physician services and prescribing for the years 1980 to 1997 and two commercial sources of drug prescription data for 1996 to 1998. From these data, I estimated visits for acne and drugs prescribed during these visits. Visits for women principally for acne are about 80% more frequent than those for men. Each year 5 million prescriptions for oral antibiotics and 1.4 million prescriptions for isotretinoin are dispensed for the treatment of acne. Substantial health care resources are devoted to the treatment of acne, with women particularly likely to continue to frequently utilize these services after 19 years of age.","Acne vulgaris is the most common cutaneous disorder, affecting about 45 million people in the United States. Five to 6 million acne-related visits are made to physicians in outpatient offices each year."
"What is the best way to treat tinea cruris
In separate multicentre, randomized, double-blind clinical trials, 1% ciclopirox olamine cream was compared with its cream vehicle and with 1% clotrimazole cream as treatment for tinea corporis and tinea cruris. Patients who demonstrated clinical and mycological findings consistent with the diagnoses of tinea corporis or tinea cruris were included in the study. Clinical and mycological evaluations were made pretreatment, at the end of each of the four weeks of treatment, and weekly for the two weeks immediately following cessation of treatment. In both studies, use of ciclopirox olamine cream resulted in demonstrable improvements after the first week of therapy and in complete clinical and mycological clearing in two thirds of the patients at the end of the treatment period. These results were maintained through the two-week drug-free observation period that followed the end of treatment. Statistically, the results with ciclopirox olamine cream were significantly better than those with the vehicle and were equivalent to those with clotrimazole cream. All treatments were well tolerated.","One randomized controlled trials compared cure rates for 139 patients for clotrimazole 1% cream compared with ciclopirox olamine 1% cream when both were applied twice daily for 28 days. By the end of the 4-week period, 69% of the clotrimazole group was clinically and mycologically cured compared with 64% of the ciclopirox group."
"What interventions can help patients stop using chewing tobacco
Use of smokeless tobacco (ST) can lead to nicotine addiction and health problems including periodontal disease and oral cancer To assess the effects of behavioural and pharmacotherapeutic interventions to treat ST use. We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group trials register (February 2004), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2004), MEDLINE (January 1966-February 2004), EMBASE (1988-January 2004), CINAHL (1982-February 2004), PsycINFO (1984-February 2004), Database of Abstract of Reviews of Effectiveness (DARE, The Cochrane Library, Issue 1, 2004). Randomized trials of behavioural or pharmacological interventions to help users of ST to quit, with follow-up of at least six months. Two authors independently extracted data. One trial of bupropion did not detect a benefit of treatment after six months (Odds Ratio (OR) 1.00, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.23 to 4.37). Three trials of nicotine patch did not detect a benefit (OR 1.16, 95% CI: 0.88 to 1.54), nor did two trials of nicotine gum (OR 0.98, 95% CI: 0.59 to 1.63). There was statistical heterogeneity among the results of eight trials of behavioural interventions included in the meta-analysis. Three trials showed significant benefits of intervention. In a post-hoc analysis the trials of interventions which included an oral examination and feedback about ST-induced mucosal changes had homogeneous results and when pooled showed a significant benefit (OR 2.41 95% CI: 1.79 to 3.24). Behavioural interventions should be used to help ST users to quit. Pharmacotherapies have not been shown to affect long-term abstinence but larger trials are needed.",A meta-analysis concluded that behavioral interventions appear to be effective for increasing tobacco abstinence rates.
"When and how should you evaluate a child for obstructive sleep apnea
To identify the clinical factor(s) that identify obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS) in children. A prospective study of children referred to the sleep clinic of the paediatric department was conducted in a public non-teaching regional hospital in Hong Kong. A standard questionnaire was administered and overnight sleep polysomnography was performed in a consecutive series of patients. Logistic regression analysis was performed to obtain significant risk factors for prediction of OSAS in this series of patients. Sixty-two children were enrolled into the study and 22 were diagnosed to have OSAS. Logistic regression analysis showed that, among all the answers, 'snoring every night' is the single most significant risk factor (p<0.0001) to predict OSAS. 'Snoring every night' has a sensitivity of 91% and specificity of 75% for OSAS patients. It also has a positive predictive value of 67% and negative predictive value of 94%. Snoring every night is an important risk factor in identifying OSAS in children. Priority for an overnight sleep polysomnogram should be given to those with this symptom.","A prospective case-series of 62 consecutive children referred to a sleep clinic for suspected obstructive sleep apnea correlated nightly snoring (relative risk [RR]=10.67; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.72-41.8) and observed apnea (RR=3.43; 95% CI, 1.42-6.76) with obstructive sleep apnea diagnosed by polysomnography."
"What is the best hypnotic for use in the elderly
Insomnia affects 30-35% of people living in developed countries. The impact of insomnia on daytime functioning and its relationship with medical and psychiatric illnesses necessitate early treatment to prevent insomnia becoming persistent and to avoid the development of complications. However, pharmacological strategies must achieve a balance between sedative and adverse effects. In the last 30 years, benzodiazepines have been the preferred drugs for the treatment of insomnia. Benzodiazepines act nonselectively at two central receptor sites, named omega(1) and omega(2), which are located in different areas of the CNS. The sedative action of benzodiazepines is related to omega(1) receptors, whereas omega(2) receptors are responsible for their effects on memory and cognitive functioning. According to their pharmacokinetic profile, benzodiazepines can be classified into three groups: short half-life (<3 hours), medium half-life (8-24 hours) and long half-life (>24 hours). The newer non-benzodiazepine agents zopiclone, zolpidem and zaleplon have a hypnosedative action comparable with that of benzodiazepines, but they display specific pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. These three 'Z' agents all share a short plasma half-life and limited duration of action. In addition, these agents are selective compounds that interact preferentially with omega(1) receptors (sedative effect), whereas benzodiazepines also interact with omega(2) receptors (adverse effects on cognitive performance and memory). Zaleplon is characterised by an ultrashort half-life (approximately 1 hour). Zolpidem and zopiclone have longer half-lives (approximately 2.4 and 5 hours, respectively). These properties, together with the low risk of residual effect, may explain the limited negative influences of these agents on daytime performance. Psychomotor tasks and memory capacities appear to be better preserved by non-benzodiazepine agents than by benzodiazepines. When present, cognitive deficits almost exclusively coincide with the peak plasma concentration. In particular, impairment can emerge in the first hours after drug administration, whereas psychomotor and memory tests carried out 7-8 hours later (i.e. in the morning) generally show no relevant alterations. As with benzodiazepines, the three 'Z' non-benzodiazepine agents should be used for a limited period, even in chronic relapsing conditions. Further evaluation is needed of the safety of hypnosedative medications in the long-term management of insomnia.","Efficacy of intermittent use of zolpidem has been demonstrated in clinical studies, a practice that could potentially decrease risk of side effects."
"What is the best test to diagnose urinary tract stones
To evaluate a low-dose, nonenhanced helical computed tomographic (CT) protocol in the detection of ureteric stones and measure the associated effective dose equivalent (H(E)) of radiation. Sixty patients suspected of having renal colic and referred by emergency department physicians underwent nonenhanced helical CT with 7-mm collimation and a 2:1 pitch and then conventional intravenous urography (IVU). The two studies were prospectively and independently interpreted. The diagnostic accuracy of CT for ureteric stone detection was determined by comparing the scans with the IVU images and with a combination of clinical, surgical, and other imaging findings. The radiation risk from typical CT and IVU examinations (five images) was measured in terms of H(E) and compared with the estimated risk from two previously reported CT protocols. CT correctly depicted 36 of 37 ureteric stones, and one false-positive case was recorded, for a sensitivity of 97%, specificity of 96%, and accuracy of 97%. The H(E) for our CT protocol was determined to be 2.8 mSv, which is about double that for IVU and about 75% and 50% of that for two previously reported CT protocols. Our low-dose CT protocol is superior to IVU and clinically adequate for diagnosis of renal colic.","The risk of contrast reaction during excretory urography is between 5% and 10%, with a mortality of approximately 1 in 40,000. Helical computerized tomography (when evaluating for stones) does not use contrast, although the radiation exposure is approximately twice that of IVP."
"What is the appropriate diagnostic evaluation of fibroids
To evaluate saline infusion sonohysterography as an investigative modality in abnormal uterine bleeding in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women. Fifty-eight patients, 52 perimenopausal and six postmenopausal women, with abnormal uterine bleeding were selected from the department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of Shrimati Sucheta Kriplani Hospital. After complete work-ups, transvaginal examinations were performed followed by sonohysterographies. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values and negative predictive values were calculated for transvaginal sonography (TVS) and saline infusion sonohysterography as compared with findings of hysteroscopy/hysterectomy. Saline infusion sonohysterography was performed in 56 cases. It could not be done in one perimenopausal and one postmenopausal woman. Cavity was normal in 41 perimenopausal and five postmenopausal women. Ten women displayed abnormalities. Two had submucosal fibroids, two had intramural fibroids, one had fibroid polyp, three had endometrial polyps and two patients had endometrial growths. We found that TVS missed three endometrial polyps and one endometrial growth and led to mislabeling two intramural fibroids as submucosal. On comparing the sonohysterographic findings with those of hysteroscopy or hysterectomy, one endometrial polyp and one endocervical polyp was missed on sonohysterography, and one false positive growth was observed on sonohysterography. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and the negative predictive value of TVS were 84.8%, 79%, 82.4% and 82%, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and the negative predictive value of saline infusion sonohysterography were 94.1%, 88.5%, 91.4% and 92%, respectively. Saline infusion sonohysterography is a safe, convenient, time conserving, cost effective, easily accessible and acceptable investigative modality. It definitely enhances the diagnostic potential of TVS in assessment of endometrium and intracavitary pathologies.",A prospective study of 56 symptomatic patients with a gold standard of hysteroscopic or surgical pathology similarly found sonohysterography to be superior to TVS.
"What effect do inhaled steroids have on delaying the progression of COPD
Early treatment with inhaled corticosteroids may prevent progression of irreversible obstruction in COPD, especially in patients with bronchial hyperresponsiveness. We investigated the clinical effects of early introduction of inhaled steroids in subjects showing early signs and symptoms of COPD without a prior clinical diagnosis. Study subjects were detected in a general population screening and monitoring program. Those with a moderately accelerated annual FEV1 decline and persistent respiratory symptoms were invited to participate in a 2-year randomized controlled trial comparing fluticasone propionate DPI 250 microg b.i.d. with placebo. Pre- and post-bronchodilator (BD) FEV1, PC20 histamine, functional status (COOP/WONCA charts) and occurrence of exacerbations were periodically assessed. Subjects recorded respiratory symptoms. Post-BD FEV1 decline served as the main outcome. Multivariable repeated measurements analysis techniques were applied. 48 subjects were randomized (24 fluticasone, 24 placebo). After 3 months, the post-BD FEV1 had increased with 125 ml (SE = 68, P = 0.075) and the pre-BD FEV1 with 174 ml (SE 90, P = 0.059) in the fluticasone relative to the placebo group. The subsequent post-BD and pre-BD FEV1 decline were not beneficially modified by fluticasone treatment. There were no statistically significant differences in respiratory symptoms, functional status, or exacerbations favoring fluticasone. Subgroup analysis indicated that the presence of bronchial hyperresponsiveness modified the initial FEV1 response on fluticasone, but not the subsequent annual FEV1 decline. Early initiation of inhaled steroid treatment does not seem to affect the progressive deterioration of lung function or other respiratory health outcomes in subjects with early signs and symptoms of COPD. In subjects at risk for, or in an early stage of COPD, long-term inhaled steroid treatment should not be based on a single spirometric evaluation after 3 months.","A trial evaluated post-bronchodilator FEV1 decline in 48 patients with early signs and symptoms of COPD for 2 years. Subjects were assigned to medium-dose fluticasone propionate or placebo. Early initiation of inhaled glucocorticosteroids treatment did not affect the progressive deterioration of lung function as no modifying effect on annual FEV1 decline was observed, however, the study only had power to detect a 60-mL annual drop in FEV1."
"What's the best way to manage athletes with amenorrhea
The effects of long-term triphasic oral contraceptive administration on bone mineral density (BMD) were investigated in premenopausal women with hypothalamic amenorrhea (HA) and osteopenia. After completing three 28-day cycles in the double-blind phase of a placebo-controlled trial, women (mean age, 26.7 years) who received norgestimate 180-250 microg/ethinyl estradiol 35 microg (NGM/EE, n = 15) or placebo (n = 12) in the double-blind phase were to receive open-label NGM/EE for 10 additional cycles. For subjects completing > or =10 NGM/EE treatment cycles, mean posteroanterior total lumbar spine BMD (L1-L4) increased from 0.881+/-0.0624 g/cm2 at baseline (last visit prior to NGM/EE) to 0.894+/-0.0654 g/cm2 at final visit (p = .043); no significant changes in hip BMD occurred. Decreases in N-telopeptide, osteocalcin, procollagen type I propeptide and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase levels indicated effects on bone metabolism. Long-term administration of triphasic NGM/EE to osteopenic women with HA may increase total lumbar spine BMD.","An open-label study that did examine bone mineral density (BMD) in women with hypothalamic amenorrhea before and after 13 cycles of oral contraceptives found a significant increase in bone mineral density in the spine, but not at the hip."
"What hormonal contraception is most effective for obese wome
A combined contraceptive vaginal ring designed to last 12 months was tested at three clinic sites. This ring released approximately 1 mg of norethindrone acetate (NET-Ac) and 20 micrograms of ethinyl estradiol (EE) daily. A total of 60 women were enrolled to use the ring in a schedule of 3 weeks in/1 week out. Serum norethindrone (NET) and ethinyl estradiol (EE) levels were assayed twice weekly in cycles 6, 9, and 13. Mean NET concentrations between cycles 6 and 9 were relatively stable between 13 and 19 nmol/L but showed a 10%-21% decrease in all centers between cycles 9 and 13. Mean EE concentrations ranged from 75 to 103 pmol/L, but did not have the same decrease as NET between cycles 9 and 13. Cycles with progesterone peaks (> 9.6 nmol/L) compatible with some luteal activity occurred in 4% of cycles sampled in Sydney, 3% in Santo Domingo, and 26% in Los Angeles. Half of these cycles exhibited at least one progesterone value > 32 nmol/L with three of 18 occurring in noncompliant cycles. Heavier body weight was associated with increased probability of luteal activity. Based on serum estradiol peaks > 400 pmol/L, eight of 81 cycles appeared to have marked follicular activity with no luteal activity. No pregnancies occurred. Nausea was reported by about half the subjects in approximately 10% of the visits (mainly in the first 1-2 days in the first cycle immediately after ring insertion). Vomiting was reported by 20% of subjects early in the first cycle only. Headache was reported on occasion by nearly 50% of the women, but the relationship to ring use was uncertain. Vaginal discharge was reported by 17 women (82% of these were from one clinic). Of 60 women, 14 discontinued before completing the study, but only two discontinuations were for medical reasons. Small but statistically significant changes occurred in lipid levels in two of the three centers. All changes remained within normal limits and were similar to those seen with many oral contraceptives. It appears that this ring may perform slightly differently in different populations, but is a highly satisfactory method of contraception for many women. Minor modifications in design could provide higher levels of steroid release and in the later months of the ring life span would assure continuing high levels of contraceptive protection for heavier women. This study determines the ovarian effects, contraceptive efficacy, and effects  on serum levels of norethindrone acetate (NET-Ac) and ethinyl estradiol (EE)  among women using a single contraceptive vaginal ring (CVR) cyclically over a  period of 1 year.  A total of 60 women were enrolled and used the ring according  to a schedule of 3 weeks ""in"" and 1 week ""out.""  Assays of serum norethindrone  acetate (NET-Ac) ethinyl estradiol (EE) levels were taken twice weekly in cycles  6, 9, and 13.  Despite luteal activity in some cycles, no pregnancies were noted  within the 12-month study period.  Heavier body weight was associated with  increased probability of luteal activity.  Mean serum levels decreased over the  last 3 months of CVR use, accounting for the increase in luteal activity and  possible ovulations in cycle 13.  Among women in Sydney, by contrast with women  in the other centers, a difference in the effect on lipids was seen.  However,  the changes in lipid levels were very small.  The side effects were a little  different from those experienced by women using a combined  pill.  Nausea and  vomiting were largely confined to early cycles and most common in the first days  of the first cycle.  Weight gain was also not a problem, although there was a  small mean increase in body weight over the 12-month treatment period.  This  study indicates that use of a single CVR releasing EE and NET-Ac over a period  of 12 months constitutes an acceptable, safe and effective contraceptive method.","A higher body weight appeared to be associated with increased likelihood of ovulation using the contraceptive vaginal ring, though it did not lead to any pregnancies in a multicenter study."
"What hormonal contraception is most effective for obese wome
To assess the efficacy and safety of Seasonale, 91-day extended cycle oral contraceptive (OC). A parallel, randomized, multicenter open-label, 1-year study of the OC Seasonale [30 microg ethinyl estradiol (EE)/150 microg levonorgestrel (LNG), and Nordette-28 (30 microg EE/150 microg LNG)] in sexually active, adult women (18-40 years) of childbearing potential. Patients received either four 91-day cycles of extended cycle regimen OC, or 13 cycles of the conventional 28-day OC with daily monitoring of compliance and bleeding via electronic diaries. When taken daily for 84 days followed by 7 days of placebo, the extended cycle regimen was effective in preventing pregnancy and had a safety profile that was comparable to that observed with the 28-day OC regimen that served as the control. While unscheduled (breakthrough) bleeding was reported among patients treated with the extended cycle regimen, it decreased with each successive cycle of therapy and was comparable to that reported by patients who received the conventional OC regimen by the fourth extended cycle. This study demonstrated that Seasonale, 91-day extended cycle OC containing 84 days of 30 microg EE/150 microg LNG followed by 7 days of placebo, was effective, safe and well tolerated.","In a randomized trial studying the efficacy of an extended-cycle oral contraceptive (Seasonale), no woman weighing >90 kg became pregnant."
"What interventions can help patients stop using chewing tobacco
Use of smokeless tobacco (ST) can lead to nicotine addiction and health problems including periodontal disease and oral cancer To assess the effects of behavioural and pharmacotherapeutic interventions to treat ST use. We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group trials register (February 2004), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2004), MEDLINE (January 1966-February 2004), EMBASE (1988-January 2004), CINAHL (1982-February 2004), PsycINFO (1984-February 2004), Database of Abstract of Reviews of Effectiveness (DARE, The Cochrane Library, Issue 1, 2004). Randomized trials of behavioural or pharmacological interventions to help users of ST to quit, with follow-up of at least six months. Two authors independently extracted data. One trial of bupropion did not detect a benefit of treatment after six months (Odds Ratio (OR) 1.00, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.23 to 4.37). Three trials of nicotine patch did not detect a benefit (OR 1.16, 95% CI: 0.88 to 1.54), nor did two trials of nicotine gum (OR 0.98, 95% CI: 0.59 to 1.63). There was statistical heterogeneity among the results of eight trials of behavioural interventions included in the meta-analysis. Three trials showed significant benefits of intervention. In a post-hoc analysis the trials of interventions which included an oral examination and feedback about ST-induced mucosal changes had homogeneous results and when pooled showed a significant benefit (OR 2.41 95% CI: 1.79 to 3.24). Behavioural interventions should be used to help ST users to quit. Pharmacotherapies have not been shown to affect long-term abstinence but larger trials are needed.","A meta-analysis of 6 studies that examined nicotine replacement therapy or bupropion in smokeless tobacco users. The primary outcome for the meta-analysis was tobacco abstinence 6 months or more after the intervention. Neither nicotine patches (odds ratio [OR]=1.16; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.88-1.54) nor nicotine gum (OR=0.98; 95% CI, 0.59-1.63) were shown to improve abstinence over placebo at 6 months."
"Does the age you introduce food to an infant affect allergies later
Allergies and food reactions are common and may be associated with foods including adapted cow's milk formula. Formulas containing hydrolysed proteins have been used to treat infants with allergy or food intolerance. However, it is unclear whether hydrolysed formula can be advocated for prevention of allergy and food intolerance in infants without evidence of allergy or food intolerance. To determine the effect of feeding hydrolysed formulas on allergy and food intolerance in infants and children compared to adapted cow's milk or human breast milk. If hydrolysed formulas are effective, to determine what type of hydrolysed formula is most effective including extensively and partially hydrolysed formulas. To determine which infants benefit, including infants at low or high risk of allergy and infants receiving early, short term or prolonged formula feeding. The standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group was used. The review was updated with searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 1, 2006), MEDLINE (1966-March 2006), EMBASE (1980-March 2006) and CINAHL (1982-March 2006) and previous reviews including cross references. Randomised and quasi-randomised trials that compare the use of a hydrolysed infant formula to human milk or cow's milk formula. Trials with >80% follow up of participants were eligible for inclusion. Eligibility of studies for inclusion, methodological quality and data extraction were assessed independently by each review author. Primary outcomes included clinical allergy, specific allergies and food intolerance. Meta-analysis was conducted using a fixed effects model. Two trials compared early, short term hydrolysed formula to human milk feeding. No significant difference in infant allergy or childhood cow's milk allergy (CMA) were reported. No eligible trial compared prolonged hydrolysed formula to human milk feeding. Two trials compared early, short term hydrolysed formula to cow's milk formula feeding. No significant benefits were reported. One large quasi-random study reported a reduction in infant CMA of borderline significance in low risk infants (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.38, 1.00). Ten eligible studies compared prolonged feeding with hydrolysed formula versus cow's milk formula in high risk infants. Meta-analysis found a significant reduction in infant allergy (seven studies, 2514 infants; typical RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.66, 0.94), but not in the incidence of childhood allergy (two studies, 950 infants; typical RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.69, 1.05). There was no significant difference in infant eczema (eight studies, 2558 infants, typical RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.68, 1.04), childhood eczema incidence (two studies, 950 infants, typical RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.63, 1.10), childhood eczema prevalence (one study, 872 infants; RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.43, 1.02), or infant or childhood asthma, rhinitis and food allergy. One study reported a significant reduction in infants with CMA with confirmed atopy (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.15, 0.89). Subgroup analysis of trials blinded to formula found no significant difference in infant allergy (four studies, 2156 infants; typical RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.69, 1.08) or childhood allergy incidence (one study, 872 infants; RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.73, 1.14). No eligible trial examined the effect of prolonged hydrolysed formula feeding on allergy beyond early childhood. There is evidence that preterm or low birthweight infants fed a hydrolysed preterm formula have significantly reduced weight gain, but not in other growth parameters (head circumference or length). Studies in term infants report no adverse effects on growth. Subgroup analysis of trials of partially hydrolysed versus cow's milk formula found a significant reduction in infant allergy (six studies, 1391 infants; typical RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.65, 0.97) but not childhood allergy, or infant or childhood asthma, eczema or rhinitis. Methodological concerns were the same as for the overall analysis. Analysis of trials of extensively hydrolysed formula versus cow's milk formula found no significant differences in allergy or food intolerance. Infants fed extensively hydrolysed formula compared with partially hydrolysed formula had a significant reduction in food allergy (two studies, 341 infants; typical RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.19, 0.99), but there was no significant difference in all allergy or any other specific allergy incidence. Comparing extensively hydrolysed casein containing formula with cow's milk formula, one study (431 infants) reported a significant reduction in childhood allergy incidence (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.53, 0.97). Meta-analysis found a significant reduction in infant eczema (three studies, 1237 infants; typical RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.51, 0.97). One study reported a significant reduction in childhood eczema incidence (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.44, 0.98) and prevalence (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.27, 0.92). There is no evidence to support feeding with a hydrolysed formula for the prevention of allergy compared to exclusive breast feeding. In high risk infants who are unable to be completely breast fed, there is limited evidence that prolonged feeding with a hydrolysed formula compared to a cow's milk formula reduces infant and childhood allergy and infant CMA. In view of methodological concerns and inconsistency of findings, further large, well designed trials comparing formulas containing partially hydrolysed whey, or extensively hydrolysed casein to cow's milk formulas are needed.",Studies have not found a significant difference among these forms of milk for infants without a strong family history of atopic disease.
"Does treatment of acne with Retin A and tetracycline cause adverse effects
Despite anecdotal evidence of a possibility of decreased effectiveness of oral contraceptives (OCs) with some antibiotics, it is not known whether antibiotic use in dermatologic practices engenders any increased risk of accidental pregnancy. Our purpose was to examine the effect of commonly prescribed oral antibiotics (tetracyclines, penicillins, cephalosporins) on the failure rate of OCs. The records from three dermatology practices were reviewed, and 356 patients with a history of combined oral antibiotic/OC use were surveyed retrospectively. Of these patients, 263 also provided ""control"" data (during the times they used OCs alone). An additional 162 patients provided control data only. Five pregnancies occurred in 311 woman-years of combined antibiotic/OC exposure (1.6% per year failure rate) compared with 12 pregnancies in 1245 woman-years of exposure (0.96% per year) for the 425 control patients. This difference was not significant (p = 0.4), and the 95% confidence interval on the difference (-0.81, 2.1) ruled out a substantial difference (> 2.1% per year). There was also no significant difference between OC failure rates for the women who provided data under both conditions, nor between the two control groups. All our data groups had failure rates below the 3% or higher per year, which are typically found in the United States. The difference in failure rates of OCs when taken concurrently with antibiotics commonly used in dermatology versus OC use alone suggests that these antibiotics do not increase the risk of pregnancy. Physicians and patients need to recognize that the expected OC failure rate, regardless of antibiotic use, is at least 1% per year and it is not yet possible to predict in whom OCs may fail. Although some antibiotics are assumed to compromise the effectiveness of oral contraceptives (OCs), it is unknown whether the antibiotics used in dermatologic practice are associated with such a risk.  To address this issue, a review was conducted in three US dermatologic practices of the records of 356 patients with a history of combined oral antibiotic/OC use in 1990-95 who responded to a follow-up questionnaire.  263 of these patients provided control data during the times they used OCs alone and an additional 162 patients were controls only.  There were five pregnancies in 311 woman-years of combined antibiotic/OC exposure (1.6% annual failure rate) compared with 12 pregnancies in 1245 woman-years of exposure among controls (0.96% annual failure rate)--a nonsignificant difference.  In addition, there were no significant differences between OC failure rates among women who served as both cases and controls or between the two control groups.  All five cases who became pregnant had been taking an antibiotic (microcycline or a cephalosporin) for at least 3 months.  Side effects potentially linked to reduced OC effectiveness (e.g., diarrhea, breakthrough menstrual bleeding) were not reported by the women who became pregnant.  It is presumed that inter-individual differences in steroid plasma levels are a more important cause of OC failure than concomitant antibiotic therapy.","A relatively large retrospective cohort study of oral contraceptive users in a dermatological practice showed no difference in contraceptive failure rates between those prescribed common antibiotics (including tetracycline) and controls (1.6% vs 0.96%; 95% confidence interval [CI] for the difference, 0.81-2.1)."
"Do antibiotics prevent recurrent urinary tract infection in children with anatomic abnormalities
The aim, in conservative management of vesico-ureteric reflux by antimicrobial prophylaxis, is to prevent recurrent febrile urinary tract infections and consequent renal scarring. However, the effects of this prophylactic strategy are difficult to evaluate, since the required studies comparing children on prophylaxis with controls (without prophylaxis but under careful supervision) are lacking. Furthermore, the optimal length of prophylaxis needs to be defined. Since risk of renal scarring is believed to occur more frequently in young people, and since recurrent urinary infections mainly affect girls, the age and sex of subjects are important in the design of a prophylactic regimen. Nitrofurantoin and trimethoprim are the most common agents used for long-term, low-dose antibacterial prophylaxis. Break-through infections still result from non-compliance and from development of bacterial resistance, the latter mainly arising with trimethoprim. Few studies of prophylactic drugs are available that adequately define patient materials and include a random allocation to the different agents. Further studies of the effects of alternative prophylactic agents are called for, preferably combined with fresh insight into the ecological impact on the bowel and periurethral floras.",No randomized controlled trials assess whether prophylaxis prevents the development of new renal scars in children.
"What treatment works best for tennis elbow
To evaluate the available evidence of the effectiveness of physiotherapy for lateral epicondylitis of the elbow. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) identified by a highly sensitive search strategy in six databases in combination with reference checking. Two independent reviewers selected RCTs that included a physiotherapy intervention, patients with lateral epicondylitis, and at least one clinically relevant outcome measure. No language restrictions were made. Methodological quality was independently assessed by two blinded reviewers. A best evidence synthesis, including a quantitative and qualitative analysis, was conducted, weighting the studies with respect to their internal validity, statistical significance, clinical relevance, and statistical power. 23 RCTs were included in the review, evaluating the effects of lasertherapy, ultrasound treatment, electrotherapy, and exercises and mobilisation techniques. Fourteen studies satisfied at least 50% of the internal validity criteria. Except for ultrasound, pooling of data from RCTs was not possible because of insufficient data, or clinical or statistical heterogeneity. The pooled estimate of the treatment effects of two studies on ultrasound compared to placebo ultrasound, showed statistically significant and clinically relevant differences in favour of ultrasound. There is insufficient evidence either to demonstrate benefit or lack of effect of lasertherapy, electrotherapy, exercises and mobilisation techniques for lateral epicondylitis. Despite the large number of studies, there is still insufficient evidence for most physiotherapy interventions for lateral epicondylitis due to contradicting results, insufficient power, and the low number of studies per intervention. Only for ultrasound, weak evidence for efficacy was found. More better designed, conducted and reported RCTs are needed.","Pooling 2 studies in a different systematic review showed weak evidence that ultrasound reduced pain at 13 weeks compared with placebo (standardized mean difference=-0.98; 95% CI, -1.64 to -0.33)."
"When are empiric antibiotics appropriate for urinary tract infection symptoms
Guidelines for the management of acute cystitis support empirical antibiotic treatment; however, up to half of symptomatic women have negative urine cultures. To determine whether empirical treatment leads to unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions in women with symptoms of acute cystitis. A cohort of 231 women (defined as females aged 16 years and older) presenting to family physicians' offices with symptoms of cystitis underwent a standardized clinical assessment, urine dip testing, and culture. Recommendations for urine testing and antibiotic treatment under 3 empirical strategies were compared with observed physician management and a logistic regression model for the outcomes of antibiotic prescriptions, urine culture testing, and unnecessary antibiotics, defined as a prescription where the subsequent urine culture was negative. There were 123 positive urine cultures (53.3%). Physicians prescribed antibiotics to 186 women (80.9%), of whom 74 (39.8%) were culture negative. Unnecessary antibiotic use was similar for 2 guidelines recommending empirical antibiotic treatment without testing for pyuria (41.4% and 40.6%). Treating women with classic cystitis symptoms and pyuria would have decreased unnecessary antibiotic use (26.2%; P =.02) but resulted in fewer women with confirmed urinary tract infection receiving immediate antibiotics (66.4% vs 91.8% usual care; P<.001). A derived prediction model incorporating testing for pyuria and nitrites would also have reduced unnecessary antibiotic use (27.5%; P =.03), but more women with confirmed urinary tract infection would have received immediate antibiotics (81.3%; P =.01). Empirical antibiotic treatment of acute cystitis in women without testing for pyuria promotes unnecessary antibiotic use. A simple decision rule provides for prompt treatment of infected women while reducing antibiotic overuse and unnecessary urine testing.","McIssac et al reviewed a cohort of 231 women presenting to family physicians' offices with uncomplicated cystitis symptoms. Empiric therapy resulted in approximately 40% of women unnecessarily receiving antibiotics. Treating only women with classic cystitis symptoms and pyuria would have decreased the unnecessary use of antibiotics to 26.2%, but fewer women with confirmed cystitis would have received immediate antibiotics (66.4% vs 91.8%). They derived a clinical decision rule designed to balance false positives and false negatives. It recommends immediate antibiotic treatment if women have ≥2 of 4 signs or symptoms: dysuria, leukocyte esterase (greater than trace), positive nitrites, or blood (greater than trace) on dipstick (LR+=2.29). Otherwise the rule recommends a culture to guide antibiotic therapy. This decision rule would have reduced unnecessary antibiotic use by 27.5% while ensuring that more women with confirmed UTIs received immediate antibiotics (81.3%)."
"How do you evaluate macrocytosis without anemia
Adult patients with macrocytosis, defined as a mean corpuscular volume (MCV) greater than 100 femtoliters, were studied to assess the importance of an elevated MCV. After eliminating pregnant and postpartum patients and patients receiving medications known to cause macrocytosis (e.g., phenytoin, zidovudine, and chemotherapeutic agents), 80 patients were identified and studied. Sixty-seven diagnoses were made in 56 patients. These diagnoses were, in descending order: alcoholism, hematological disorders, habitual drinking, B12 deficiency, chronic liver disease, folic acid deficiency, hypothyroidism, anorexia nervosa, and reticulocytosis. While an elevated MCV is neither sensitive nor specific for any one disease state, an elevated MCV should raise suspicions of underlying pathology.",A prospective study of primary care patients found that reticulocytosis rarely caused macrocytosis.
"At what age do patients no longer need colorectal cancer screening
All 68,308 inhabitants of Göteborg born between 1918 and 1931 were randomly divided into a test and a control group. The subjects in the test group were invited to perform Hemoccult II fecal occult blood testing on 3 days and to repeat the test after 16 to 24 months. In the prevalence screening 21,347 (63%) performed the test, and in the rescreening 19,991 (60%). Investigation of the 942 (4.4%) with positive tests in the prevalence screening showed 47 cancers and 129 subjects with adenomas > or = 1.0 cm. In the rescreening 5.1% had a positive test, and 34 cancers and 122 subjects with adenomas (> or = 1.0 cm) were found among those. Cancer had also been diagnosed in 19 subjects in the interval between the two screening occasions and in 15 subjects among the non-responders. Forty-four cancers had been diagnosed in the control group during the same period. Cancers detected by screening were at a less advanced stage than in the control group. It is too early to show any effect of screening on mortality from colorectal cancer.",The upper age limits of patients was 64.
"What is the best way to treat tinea cruris
In separate multicentre, randomized, double-blind clinical trials, 1% ciclopirox olamine cream was compared with its cream vehicle and with 1% clotrimazole cream as treatment for tinea corporis and tinea cruris. Patients who demonstrated clinical and mycological findings consistent with the diagnoses of tinea corporis or tinea cruris were included in the study. Clinical and mycological evaluations were made pretreatment, at the end of each of the four weeks of treatment, and weekly for the two weeks immediately following cessation of treatment. In both studies, use of ciclopirox olamine cream resulted in demonstrable improvements after the first week of therapy and in complete clinical and mycological clearing in two thirds of the patients at the end of the treatment period. These results were maintained through the two-week drug-free observation period that followed the end of treatment. Statistically, the results with ciclopirox olamine cream were significantly better than those with the vehicle and were equivalent to those with clotrimazole cream. All treatments were well tolerated.","Ajoene 0.6% gel (isolated from garlic), was as effective as terbinafine 1% cream (both applied twice daily for 2 weeks) in a randomized controlled trials of 60 Venezuelan Army soldiers. Sixty days after treatment, 73% of the Ajoene-treated patients and 71% in the terbinafine group were asymptomatic."
"What are effective medical treatments for adults with acute migraine
Many therapies are used in the treatment of acute migraine headache, with little agreement on effectiveness. This systematic review is designed to determine the effectiveness of parenteral dihydroergotamine in reducing pain, nausea, and relapse for episodes of acute migraine in adults. Randomized controlled trials were identified using MEDLINE, EMBASE, other computerized databases, hand searching, bibliographies, and contacts with industry and authors. Studies in which dihydroergotamine (alone or in combination with an antiemetic) was compared with placebo or any other common migraine therapy were considered. Relevance, inclusion, and study quality were assessed independently by 2 reviewers. From 281 potentially relevant abstracts, 11 studies met the inclusion criteria. Solitary dihydroergotamine use was compared to sumatriptan and phenothiazines in 3 studies; results failed to demonstrate a significant benefit of dihydroergotamine over these therapies. In 8 combination treatment studies, heterogeneity in study methodology prevented statistical pooling. However, dihydroergotamine administered with an antiemetic was as effective as or more effective than meperidine, valproate, or ketorolac across all pain, nausea, and relapse outcomes reported in all studies. This evidence suggests that dihydroergotamine is not as effective as sumatriptan or phenothiazines as a single agent for treatment of acute migraine headache; however, when administered with an antiemetic, dihydroergotamine appears to be as effective as opiates, ketorolac, or valproate. Given its nonnarcotic properties, parenteral dihydroergotamine combined with an antiemetic should be considered as effective initial therapy in clinical practice.","A systematic review revealed that dihydroergotamine (DHE) alone was less effective than subcutaneous sumatriptan in migraine pain reduction (OR=0.44; 95% CI, 0.25-0.77) or headache resolution (OR=0.05; 95% CI, 0.01-0.42). No differences were seen between dihydroergotamine alone and chlorpromazine or lidocaine. Three studies revealed dihydroergotamine plus metoclopramide was more effective than or equal to other agents for headache pain reduction at 2 hours: one vs ketorolac infectious mononucleosis (OR=7; 95% CI, 0.86-56.89), one vs meperidine (Demerol) plus hydroxyzine (Vistaril, Atarax) infectious mononucleosis (OR=47.67; 95% CI, 4.32-526.17), and one vs valproate IV (OR=0.67; 95% CI, 0.19-2.33). Specifically, treatment with dihydroergotamine plus metoclopramide was superior to ketorolac for pain reduction (P=.03), but patients did not differ in disability scores (P=.06). dihydroergotamine plus metoclopramide achieved greater reductions in pain scale scores than meperidine plus hydroxyzine (P<.001). No significant difference in pain reduction was noted between dihydroergotamine plus metoclopramide and valproate (P=.36)."
"Does lowering diastolic blood pressure to less than 90 mm Hg decrease cardiovascular risk
Population-based longitudinal studies of hypertension have usually shown a continuous and positive relationship between blood pressure and mortality. However, several studies in hypertensive patients receiving treatment have described this relationship as J-shaped, with an increased risk for events in patients with low blood pressure. To assess the evidence for a J-shaped relationship between blood pressure and mortality and its relation to treatment. Meta-analysis of individual-patient data. Seven randomized clinical trials from the INDANA (INdividual Data ANalysis of Antihypertensive intervention) database. 40 233 persons with hypertension (mean follow-up, 3.9 years). Primarily beta-blockers or thiazide diuretics versus placebo or no treatment. Diastolic and systolic blood pressure and number of cardiovascular, noncardiovascular, and all-cause deaths in yearly periods of follow-up. The analysis included data on 1655 deaths (56% cardiovascular). A J-shaped relationship between diastolic blood pressure and risk for death was observed for total and cardiovascular mortality in treated patients (nadir, 84 and 80 mm Hg, respectively) and untreated patients (nadir, 90 and 85 mm Hg, respectively). For noncardiovascular deaths, the relationship was J-shaped in the treated group (nadir, 84 mm Hg) and negative in the control group. Similar results were observed for systolic blood pressure. The presence of patients with wide pulse pressure did not explain these findings. The increased risk for events observed in patients with low blood pressure was not related to antihypertensive treatment and was not specific to blood pressure-related events. Poor health conditions leading to low blood pressure and an increased risk for death probably explain the J-shaped curve.","A meta-analysis of 7 randomized controlled trials involving 40,233 hypertensive patients used statistical modeling to determine the shape of the ""mortality curve"" over a range of diastolic blood pressure categories, defined in 10-mm Hg increments from 65 to 106. The subjects received mainly beta-blockers or thiazide diuretics; controls received placebo or no treatment. Both groups demonstrated increased risk for cardiovascular and all-cause death at the lowest diastolic blood pressure levels. Among treated patients, overall death rate was lowest with a diastolic blood pressure in the range of 76 to 85 mm Hg; among controls the nadir was 86 to 95 mm Hg."
"What is the preferred treatment for a child with mild persistent asthma
Anti-leukotrienes agents are currently being studied as alternative first line agents to inhaled corticosteroids in mild to moderate chronic asthma. To compare the safety and efficacy of anti-leukotriene agents with inhaled glucocorticoids (ICS) and to determine the dose-equivalence of anti-leukotrienes to daily dose of ICS. We searched MEDLINE (1966 to Aug 2003), EMBASE (1980 to Aug 2003), CINAHL (1982 to Aug 2003), the Cochrane Airways Group trials register, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (August 2003), abstract books, and reference lists of review articles and trials. We contacted colleagues and international headquarters of anti-leukotrienes producers. Randomised controlled trials that compared anti-leukotrienes with inhaled corticosteroids during a minimal 30-day intervention period in asthmatic patients aged 2 years and older. Two reviewers independently assessed the methodological quality or trials and extracted trial data. The primary outcome was the rate of exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroids. Secondary outcomes included lung function, indices of chronic asthma control, adverse effects and withdrawal rates. 27 trials (including 1 trial testing two protocols) met the inclusion criteria; 13 were of high methodological quality; 20 are published in full-text. All trials pertained to patients with mild to moderate persistent asthma. Only 3 trials focused on children and adolescents. Trial duration varied from 4 to 37 weeks. In most trials, daily dose of ICS was 400 mcg of beclomethasone or equivalent. Patients treated with anti-leukotrienes were 65% more likely to suffer an exacerbation requiring systemic steroids [Relative Risk 1.65; 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 1.36 to 2.00]. Twenty six (95% CI: 17 to 47) patients must be treated with anti-leukotrienes instead of inhaled corticosteroids to cause one extra exacerbation. Significant differences favouring ICS were noted in secondary outcomes where()the improvement in FEV(1) reached 130 mL [13 trials; 95% CI: 50, 140 mL ]. Other significant benefits of ICS were seen for symptoms, nocturnal awakenings, rescue medication use, symptom-free days, and quality of life. Anti-leukotriene therapy was associated with 160% increased risk of withdrawals due to poor asthma control. Twenty nine (95% CI 20 to 48) patients must be treated with anti-leukotrienes instead of inhaled corticosteroids to cause one extra withdrawal due to poor control. Risk of side effects was not different between groups. Inhaled steroids at a dose of 400 mcg/day of beclomethasone or equivalent are more effective than anti-leukotriene agents given in the usual licensed doses. The exact dose-equivalence of anti-leukotriene agents in mcg of ICS remains to be determined. Inhaled glucocorticoids should remain the first line monotherapy for persistent asthma.","A systematic review of 15 trials reported that the protective effect of leukotriene receptor antagonists is inferior to inhaled corticosteroids for adults (relative risk [RR]=1.71; 95% CI, 1.40-2.09); however, evidence is insufficient to extrapolate this to children."
"How can you help prevent a recurrence of diverticulitis
Patients with diverticular disease are frequently advised to avoid eating nuts, corn, popcorn, and seeds to reduce the risk of complications. However, there is little evidence to support this recommendation. To determine whether nut, corn, or popcorn consumption is associated with diverticulitis and diverticular bleeding. The Health Professionals Follow-up Study is a cohort of US men followed up prospectively from 1986 to 2004 via self-administered questionnaires about medical (biennial) and dietary (every 4 years) information. Men reporting newly diagnosed diverticulosis or diverticulitis were mailed supplemental questionnaires. The study included 47,228 men aged 40 to 75 years who at baseline were free of diverticulosis or its complications, cancer, and inflammatory bowel disease and returned a food-frequency questionnaire. Incident diverticulitis and diverticular bleeding. During 18 years of follow-up, there were 801 incident cases of diverticulitis and 383 incident cases of diverticular bleeding. We found inverse associations between nut and popcorn consumption and the risk of diverticulitis. The multivariate hazard ratios for men with the highest intake of each food (at least twice per week) compared with men with the lowest intake (less than once per month) were 0.80 (95% confidence interval, 0.63-1.01; P for trend = .04) for nuts and 0.72 (95% confidence interval, 0.56-0.92; P for trend = .007) for popcorn. No associations were seen between corn consumption and diverticulitis or between nut, corn, or popcorn consumption and diverticular bleeding or uncomplicated diverticulosis. In this large, prospective study of men without known diverticular disease, nut, corn, and popcorn consumption did not increase the risk of diverticulosis or diverticular complications. The recommendation to avoid these foods to prevent diverticular complications should be reconsidered.","A trial conducted as part of a large prospective cohort study-the Health Professionals Follow-up Study-followed 47,228 male health professionals in the United States, ages 40 to 75 years, from 1986 to 2004. The subjects, all of whom returned a food-frequency questionnaire, were at baseline free of diverticulosis and related complications, cancer, and inflammatory bowel disease. During the follow-up period, 801 cases of diverticulitis and 383 cases of diverticular bleeding (the main outcome measures) occurred. The investigators found an inverse association between consumption of nuts and popcorn and risk of diverticulitis. Men with the highest intake of each food (at least twice per week) compared with men with the lowest intake (less than once per month) had a hazard ratio of 0.80 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.63-1.01; P for trend=.04) for nuts and 0.72 (95% CI, 0.56-0.92; P for trend=.007) for popcorn.

"What behavioral interventions are safe and effective for treating obesity
Forty-nine obese diabetic patients with obese spouses (diabetic or nondiabetic) were randomly assigned to an alone or together condition. Patients in the alone group participated by themselves in a 20-week behavioral weight control program; their spouses attended assessment sessions only. Patients in the together group attended the program with their spouses; both were targeted for weight loss and taught social support strategies. Weight losses of patients treated alone and together did not differ significantly at posttreatment (19.9 vs. 19.1 lb) or 1-year follow-up (11.6 vs. 7.0 lb). However, there was a significant interaction of treatment and gender; women did better when treated with their spouses, whereas men did better when treated alone. A ""family-based"" approach was not effective for these obese Type II diabetic patients as a whole but may be helpful for women.","One randomized controlled trials involved 163 patients and compared behavioral therapy alone with behavioral therapy plus specific aids to changing diet: use of grocery lists, meal plans, and specific instructions to reduce total fat intake. The average weight loss after 1 year in the behavioral therapy with specific aids group, was statistically significantly greater than the weight loss in the behavioral therapy alone group 6.9 kg vs 3.3 kg."
"Does warfarin prevent deep venous thrombosis in high-risk patients
Patients receiving chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer are at high risk of thromboembolic disease. Long-term oral anticoagulant therapy is needed but increases the risk of haemorrhagic complications. We have assessed the safety and efficacy of warfarin in very low doses as prophylaxis. Women receiving chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer were randomly assigned either very-low-dose warfarin (152 patients) or placebo (159). The warfarin dose was 1 mg daily for 6 weeks and was then adjusted to maintain the prothrombin time at an international normalised ratio (INR) of 1.3 to 1.9. Study treatment continued until 1 week after the end of chemotherapy. The average daily dose from initiation of titration was 2.6 (SD 1.2) mg for the warfarin group and the mean INR was 1.52. The mean time at risk of thrombosis was 199 (126) days for warfarin-treated patients and 188 (137) days for placebo recipients (p = 0.45). There were 7 thromboembolic events (6 deep-vein thrombosis, 1 pulmonary embolism) in the placebo group and 1 (pulmonary embolism) in the warfarin group, a relative risk reduction of about 85% (p = 0.031). Major bleeding occurred in 2 placebo recipients and 1 warfarin-treated patient. There was no detectable difference in survival between the treatment groups. Very-low-dose warfarin is a safe and effective method for prevention of thromboembolism in patients with metastatic breast cancer who are receiving chemotherapy.","In patients with cancer, warfarin was shown to be more effective than placebo in prevention of DVT. In a trial of 311 breast cancer patients receiving chemotherapy, treatment with very-low-dose warfarin INR=1.3-1.9 decreased thrombotic events compared with placebo, with no increase in bleeding complications RRR=85%; P=.031; NNT=27."
"What is the most effective management of acute fractures of the base of the fifth metatarsal
To understand better the natural history of fractures of the fifth metatarsal, a fracture registry was established consisting of patients who had acute fractures of the fifth metatarsal. The first 100 patients were studied to develop data on the natural history of injuries to this bone, and on the results of standard treatment for those injuries. In this study, 3 fracture subtypes were identified: avulsion, true Jones' fracture, and shaft/neck fracture. Avulsion fractures healed without immobilization, usually in 4 weeks. Shaft/neck fractures healed in plaster casts with weight bearing as tolerated in 4 to 6 weeks. True Jones' fractures required a prolonged time to heal when treated with 8 weeks of nonweight bearing and then weight bearing as tolerated in a cast. This method was, however, successful in 72% of patients (average time until union, 21.2 weeks). For the 7 patients in whom conservative treatment failed, surgical fixation at an average of 25 weeks after injury reliably achieved bony union in half the time required with cast treatment. This low-risk procedure met with higher patient satisfaction than prolonged casting.",A prospective registry of 68 consecutive acute Jones' fractures in primarily young military service members showed a 72% union rate with non-weightbearing short leg casting with average time to union of 21.2 weeks.
"What is the best treatment for mild to moderate acne
Management of acne vulgaris by nondermatologists is increasing. Current understanding of the different presentations of acne allows for individualized treatments and improved outcomes. To review the best evidence available for individualized treatment of acne. Search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane database to search for all English-language articles on acne treatment from 1966 to 2004. Well-designed randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses, and other systematic reviews are the focus of this article. Acne literature is characterized by a lack of standardization with respect to outcome measures and methods used to grade disease severity. Main outcome measures of 29 randomized double-blind trials that were evaluated included reductions in inflammatory, noninflammatory, and total acne lesion counts. Topical retinoids reduce the number of comedones and inflammatory lesions in the range of 40% to 70%. These agents are the mainstay of therapy in patients with comedones only. Other agents, including topical antimicrobials, oral antibiotics, hormonal therapy (in women), and isotretinoin all yield high response rates. Patients with mild to moderate severity inflammatory acne with papules and pustules should be treated with topical antibiotics combined with retinoids. Oral antibiotics are first-line therapy in patients with moderate to severe inflammatory acne while oral isotretinoin is indicated for severe nodular acne, treatment failures, scarring, frequent relapses, or in cases of severe psychological distress. Long-term topical or oral antibiotic therapy should be avoided when feasible to minimize occurrence of bacterial resistance. Isotretinoin is a powerful teratogen mandating strict precautions for use among women of childbearing age. Acne responses to treatment vary considerably. Frequently more than 1 treatment modality is used concomitantly. Best results are seen when treatments are individualized on the basis of clinical presentation.",A systematic review evaluating the evidence for treatment of acne found that combining topical antibiotics with topical retinoids or benzoyl peroxide is effective for moderate noninflammatory (come-donal) and mild to moderate inflammatory (papulopustular) acne.
"What's the best way to motivate patients to exercise
The majority of children do not participate in sufficient amounts of daily, health-enhancing physical activity. One strategy to increase activity is to promote it within the after-school setting. Although promising, the effectiveness of this strategy is unclear. A systematic review was performed summarizing the research conducted to date regarding the effectiveness of after-school programs in increasing physical activity. Databases, journals, and review articles were searched for articles published between 1980 and February 2008. Meta-analysis was conducted during July of 2008. Included articles had the following characteristics: findings specific to an after-school intervention in the school setting; subjects aged <or=18 years; an intervention component designed to promote physical activity; outcome measures of physical activity, related constructs, and/or physical fitness. Study outcomes were distilled into six domains: physical activity, physical fitness, body composition, blood lipids, psychosocial constructs, and sedentary activities. Effect sizes (Hedge's g) were calculated within and across studies for each domain, separately. Of the 797 articles found, 13 unique articles describing findings from 11 after-school interventions were reviewed. Although physical activity was a primary component of all the tested interventions, only eight studies measured physical activity. From the six domains, positive effect sizes were demonstrated for physical activity (0.44 [95% CI=0.28-0.60]); physical fitness (0.16 [95% CI=0.01-0.30]); body composition (0.07 [95% CI=0.03-0.12]); and blood lipids (0.20 [95% CI=0.06-0.33]). The limited evidence suggests that after-school programs can improve physical activity levels and other health-related aspects. Additional studies are required that provide greater attention to theoretical rationale, levels of implementation, and measures of physical activity within and outside the intervention.","A US meta-analysis of 11 after-school programs with an average contact time of 275 minutes per week showed a positive standardized mean difference effect size for physical activity (0.44; 95% CI, 0.28-0.60)."
"Do OTC remedies relieve cough in acute URIs
Zinc lozenges have been used for treatment of the common cold; however, the results remain controversial. Fifty ambulatory volunteers were recruited within 24 h of developing symptoms of the common cold for a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of zinc. Participants took 1 lozenge containing 13.3 mg of zinc (as zinc acetate) or placebo every 2-3 h while awake. The subjective scores for common cold symptoms were recorded daily. Plasma zinc, soluble interleukin (IL)-1 receptor antagonist (sIL-1ra), soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor 1, soluble vascular endothelial cell adhesion molecule, and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule (sICAM)-1 were assayed on days 1 and 5. Compared with the placebo group, the zinc group had a shorter mean overall duration of cold (4.0 vs. 7.1 days; P < .0001) and shorter durations of cough (2.1 vs. 5.0 days; P < .0001) and nasal discharge (3.0 vs. 4.5 days, P = .02) Blinding of subjects was adequate, and adverse effects were comparable in the 2 groups. Symptom severity scores were decreased significantly in the zinc group. Mean changes in plasma levels of zinc, sIL-1ra, and ICAM-1 differed significantly between groups. Administration of zinc lozenges was associated with reduced duration and severity of cold symptoms. We related the improvement in cold symptoms to the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of zinc.",Zinc lozenges containing 13.3 mg of zinc acetate taken every 2 to 3 hours decreased the duration of cough from 5.35 to 2.14 days (P<.001) in a double-blinded placebo-controlled randomized controlled trials of 50 adults.
"What are effective treatments for panic disorder
Panic disorder (PD) may be treated with drugs, psychosocial intervention, or both, but the relative and combined efficacies have not been evaluated in an unbiased fashion. To evaluate whether drug and psychosocial therapies for PD are each more effective than placebo, whether one treatment is more effective than the other, and whether combined therapy is more effective than either therapy alone. Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial conducted in 4 anxiety research clinics from May 1991 to April 1998. A total of 312 patients with PD were included in the analysis. Patients were randomly assigned to receive imipramine, up to 300 mg/d, only (n=83); cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) only (n=77); placebo only (n=24); CBT plus imipramine (n=65); or CBT plus placebo (n=63). Patients were treated weekly for 3 months (acute phase); responders were then seen monthly for 6 months (maintenance phase) and then followed up for 6 months after treatment discontinuation. Treatment response based on the Panic Disorder Severity Scale (PDSS) and the Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI) by treatment group. Both imipramine and CBT were significantly superior to placebo for the acute treatment phase as assessed by the PDSS (response rates for the intent-to-treat [ITT] analysis, 45.8%, 48.7%, and 21.7%; P=.05 and P=.03, respectively), but were not significantly different for the CGI (48. 2%, 53.9%, and 37.5%, respectively). After 6 months of maintenance, imipramine and CBT were significantly more effective than placebo for both the PDSS (response rates, 37.8%, 39.5%, and 13.0%, respectively; P=.02 for both) and the CGI (37.8%, 42.1%, and 13.0%, respectively). Among responders, imipramine produced a response of higher quality. The acute response rate for the combined treatment was 60.3% for the PDSS and 64.1% for the CGI; neither was significantly different from the other groups. The 6-month maintenance response rate for combined therapy was 57.1% for the PDSS (P=.04 vs CBT alone and P=.03 vs imipramine alone) and 56.3% for the CGI (P=.03 vs imipramine alone), but not significantly better than CBT plus placebo in either analysis. Six months after treatment discontinuation, in the ITT analysis CGI response rates were 41.0% for CBT plus placebo, 31.9% for CBT alone, 19.7% for imipramine alone, 13% for placebo, and 26.3% for CBT combined with imipramine. Combining imipramine and CBT appeared to confer limited advantage acutely but more substantial advantage by the end of maintenance. Each treatment worked well immediately following treatment and during maintenance; CBT appeared durable in follow-up. JAMA. 2000;283:2529-2536",cognitive-behavioral treatment and imipramine each reduce symptoms in 45%-48% of patients; combining them reduces symptoms in 60%. Imipramine is more effective initially; cognitive-behavioral treatment is more durable9 but effects may be therapist-dependent.
"Are major bleeding events from falls more likely in patients on warfarin
To determine whether the risk of falling (with a possible increased chance of subdural hematoma) should influence the choice of antithrombotic therapy in elderly patients with atrial fibrillation. A Markov decision analytic model was used to determine the preferred treatment strategy (no antithrombotic therapy, long-term aspirin use, or long-term warfarin use) for patients with atrial fibrillation who are 65 years of age and older, are at risk for falling, and have no other contraindications to antithrombotic therapy. Input data were obtained by systematic review of MEDLINE. Outcomes were expressed as quality-adjusted life-years. For patients with average risks of stroke and falling, warfarin therapy was associated with 12.90 quality-adjusted life-years per patient; aspirin therapy, 11.17 quality-adjusted life-years; and no antithrombotic therapy, 10.15 quality-adjusted life-years. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that, regardless of the patients' age or baseline risk of stroke, the risk of falling was not an important factor in determining their optimal antithrombotic therapy. For elderly patients with atrial fibrillation, the choice of optimal therapy to prevent stroke depends on many clinical factors, especially their baseline risk of stroke. However, patients' propensity to fall is not an important factor in this decision.","A study presented a Markov decision analysis (comparison of risk estimates in separate disease states) evaluating whether risk from falls should influence choice of anticoagulation therapy in elderly patients with atrial fibrillation. Risk of intracranial bleeding from falls was calculated from prospective cohort studies and retrospective case series from anticoagulation clinics, and stroke reduction benefit from anticoagulation was taken from a meta-analysis of 5 randomized controlled trials. Sensitivity analyses were performed to test the results of the decision analysis. The calculated risk of subdural hematoma from falling was such that a patient with a 5% annual stroke risk from atrial fibrillation would need to fall 295 times in a year for the fall risk to outweigh the stroke reduction benefit of warfarin."
"Does routine amniotomy have a role in normal labor
Intentional artificial rupture of the amniotic membranes during labour, sometimes called amniotomy or 'breaking of the waters', is one of the most commonly performed procedures in modern obstetric and midwifery practice. The primary aim of amniotomy is to speed up contractions and, therefore, shorten the length of labour. However, there are concerns regarding unintended adverse effects on the woman and baby. To determine the effectiveness and safety of amniotomy alone for (1) routinely shortening all labours that start spontaneously, and (2) shortening labours that have started spontaneously, but have become prolonged. We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 March 2007). Randomised controlled trials comparing amniotomy alone versus intention to preserve the membranes. We excluded quasi-randomised trials. Two authors assessed identified studies for inclusion. Both authors extracted data. Primary analysis was by intention to treat. We have included 14 studies in this review, involving 4893 women. There was no evidence of any statistical difference in length of first stage of labour (weighted mean difference -20.43 minutes, 95% confidence interval (CI) -95.93 to 55.06), maternal satisfaction with childbirth experience (standardised mean difference 0.27, 95% CI -0.49 to 1.04) or low Apgar score less than seven at five minutes (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.05). Amniotomy was associated with an increased risk of delivery by caesarean section compared to women in the control group, although the difference was not statistically significant (RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.62). There was no consistency between papers regarding the timing of amniotomy during labour in terms of cervical dilatation. On the basis of the findings of this review, we cannot recommend that amniotomy should be introduced routinely as part of standard labour management and care. We do recommend that the evidence presented in this review should be made available to women offered an amniotomy and may be useful as a foundation for discussion and any resulting decisions made between women and their caregivers.","A Cochrane review of 14 trials (4893 women) investigated the risks and benefits of routine amniotomy vs intention to leave membranes intact. All trials included only very-low-risk women in spontaneous labor at term with a singleton fetus in vertex presentation.Seven trials (1237 women) in the Cochrane review reported length of second-stage labor. No statistically significant difference was noted between amniotomy and control groups (WMD=-2.38 minutes; 95% CI, -5.27 to 0.50). However, subgroup analysis of primiparous women showed a statistically significant reduction in length of second-stage labor in the amniotomy group (WMD=-6.59 minutes; 95% CI, -12.34 to -0.84)."
"What test is the best for diagnosing infectious mononucleosis
Novel commercial kits based on antibody reactivity to purified heterophile antigens have recently been introduced for the diagnosis of Epstein-Barr (EB) virus-associated infectious mononucleosis (IM). It is important to determine possible improvements in the performance and reliability of such tests for the diagnosis of IM. To evaluate the reliability of six commercially available kits for the rapid diagnosis of IM in comparison to EB-virus-specific serology. In total, 100 sera, 53 from patients with serologically verified primary EB virus infection and 47 from EB-virus-immune or -susceptible patients, were used to evaluate the six rapid test kits: Monolatex, Mono-Latex, Mono-Lex (latex agglutination-based kits), Mono-Plus, IM-Check and Clearview IM (solid-phase-based kits). EB-virus-specific serologies including detection of viral capsid antigen IgM and IgG and EB nuclear antigen-1 IgG, were used as reference methods. Compared with the reference methods, the sensitivities and specificities of the heterophile antibody test kits were 70-92% and 96-100%, respectively. IM-Check had a low sensitivity and was difficult to read. The remaining kits performed well. Monolatex, Mono-Latex, Mono-Lex, Mono-Plus and Clearview IM can be recommended for the confirmation of EB-virus-associated infectious mononucleosis. Clearview IM combined a high sensitivity and specificity with very simple one-step solid-phase-based procedure.","A validating cohort study validating cohort studies assessed the accuracy of several commercially available test kits for the detection of heterophile antibodies (eg, ""Mono spot"" tests). The study compared 6 kits using either a latex agglutination or a solid-phase assay against a ""gold standard"" of serologic verification for 53 serum samples from primary epstein-barr virus infection, 26 samples from epstein-barr virus immune patients, and 21 samples from healthy donors. Serologic verification used immunoflourescence to determine: the absence of IgG but presence of IgM, the presence of IgG but absence of IgM, or the absence of both antibodies (respectively) against EBVCA."
"What medication best prevents migraine in children
An 8-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial was carried out on the use of nimodipine in migraine prophylaxis in 37 patients aged 7 to 18 years old. After a 4-week medication-free run-in period, 19 subjects (Group 1) received a placebo while 18 (Group 2) received nimodipine (10-20 mg t.i.d., according to body weight), for 12 weeks. After a 4-week wash-out period, the groups switched therapy for a further 12 weeks. 30 patients completed the trial and the number of dropouts was comparable in the 2 groups. The only side-effect during nimodipine treatment was mild abdominal discomfort (3 cases). The treatments were evaluated on the basis of frequency and duration of attacks. There was a significant reduction in both parameters during the first period of treatment. During the second period of treatment, nimodipine proved to have a significantly greater effect than the placebo with regard to frequency, whereas the response was similar with the placebo as regards duration of attacks. The latter parameter shows a significant decrease during the treatment periods, regardless of type of therapy.","Nimodipine, in a single randomized controlled trial with crossover design in 37 children decreased headache frequency from a mean of ~2.7 attacks/month to ~1.9 vs. no change for placebo (P<.05)."
"What interventions reduce the risk of contrast nephropathy for high-risk patients
To determine whether low-osmolality contrast media (LOCM) are less nephrotoxic than high-osmolality contrast media (HOCM), the authors searched MEDLINE and EMBASE databases and other sources to find randomized trials with data collected on changes in glomerular filtration rate or serum creatinine (SCr) level with LOCM and HOCM. Forty-five trials were found. Data were unavailable from 14 trials. When the P values from the other 31 trials were pooled, an overall P value of .02 was found. Among 24 trials with available data, the mean change in SCr was 0.2-6.2 mumol/L less with LOCM than HOCM. Among 25 trials with available data, the pooled odds of a rise in SCr level of more than 44 mumol/L with LOCM was 0.61 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.48-0.77) times that after HOCM. For patients with existing renal failure, this odds ratio was 0.5 (CI, 0.36-0.68), while it was 0.75 (CI, 0.52-1.1) in patients without prior renal failure. Greater changes in SCr level occurred only in those with existing renal failure and were less common with LOCM (odds ratio, 0.44; CI, 0.26-0.73). Use of LOCM may be beneficial in patients with existing renal failure.",Several studies have demonstrated decreased risk of contrast nephropathy for high-risk patients when low-osmolality contrast media are used rather than high-osmolality contrast media (NNT=27).
"How effective is gastric bypass for weight loss
To examine the effects of weight loss on health-related quality of life (HRQL) in subjects with severe obesity. Controlled clinical trial of the outcomes of surgical vs conventional weight reduction treatment. The first 487 surgical cases and their conventionally treated, matched controls were followed for two years in the Swedish Obese Subjects (SOS) intervention study. A battery of generic and study-specific self-assessment instruments or subscales was used to characterize HRQL in the severely obese (BMI) > or = 34 kg/m2 for males and BMI > or = 38 kg/m2 for females). Measures of general health perceptions (general health rating index; current health), mental well-being (mood adjective check list; pleasantness, activation and calmness), mood disorders (hospital anxiety and depression scale; anxiety and depression) and social interaction (sickness impact profile), were supplemented by obesity-specific modules on obesity-related psychosocial problems and eating behavior (three-factor eating questionnaire; restrained eating, disinhibition and perceived hunger). Assessments were conducted prior to treatment and repeated after 6, 12 and 24 months. Poor HRQL before intervention was dramatically improved after gastric restriction surgery, while only minor fluctuations in HRQL scores were observed in the conventionally treated controls. Peak values were observed in the surgical group at 6 or 12 months after intervention with a slight to moderate decrease at the two-year follow-up. The positive changes in HRQL after two years were related to the magnitude of weight loss, that is, the greater the weight reduction, the greater the HRQL improvements. Eating behavior improved accordingly. Quality of life in the severely obese is improved by substantial weight loss. Most patients benefit from weight reduction surgery, while HRQL in surgical patients with minor reduction in overweight is less positive. Further research is needed to determine outcome predictors of the surgical management of severe obesity and to ensure that HRQL improvements are maintained.",The Swedish Obesity Study found significant improvements in Health-Related Quality of Life scores at 2 years with surgery vs conventional treatment.
"What is the best treatment for mild to moderate acne
This multicenter, randomized, investigator-blinded study investigated the efficacy and tolerability of adapalene gel 0.1% plus clindamycin phosphate lotion 1%, compared with clindamycin plus vehicle for the treatment of mild to moderate acne vulgaris. A total of 249 patients applied clindamycin lotion twice daily and adapalene (125 patients) or vehicle gel (124 patients) once daily for 12 weeks. A significantly greater reduction of total (P <.001), inflammatory (P =.004) and noninflammatory lesions (P <.001) was seen in the clindamycin plus adapalene group than in the clindamycin plus vehicle group. These significant treatment effects were observed as early as week 4 for both noninflammatory and total lesion counts. Both treatment regimens were well tolerated. Although the worst scores for scaling (P <.05), dryness (P <.01), and stinging/burning (P <.05) were higher in the clindamycin plus adapalene group than in the clindamycin plus vehicle group in patients with moderate or severe irritation; in most cases these symptoms were of mild intensity.","Similarly, combination therapy with clindamycin and adapalene was superior to clindamycin alone in improving mild to moderate acne."
"Should patients receive 23-valent pneumococcal vaccination more than once
Revaccination of healthy adults with pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV) within several years of first vaccination has been associated with a higher than expected frequency and severity of local injection site reactions. The risk of adverse events associated with revaccination of elderly and chronically ill persons 5 or more years after first vaccination, as is currently recommended, has not been well defined. To determine whether revaccination with PPV at least 5 years after first vaccination is associated with more frequent or more serious adverse events than those following first vaccination. Comparative intervention study conducted between April 1996 and August 1997. Persons aged 50 to 74 years either who had never been vaccinated with PPV (n = 901) or who had been vaccinated once at least 5 years prior to enrollment (n = 513). PPV vaccination. Postvaccination local injection site reactions and prevaccination concentrations of type-specific antibodies. Those who were revaccinated were more likely than those who received their first vaccinations to report a local injection site reaction of at least 10.2 cm (4 in) in diameter within 2 days of vaccination: 11% (55/513) vs 3% (29/901) (relative risk [RR], 3.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.1-5.1). These reactions resolved by a median of 3 days following vaccination. The highest rate was among revaccinated patients who were immunocompetent and did not have chronic illness: 15% (33/228) compared with 3% (10/337) among comparable patients receiving their first vaccinations (RR, 4.9; 95% CI, 2.4-9.7). The risk of these local reactions was significantly correlated with prevaccination geometric mean antibody concentrations. Physicians and patients should be aware that self-limited local injection site reactions occur more frequently following revaccination compared with first vaccination; however, this risk does not represent a contraindication to revaccination with PPV for recommended groups.",Revaccination is safe; particularly when performed more than 5 years after the initial vaccination. Injection site reactions are more common and more severe in revaccinated persons (rising from 3% to 15% in the immunocompetent patient).
"How effective are hypertension self-care interventions
A randomised controlled trial was conducted to determine if physicians' advice to promote physical activity to patients was more effective if the advice was tailored to the management of hypertension, compared with more general health promotion advice. Participants included inactive 40- to 70-year-old patients visiting the physicians' during study recruitment period. Physicians provided verbal physical activity advice and written materials, both tailored to either general health promotion messages or specifically as a means for treating or managing hypertension. Seventy-five physicians and 98% (767/780) of screened eligible patients participated in the study. Differences between intervention and control groups self-reported physical activity were assessed over 6 months. Follow-up response rates were 92 and 84% at the 2- and 6-month assessments. There were no consistent, significant differences between groups at the 2- or 6-month assessments. Thus, neither intervention strategy resulted in significant changes in patients self-reported physical activity, regardless of the whether the advice was tailored to hypertension management or general health promotion advice.",We found 1 randomized trial that evaluated the effectiveness of a physician's advice to increase physical activity among patients with hypertension in a general practice setting. Physical activity was measured using a validated questionnaire. Patients given the advice as part of self-care for hypertension (n=192) were no more likely to have increased their physical activity than those not given the advice (n=108) at 2- and 6-month follow-ups.
"How effective are lifestyle changes for controlling hypertension
Evaluate whether weight-loss diets are more effective than regular diets or other antihypertensive therapies in controlling blood pressure and preventing morbidity and mortality in hypertensive adults. MEDLINE and The Cochrane Library were searched through November 1997. Trials known to experts in the field were included through June 1998. For inclusion in the review, trials were required to meet each of the following criteria: 1) randomized controlled trials with one group assigned to a weight-loss diet and the other group assigned to either normal diet or antihypertensive therapy; 2) ambulatory adults with a mean blood pressure of at least 140 mm Hg systolic and/or 90 mm Hg diastolic; 3) active intervention consisting of a calorie-restricted diet intended to produce weight loss (excluded studies simultaneously implementing multiple lifestyle interventions where the effects of weight loss could not be disaggregated); and 4) outcome measures included weight loss and blood pressure. Studies were dual abstracted by two independent reviewers using a standardized form designed specifically for this review. The primary mode of analysis was qualitative; graphs of effect sizes for individual studies were also used. Eighteen trials were found. Only one small study of inadequate power reported morbidity and mortality outcomes. None addressed quality of life or general well being issues. In general, participants assigned to weight-reduction groups lost weight compared to control groups. Six trials involving 361 participants assessed a weight-reducing diet versus a normal diet. The data suggested weight loss in the range of 4% to 8% of body weight was associated with a decrease in blood pressure in the range of 3 mm Hg systolic and diastolic. Three trials involving 363 participants assessed a weight-reducing diet versus treatment with antihypertensive medications. These suggested that a stepped-care approach with antihypertensive medications produced greater decreases in blood pressure (in the range of 6/5 mm Hg systolic/diastolic) than did a weight-loss diet. Trials that allowed adjustment of participants' antihypertensive regimens suggested that patients required less intensive antihypertensive drug therapy if they followed a weight-reducing diet. Data was insufficient to determine the relative efficacy of weight-reduction versus changes in sodium or potassium intake or exercise. Weight-reducing diets in overweight hypertensive persons can affect modest weight loss in the range of 3-9% of body weight and are probably associated with modest blood pressure decreases of roughly 3 mm Hg systolic and diastolic. Weight-reducing diets may decrease dosage requirements of persons taking antihypertensive medications.","A Cochrane review of 18 trials with 2611 participants concluded that for overweight hypertensive patients, weight loss of 3% to 9% of body weight is associated with 3 mm Hg decreases in both systolic blood pressure and DBP."
"How should we follow athletes after a concussion
Recent concussion management guidelines have suggested that athletes with mild (grade 1) concussions may be returned to play if asymptomatic for 15 minutes. The purpose of this study was to assess the utility of a current concussion management guideline in classifying and managing mild concussion. High school athletes diagnosed with a grade 1 concussion will demonstrate measurable decline in neuropsychological functioning that persists during the 1st week of recovery. Prospective study designed to evaluate neuropsychological functioning both prior to and following concussion. Forty-three high school athletes completed neuropsychological test performance and symptom ratings prior to the season and at two times during the 1st week following mild concussion. Thirty-six hours after injury, mildly concussed high school athletes demonstrated a decline in memory (P < 0.003) and a dramatic increase in self-reported symptoms (P < 0.00001) compared to baseline performance. Athletes with grade 1 concussion demonstrated memory deficits and symptoms that persisted beyond the context in which they were injured. These data suggest that current grade 1 return-to-play recommendations that allow for immediate return to play may be too liberal. Clinical Relevance: A reconsideration of current concussion grading systems appears to be warranted.","A prospective study of high-school athletes demonstrated that neuropsychological dysfunction takes a week or longer to resolve in ""ding"" concussions (defined as no loss of consciousness and overt symptoms resolved within 15 minutes)."
"Is there any benefit to Papanicolaou Pap test screening in women who have had a hysterectomy for benign disease
Using literature review, we assessed (1) Papanicolaou smear screening recommendations after hysterectomy for benign disease, (2) total hysterectomy for benign disease as a risk for vaginal dysplasia or carcinoma, and (3) effectiveness of screening for vaginal carcinoma after total hysterectomy for benign disease. We considered (1) organizations' recommendations about screening, (2) references from major textbooks of gynecology, and (3) MEDLINE searches of English-language studies published from 1966 through 1995 using the search strategy (hysterectomy and vaginal smears) or (vaginal smears and vaginal neoplasms). Published or verbal confirmations of screening recommendations were eligible. Criteria for assessing risk of vaginal dysplasia or carcinoma included original research, documented reports of hysterectomy as an exposure, and evidence of preinvasive vaginal disease or vaginal carcinoma outcomes. We sought data assessing burden of suffering, screening efficacy, and effectiveness of early detection. Descriptive and analytic data from each study were abstracted. Screening recommendations were categorized by the organizations' positions: two opposed screening, two supported screening, and six lacked specific guidelines. Data on the risk between total hysterectomy for benign disease and subsequent vaginal carcinoma were organized by study design (three case control, two cohort, and 13 case series) and described. Data on screening effectiveness were organized to address the criteria advocated by the US Preventive Services Task Force. There are conflicting guidelines on screening after hysterectomy and conflicting data on the risk of vaginal carcinoma after total hysterectomy for benign disease, though the best-designed research suggests no association. There is insufficient evidence to recommend routine vaginal smear screening in women after total hysterectomy for benign disease.",Fetters and colleagues estimated that the positive predictive value of an abnormal vaginal Pap test result was 0.05%; only 1 in 2000 women with abnormal test results would have cancer.
"What are the best treatments for herpes labialis
In a double-blind, randomized, patient-initiated clinical trial, 174 nonimmunocompromised patients with a history of virus-culture-confirmed herpes simplex labialis were treated with acyclovir capsules, 400 mg five times daily for 5 days, or placebo capsules. For 97% of the patients, treatment started within 1 h of the first sign or symptom of a recurrence. The frequency of positive lesion virus cultures was significantly lower among acyclovir-treated subjects (29/114, 25%) than among placebo-treated subjects (29/60, 48%; P = .004). Drug treatment did not affect the development of lesions, measured by the frequency of macular and papular (aborted) lesions and mean maximum lesion size. However, acyclovir hastened lesion resolution among the patients who could start treatment in the prodrome or erythema lesion stage. For this group, the mean duration of pain was reduced by 36% (P = .02) and the mean healing time to loss of crust by 27% (P = .03). Thus, oral acyclovir alleviated some of the clinical manifestations of herpes simplex labialis.","Oral acyclovir has also been shown to be effective in a well-done RCT. For a subgroup of patients who started acyclovir in the prodrome or erythema stage, the duration decreased (2.5 vs 3.9 days, P=.02), but in the papular stage, it did not decrease significantly (2.5 vs. 3.6 days, P=.36)."
"Is guaifenesin safe during pregnancy
Previous work has suggested that recall bias in case-control studies may be more serious when the overall study quality is lower. This paper summarizes a systematic literature search to examine the question. All relevant studies published between 1966 and 1990 were included if they met the following criteria: (1) they represented original work, (2) they used a human population, (3) they used a case-control design, (4) they had a ""validated"" gold standard applied equally to cases and controls and (5) they reported at least one of crude agreement rates, chance-corrected agreement rates (kappa), sensitivity or specificity. Sixteen such studies were identified. No relationship was found between the absolute differences in agreement between cases and controls and the overall level of agreement, in contradiction to suggestions in previous literature. Comparisons of the data quality for cases and controls using either the crude agreement level, kappa, sensitivity, or specificity gave linear relationships with correlations of 0.81, 0.78, 0.58 and 0.62 respectively. Kappas were generally lower than the corresponding crude agreement levels and specificities were higher than sensitivities. When used together, these types of comparisons can give valuable information regarding (1) the possible existence of differential recall in a particular study and (2) the quality of that study, A theoretical framework is proposed for use in these areas.","Because of the significant potential for recall bias, interpret the findings of these case-control studies with caution. The mother of a child with a birth defect may search her memory more aggressively for potential causes than a mother of a healthy infant, leading to different rates of recalled, rather than actual, exposures. In the absence of confirmatory prospective data, such as medication diaries or pharmacy databases, recall bias accounts for many spurious positive findings in case control studies."
"Do testosterone injections increase libido for elderly hypogonadal patients
While recent pharmacological advances have generated increased public interest and demand for clinical services regarding erectile dysfunction, epidemiologic data on sexual dysfunction are relatively scant for both women and men. To assess the prevalence and risk of experiencing sexual dysfunction across various social groups and examine the determinants and health consequences of these disorders. Analysis of data from the National Health and Social Life Survey, a probability sample study of sexual behavior in a demographically representative, 1992 cohort of US adults. A national probability sample of 1749 women and 1410 men aged 18 to 59 years at the time of the survey. Risk of experiencing sexual dysfunction as well as negative concomitant outcomes. Sexual dysfunction is more prevalent for women (43%) than men (31%) and is associated with various demographic characteristics, including age and educational attainment. Women of different racial groups demonstrate different patterns of sexual dysfunction. Differences among men are not as marked but generally consistent with women. Experience of sexual dysfunction is more likely among women and men with poor physical and emotional health. Moreover, sexual dysfunction is highly associated with negative experiences in sexual relationships and overall well-being. The results indicate that sexual dysfunction is an important public health concern, and emotional problems likely contribute to the experience of these problems.","Sexual dysfunction includes desire, arousal, orgasmic, and sex pain disorders. In the US, 43% of women and 31% of men experience sexual dysfunction. Since sexual dysfunction increases with age, the prevalence will likely increase with the aging American population."
"How should you document a patient's refusal to undergo a necessary intervention
Informed refusal is a fundamental component of the informed consent process. Informed consent laws have evolved to the ""materiality or patient viewpoint"" standard. A physician must disclose to the patient the risks, benefits, and alternatives that a reasonable person in the patient's position would want to know to make an informed decision. Throughout this process, the patient's autonomy, level of health literacy, and cultural background should be respected. The subsequent election by the patient to forgo an intervention that has been recommended by the physician constitutes informed refusal. Documentation of the informed refusal process is essential. It should include a notation that the need for the intervention, as well as risks, benefits, and alternatives to the intervention, and possible consequences of refusal, have been explained. The patient's reason for refusal also should be documented.","The general standard of disclosure has evolved to what an ordinary, reasonable patient would wish to know."
"How safe is vaginal birth after cesarean section for the mother and fetus
To evaluate neonatal outcomes after an elective repeat cesarean section (ERCS) compared with a trial of labor (TOL). All mothers who underwent previous cesarean section and delivered singleton infants at term gestation were identified during a 1-year period. Neonatal outcomes were compared between infants delivered by ERCS (n = 497) and those delivered by TOL (n = 492), and between infants delivered by a successful (n = 336) and a failed (n = 156) TOL. A cohort of mothers and their term infants delivered by routine vaginal delivery were also identified. Infants delivered by ERCS had an increased rate of transient tachypnea compared with infants born by TOL (6% vs 3%). Compared with routine vaginal deliveries, the adjusted odds ratio of developing any respiratory problem after an ERCS was 2.3 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.4, 3.8), and for developing transient tachypnea was 2.6 (CI: 1.5, 4.5). In addition, two infants delivered by ERCS developed respiratory distress syndrome. Infants delivered after a TOL had increased rates of suspected and proven sepsis (5% vs 2% and 1% vs 0.1%, respectively). Compared with a successful TOL, the infants delivered by cesarean section after a failed TOL had more neonatal morbidity and had a longer hospital stay (4.8 +/- 2 vs 3.1 +/- 2 days). The odds ratio for developing any respiratory illness after a failed TOL was 2.1 (95% CI: 1.1, 4.1), for suspected sepsis was 4.8 (95% CI: 2.6, 9.0), and for proven sepsis was 19.3 (95% CI: 2.0, 187). Neonatal outcomes after a successful TOL were similar to routine vaginal births. Infants born by ERCS are at increased risk for developing respiratory problems compared with those born by TOL. However, TOL is associated with increased rates of suspected and proven sepsis. This appears to be limited to infants delivered by cesarean section after a failed TOL.","The effect of vaginal birth after cesarean on neonatal morbidity and mortality is unclear. One retrospective cohort trial showed vaginal birth after cesarean was associated with an increase in neonatal sepsis (1% vs 0%; CI not given) compared with planned cesarean, but vaginal birth after cesarean resulted in less transient tachypnea (5% vs 7%) and hyper-bilirubinemia (2% vs 6%)."
"Should we screen for bacterial vaginosis in those at risk for preterm labor
To test the hypothesis that prophylactic administration of clindamycin 2% vaginal cream can reduce the incidence of preterm birth in a high risk population. A multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Twelve city hospitals in The Netherlands. One hundred and sixty-eight women with a singleton pregnancy and a history of a spontaneous preterm delivery in the preceding pregnancy. Clindamycin 2% vaginal cream, or placebo cream, administered daily for seven days at 26 and 32 weeks of gestation. Spontaneous preterm birth at < 37 weeks, admission for threatened preterm labour, neonatal infectious morbidity. In the intention-to-treat analysis no difference was found in overall preterm birth between clindamycin and placebo (23% vs 18%, respectively). In the subgroup who completed the trial and administered all medication, more women delivered before 34 weeks in the clindamycin group (1.4% in the placebo vs 9.0% in the clindamycin group; P < 0.05). The length of admissions for threatened preterm labour did not differ. More infectious neonatal morbidity was seen in the clindamycin group (5/83 vs 0/85; P < 0.05). Clindamycin 2% vaginal cream given prophylactically to women with a spontaneous preterm birth in the preceding pregnancy did not prevent preterm delivery or reduce the number of admissions for threatened preterm labour. The neonatal infectious morbidity in the group treated with clindamycin was significantly higher and a major concern. This multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial aimed to determine whether prophylactic administration of clindamycin 2% vaginal cream can reduce the incidence of preterm birth in a high risk population.  A total of 168 eligible women attending the antenatal clinics of 12 hospitals in Netherlands participated in the study.  Clindamycin 2% vaginal cream was administered to 83 women, and placebo cream to 85 women, daily for 7 days at 26 and 32 weeks of gestation.  Results of the study showed no difference in the overall preterm birth between clindamycin (23%) and placebo (18%) in the intention-to-treat analysis.  In the subgroup, which completed the trial and administered all medication, more women delivered before 34 weeks in the clindamycin group (9%) compared to the placebo group (1.4%).  Moreover, occurrence of neonatal infectious morbidity was higher in the clindamycin group (5/83 vs. 0/85; P  0.05).  In conclusion, clindamycin 2% vaginal cream given prophylactically to women with a spontaneous preterm birth in the preceding pregnancy did not prevent preterm delivery or reduce the number of admissions for threatened preterm labor.",A randomized trial of the prophylactic intravaginal clindamycin 2% cream to prevent preterm birth in high-risk women showed an increase in spontaneous preterm delivery in women who actually used all of the medication and did not have bacterial vaginosis (NNH=12.3; P<.05).
"What is the best test to detect herpes in skin lesions
Virus isolation in cell culture is the recognised diagnostic gold standard for genital herpes. Although increasing evidence indicates that polymerase chain reaction (PCR) provides a more rapid and sensitive diagnostic method, its implementation in routine diagnostic settings has been limited by concerns over contamination and cost. To evaluate the feasibility of replacing virus culture with PCR for the diagnosis of genital herpes in settings serving large populations of genitourinary medicine (GUM) attendees. Genital swabs collected from 233 consecutive GUM attendees with suspected genital herpes were tested in parallel by virus culture and automated real time PCR. Three specimen preparation methods were evaluated and the assay reliability was assessed by repeat testing, comparison with a commercially available assay, and herpes simplex virus (HSV) sequence analysis. Probe melting temperatures (Tm) were used to differentiate between HSV types without additional post-PCR steps. HSV was detected in 79/233 (34%) samples by virus culture and 132/233 (57%) samples by PCR. PCR significantly increased HSV detection in both early (< 5 days) and late (> or = 5 days) presentations and in both first and recurrent episodes. HSV detection and typing by PCR was achieved within less than 4 hours leading to a significant reduction in labour compared to virus culture. Most specimens (120/132, 91%) were typed as HSV-2. Results were highly reproducible. Real time PCR is a highly reproducible, rapid, and labour efficient method for HSV detection in genital swabs. Its implementation is feasible in routine diagnostic settings.","In London, 233 samples from patients at a genitourinary medicine clinic were tested with both viral culture and PCR. herpes simplex virus was detected in 79 samples by culture and 132 samples by PCR. The detection by PCR was higher in early as well as late stages of infection and in both first and recurrent episodes. The reference standard for these studies was not an independent standard, but a positive result on both tests or modified versions of the PCR test. The use of a version of the test of interest (PCR) as part of the reference standard, while probably unavoidable in this situation, will tend inflate the sensitivity and specificity."
"What is the appropriate diagnostic evaluation of fibroids
To establish the accuracy of saline infusion hysterosonography in diagnosing uterine pathology when compared with outpatient hysteroscopy. Prospective, parallel, blinded comparative study. Outpatient hysteroscopy clinic in a large university teaching hospital. All women referred for outpatient hysteroscopy in a 15-month period. Women underwent saline infusion hysterosonography followed by flexible hysteroscopy. The ultrasonographer was blinded to the hysteroscopy result and the gynaecologist was blinded to the saline infusion hysterosonography result. The relative success rates and pain scores for each procedure. The validity of saline infusion hysterosonography as a diagnostic test. One hundred and seventeen women entered the study; 70 women were premenopausal and 47 postmenopausal. In 27 women, one or both procedures could not be performed. Saline infusion hysterosonography failed in 20 women, on one occasion hysteroscopy failed and both investigations failed in six women. Ninety cases remained for direct comparison, with 78 cases of agreement on the uterine findings in both investigations. Twelve cases disagreed; in one case, an adhesion was seen, two cases with polyps and five with fibroids seen on ultrasound but not seen on hysteroscopy. There were four cases where polyps were identified on hysteroscopy but not on saline infusion hysterosonography. The median pain scores were 1.6 for saline infusion hysterosonography and 3.2 for hysteroscopy. Both saline infusion hysterosonography and hysteroscopy are well tolerated by women. Saline infusion hysterosonography has a high failure rate but has a lower pain score than hysteroscopy.","A prospective, blinded comparative study of sonohysterography and hysteroscopy for diagnosing fibroids in 117 women found sonohysterography to have a higher failure rate (22% vs 6%) but a statistically significant lower median pain score: 1.6 (interquartile range 0.48-3.03) vs 3.2 (1.58-5.18) (P<.001)-than hysteroscopy. Failure of sonohysterography was most commonly due to cervical stenosis."
"What levels of cholesterol should be treated for primary prevention
Lowering the blood cholesterol level may reduce the risk of coronary heart disease. This double-blind study was designed to determine whether the administration of pravastatin to men with hypercholesterolemia and no history of myocardial infarction reduced the combined incidence of nonfatal myocardial infarction and death from coronary heart disease. We randomly assigned 6595 men, 45 to 64 years of age, with a mean (+/- SD) plasma cholesterol level of 272 +/- 23 mg per deciliter (7.0 +/- 0.6 mmol per liter) to receive pravastatin (40 mg each evening) or placebo. The average follow-up period was 4.9 years. Medical records, electrocardiographic recordings, and the national death registry were used to determine the clinical end points. Pravastatin lowered plasma cholesterol levels by 20 percent and low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol levels by 26 percent, whereas there was no change with placebo. There were 248 definite coronary events (specified as nonfatal myocardial infarction or death from coronary heart disease) in the placebo group, and 174 in the pravastatin group (relative reduction in risk with pravastatin, 31 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 17 to 43 percent; P < 0.001). There were similar reductions in the risk of definite nonfatal myocardial infarctions (31 percent reduction, P < 0.001), death from coronary heart disease (definite cases alone: 28 percent reduction, P = 0.13; definite plus suspected cases: 33 percent reduction, P = 0.042), and death from all cardiovascular causes (32 percent reduction, P = 0.033). There was no excess of deaths from noncardiovascular causes in the pravastatin group. We observed a 22 percent reduction in the risk of death from any cause in the pravastatin group (95 percent confidence interval, 0 to 40 percent; P = 0.051). Treatment with pravastatin significantly reduced the incidence of myocardial infarction and death from cardiovascular causes without adversely affecting the risk of death from noncardiovascular causes in men with moderate hypercholesterolemia and no history of myocardial infarction.","Statins are the most effective at reducing LDL-C and the associated cardiovascular risk. The 5-year West of Scotland study (WOSCOPS) showed that a 26% reduction in LDL-C (from a mean of 192 to 142 mg/dL) using pravastatin 40 mg per day reduced the risk of either nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) or coronary heart disease (CHD) death (number needed to treat [NNT] = 42; relative risk [RR] = 31; 95% confidence interval [CI],17 - 43). This trial enrolled middle-aged men with an LDL-C level > 155 mg/dL without a history of prior MI, although subjects with stable angina (5% of the participants) were still eligible. Similar reductions were seen in cardiovascular death and in all-cause death (RR = 22; 95% CI = 0 - 40)."
"What is the most beneficial diet for patients with diverticulosis
To compare the efficacy and tolerance of lactulose (Duphalac) and high-fibre diet in the treatment of symptomatic diverticular disease. Prospectively randomised, parallel groups study over 12 weeks. Patients were seen by their clinician for an initial assessment and then at weeks 4, 8 and 12. Hospital out-patients in the United Kingdom. Forty-three patients with a confirmed diagnosis of diverticular disease were entered into the study. Patients were prospectively randomised to receive lactulose (15 ml bd) or high-fibre diet (30-40 g daily) for 12 weeks. Data were collected using diary cards and physicians' assessments. Bowel frequency and stool consistency improved similarly with both treatments. Pain on bowel movement improved with both treatments in respect of frequency (lactulose: P = 0.017, fibre: P = 0.084) and severity (lactulose: P = 0.028, fibre: P = 0.043). Abdominal pain also improved with both treatments in respect of frequency (lactulose: P = 0.0015, fibre: P = 0.022) and severity (lactulose: P = 0.009, fibre: P = 0.028). Nine patients on lactulose and 12 on fibre reported treatment-emergent symptoms, of which none was serious. Lactulose and high-fibre diet were both shown to be effective in the treatment of diverticular disease, with some differences in favour of lactulose.",A small randomized trial of lactulose vs dietary fiber showed both treatments to be effective in alleviating symptoms of diverticular disease.
"What are the indications for evaluating a patient with cough for pertussis
To describe the clinical course of fatal cases of pertussis and identify predictors of death at the time of presentation for medical care. Case-control study of 16 deaths from pertussis identified by the Immunization Monitoring Program, Active (IMPACT) surveillance network (January 1991-December 2001) matched with 32 nonfatal cases by age, date, and geography. Differences were compared by Fisher exact test and logistic regression. A multivariate model was developed using stepwise logistic regression. All 16 fatal cases were < or =6 months old; 13 were <2 months old. Fatal cases were less likely to have had cough complications during pregnancy (48% vs 14%; P=.046) and more likely to have pneumonia (63% vs 16%; P=.0024) before hospital admission and more likely to have seizures, pneumonia, leukocytosis, and hypoxemia after admission (P<.001 for all comparisons). White blood cell count and pneumonia were independent predictors of fatal outcome in the multivariate model. Infants too young to have begun their immunizations are at highest risk of fatal pertussis infection. Leukocytosis and pneumonia are predictors of a poor outcome; however, rapid progression of the disease may make interventions difficult.","Pertussis should be considered early in the evaluation of young infants with cough. In a case-control study comparing 15 fatal cases of pertussis with 32 who survived (infants aged <6 months), the mean number of days from symptom onset to hospital admission were 5.3 (fatal) and 8.6 (survivors). Rates of apnea on admission were 40% and 52%."
"When should a child with an undescended testis be referred to a urologist
Early diagnosis and management of the undescended testicle are needed to preserve fertility and improve early detection of testicular malignancy. Physical examination of the testicle can be difficult; consultation should be considered if a normal testis cannot be definitely identified. Observation is not recommended beyond one year of age because it delays treatment, lowers the rate of surgical success and probably impairs spermatogenesis. By six months of age, patients with undescended testicles should be evaluated by a pediatric urologist or other qualified subspecialist who can assist with diagnosis and treatment. Earlier referral may be warranted for bilateral nonpalpable testes in the newborn or for any child with both hypospadias and an undescended testis. Therapy for an undescended testicle should begin between six months and two years of age and may consist of hormone or surgical treatment. The success of either form of treatment depends on the position of the testicle at diagnosis. Recent improvements in surgical technique, including laparoscopic approaches to diagnosis and treatment, hold the promise of improved outcomes. While orchiopexy may not protect patients from developing testicular malignancy, the procedure allows for earlier detection through self-examination of the testicles.",The benefits of orchiopexy for testicular cancer are also unclear; expert opinion suggests that orchiopexy may allow earlier detection of testicular tumors.
"What is the best treatment for diabetic neuropathy
To determine the relative efficacy and adverse effects of antidepressants and anticonvulsants in the treatment of diabetic neuroapathy and postherpetic neuralgia, published reports were identified from a variety of electronic databases, including Medline, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library and the Oxford Pain Relief Database, and from two previously published reviews. Additional studies were identified from the reference lists of retrieved reports. The relative benefit (RB) and number-needed-to-treat (NNT) for one patient to achieve at least 50 % pain relief was calculated from available dichotomous data, as was the relative risk (RR) and number-needed-to-harm (NH) for minor adverse effects and drug related study withdrawal. In diabetic neuropathy, 16 reports compared antidepressants with placebo (491 patient episodes) and three compared anticonvulsants with placebo (321). The NNT for at least 50 % pain relief with antidepressants was 3.4 (95 % confidence interval 2.6-4. 7) and with anticonvulsants 2. 7 (2. 2-3. 8). In postherpetic neuralgia, three reports compared antidepressants with placebo (145 patient episodes) and one compared anticonvulsants with placebo (225), giving an NNT with antidepressants of 2.1 (1. 7-3) and with anticonvulsants 3.2 (2.4-5). There was little difference in the incidence of minor adverse effects with either antidepressants or anticonvulsants compared with placebo, with 1VH (minor) values of about 3. For drug-related study withdrawal, antidepressants had an NNH (major) of 17 (11-43) compared with placebo, whereas with anticonvulsants there was no significant difference from placebo. Antidepressants and anticonvulsants had the same efficacy and incidence of minor adverse effects in these tzoo neuropathic pain conditions. There was no evidence that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) were better than older antidepressants, and no evidence that gabapentin was better than older anticonvulsants. In these trials patients were more likely to stop taking antidepressants than anticonvulsants because of adverse effects.",Limited evidence suggests that SSRIs are no more efficacious than placebo.
"When should you suspect community-acquired MRSA? How should you treat it
Empirical use of beta-lactam antibiotics, the preferred agents for treating uncomplicated skin and soft tissue infections, may no longer be appropriate for these infections because of the increasing prevalence of community strains of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Retrospective studies, however, suggest that outcomes are good even when beta-lactams are used. We conducted a randomized, double-blind trial of 166 outpatient subjects comparing placebo to cephalexin at 500 mg orally four times for 7 days after incision and drainage of skin and soft tissue abscesses. The primary outcome was clinical cure or failure 7 days after incision and drainage. S. aureus was isolated from 70.4% of abscess cultures. Of the isolates tested 87.8% were MRSA, 93% of which were positive for Panton-Valentine leucocidin genes. Clinical cure rates were 90.5% (95% confidence interval, 0.82 to 0.96) in the 84 placebo recipients and 84.1% (95% confidence interval, 0.74 to 0.91) in the 82 cephalexin recipients (difference in the two proportions, 0.0006; 95% confidence interval, -0.0461 to 0.0472; P = 0.25). The 90.5% cure rate observed in the placebo arm and 84.1% cure rate observed in the cephalexin arm provide strong evidence that antibiotics may be unnecessary after surgical drainage of uncomplicated skin and soft tissue abscesses caused by community strains of MRSA.","A 2007 randomized controlled trials of 166 indigent, inner-city patients with confirmed MRSA investigated combining incision and drainage with 7 days of therapy using either cephalexin or placebo. The primary outcome was clinical cure or failure 7 days after incision and drainage. The trial found no advantage to adding antibiotics; MRSA would likely be resistant to cephalexin in any case."
"Which tests are the most useful for diagnosing pelvic inflammatory disease
To evaluate the diagnostic test characteristics of common tests used to diagnose upper genital tract infection. Subjects included women who either met the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's minimal criteria for acute pelvic inflammatory disease or who had other signs of upper genital tract infection (i.e., atypical pelvic pain, abnormal uterine bleeding, or cervicitis). The subjects were evaluated with a baseline interview, comprehensive laboratory testing, and either an endometrial biopsy or laparoscopy for definitive diagnosis of upper genital tract infection. Patients were considered positive for upper genital tract infection if they had any of the following findings: 1) histologic evidence of acute endometriosis or salpingitis, 2) laparoscopic visualization of purulent exudate in the pelvis without another source, or 3) positive testing for Neisseria gonorrhoeae or Chlamydia trachomatis from the endometrium, fallopian tubes, or pelvis. One hundred twenty women with adequate endometrial samples were evaluated between August 1993 and September 1995. The median age of the study population was 24 years: 38% were white, 52% were smokers, 81% were insured by Medicaid or were uninsured, and 67% were single. Sensitivities for elevated white blood cell count (WBC), erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and increased vaginal white blood cells are 57, 70, 71, and 78%, respectively. If any one test is abnormal, the sensitivity is 100% and specificity is 18%. If all four tests are abnormal, sensitivity is 29% and specificity is 95%. Testing for increased vaginal white blood cells was found to be the most sensitive laboratory indicator for upper genital tract infection, whereas serum WBC was the most specific. No one diagnostic laboratory test is pathognomonic for upper genital tract infection. Combinations of positive tests can improve diagnostic specificity and positive predictive value, but with a diminution of sensitivity and negative predictive value. Combinations of negative tests can reliably exclude upper genital tract infection.","A study developed a model using vaginal white blood cells (the single most sensitive factor at 78%), serum white blood cells (the single most specific factor at 88%), CRP, and ESR. The model was 100% sensitive if the diagnosis only required 1 positive test, although the specificity was only 18%. The positive predictive value was 65%. If all 4 were positive, specificity was 95%, with 29% sensitivity, a positive predictive value of 90%, and a negative predictive value of 47%. Prevalence was 60% in the group studied."
"What treatments work best for constipation in children
Faecal incontinence is a common and potentially distressing disorder of childhood. To assess the effects of behavioural and/or cognitive interventions for the management of faecal incontinence in children. We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Trials Register (searched 1 February 2006). Randomised and quasi-randomised trials of behavioural and/or cognitive interventions with or without other treatments for the management of faecal incontinence in children. Reviewers selected studies from the literature, assessed study quality, and extracted data. Data were combined in a meta-analysis when appropriate. Eighteen randomised trials with a total of 1168 children met the inclusion criteria. Sample sizes were generally small. All studies but one investigated children with functional faecal incontinence. Interventions varied amongst trials and few outcomes were shared by trials addressing the same comparisons. Combined results of nine trials showed higher rather than lower rates of persisting symptoms of faecal incontinence up to 12 months when biofeedback was added to conventional treatment (OR 1.11 CI 95% 0.78 to 1.58). This result was consistent with that of two trials with longer follow-up (OR 1.31 CI 95% 0.80 to 2.15). In one trial the adjunct of anorectal manometry to conventional treatment did not result in higher success rates in chronically constipated children (OR 1.40 95% CI 0.72 to 2.73 at 24 months). In one small trial the adjunct of behaviour modification to laxative therapy was associated with a significant reduction in children's soiling episodes at both the three month (OR 0.14 CI 95% 0.04 to 0.51) and the 12 month assessment (OR 0.20 CI 95% 0.06 to 0.65). There is no evidence that biofeedback training adds any benefit to conventional treatment in the management of functional faecal incontinence in children. There was not enough evidence on which to assess the effects of biofeedback for the management of organic faecal incontinence. There is some evidence that behavioural interventions plus laxative therapy, rather than laxative therapy alone, improves continence in children with functional faecal incontinence associated with constipation.","A Cochrane systematic review of 9 small, poor-quality RCTs in children with functional fecal incontinence found no significant improvement when biofeedback was added to conventional treatment for as long as 12 months (odds ratio=1.11; 95% confidence interval, 0.78-1.58).9 In 1 small trial, however, adding behavior modification to laxative therapy significantly reduced soiling episodes."
"How effective is desmopressin for primary nocturnal enuresis
Enuresis (bedwetting) is a socially disruptive and stressful condition which affects around 15-20% of five year olds, and up to 2% of young adults. To assess the effects of desmopressin on nocturnal enuresis in children, and to compare desmopressin with other interventions. We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group trials register. Date of the most recent search: March 2002. The reference list of a previous version of this review was also searched. All randomised trials of desmopressin for nocturnal enuresis in children were included in the review. Comparison interventions included placebo, other drugs, alarms or behavioural methods. Trials focused solely on daytime wetting were excluded. Two reviewers independently assessed the quality of the eligible trials, and extracted data. Forty one randomised trials involving 2760 children (of whom 1813 received desmopressin) met the inclusion criteria. The quality of many of the trials was poor. Desmopressin was compared with another drug in four trials, and with alarms in seven. Desmopressin was effective in reducing bedwetting in a variety of doses and forms. Each dose of desmopressin reduced bedwetting by at least one night per week during treatment compared with placebo (e.g. 20 microg: 1.34 fewer wet nights per week, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.57). Children on desmopressin were more likely to become dry (e.g. RR for failure to achieve 14 dry nights with 20 mcg 0.84, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.91). However, there was no difference after treatment was finished. There was no clear dose-related effect of desmopressin, but the evidence was limited. Data which compared oral and nasal administration were too few to be conclusive. While desmopressin was better than diclofenac or indomethacin, and comparison with tricyclic drugs (amitriptyline and imipramine) suggested that they might be as effective as desmopressin, the data were inconclusive due to small numbers. There were more side effects with the tricyclics. In one small trial, desmopressin resulted in more wet nights than alarms towards the end of treatment (WMD 1.4, 95% CI: 0.14 to 2.66) and the chance of failure or relapse after alarms was less (RR 9.17, 95% CI 1.28 to 65.90). Although there were fewer wet nights during alarm treatment supplemented by desmopressin compared with alarms alone (WMD -1.35, 95% CI -2.32 to -0.38), the data are inconclusive about whether this is reflected in lower failure (RR 0.88, 95%CI 0.52 to 1.50) or subsequent relapse rates (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.10). Desmopressin rapidly reduced the number of wet nights per week, but there was some evidence that this was not sustained after treatment stopped. Comparison with alternative treatments suggested that desmopressin and tricyclics had similar clinical effects, but that alarms may produce more sustained benefits. However, based on the available limited evidence, these conclusions can only be tentative. Children should be advised not to drink more than 240 ml (8 oz) fluid during desmopressin treatment in order to avoid the possible risk of water intoxication.",Data were insufficient to judge the effectiveness of the oral versus nasal route of desmopressin.
"Menstrual disturbances in perimenopausal women: What's best
Heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) is an important cause of ill health in women and it accounts for 12% of all gynaecology referrals in the UK. Heavy menstrual bleeding is clinically defined as greater than or equal to 80 ml of blood loss per menstrual cycle. However, women may complain of excessive bleeding when their blood loss is less than 80 ml. Hysterectomy is often used to treat women with this complaint but medical therapy may be a successful alternative. The intrauterine coil device was originally developed as a contraceptive but the addition of uterine relaxing hormones, progestogens, to these devices resulted in a large reduction in menstrual blood loss. Case studies of two types of progesterone or progestogen-releasing systems, Progestasert and Mirena, reported reductions of up to 90% and that dysmenorrhoea may be improved. Insertion, however, may be regarded as invasive by some women, which affects its acceptability as a treatment. Frequent intermenstrual bleeding and spotting is also likely during the first few months. To determine the effectiveness and acceptability of progesterone or progestogen-releasing intrauterine devices in achieving a reduction in heavy menstrual bleeding. All studies which might describe randomised controlled trials of progesterone or progestagen-releasing intrauterine devices for the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding were obtained by electronic searches of The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (1966 to 2005) and EMBASE (1980 to 2005). Companies producing progestogen-releasing intrauterine devices and experts in the field were contacted for information on published and unpublished trials. Randomised controlled trials in women of reproductive age treated with progesterone or progestogen-releasing intrauterine devices versus no treatment, placebo, or other medical or surgical therapy for heavy menstrual bleeding within primary care, family planning or specialist clinic settings were eligible for inclusion. Women with postmenopausal bleeding, intermenstrual or irregular bleeding, or pathological causes of heavy menstrual bleeding were excluded. Potential trials were independently assessed by three review authors and nine trials met the criteria for inclusion in the review. The reviewers extracted the data independently and data were pooled where appropriate. Odds ratios (OR) were estimated from the data for dichotomous outcomes and weighted mean differences (WMD) for continuous outcomes. The primary outcome was reduction in menstrual blood loss but incidence of side effects, changes in quality of life, satisfaction and acceptability measures were also assessed. Progesterone or progestogen-releasing intrauterine systems have not been compared to placebo or no treatment. Progestasert has been compared to a number of different medical therapies in one small study but no conclusions can be made about its effectiveness. The levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device (LNG IUS) has been compared to oral cyclical norethisterone (NET) administered on days 5 to 26 of the menstrual cycle in one trial and was significantly more effective although there was a large reduction in loss from baseline in both groups. Some short term side effects were more common in the LNG IUS group but a significantly greater proportion of women in this group were satisfied and willing to continue with their treatment. In one trial of women awaiting hysterectomy, where the LNG IUS was compared with a control group taking their existing medical therapy, a higher proportion of the women in the intrauterine device group cancelled their planned surgery after six months of treatment. The LNG IUS has been compared to an endometrial ablation: either transcervical resection of the endometrium (TCRE) (two trials) or balloon ablation (three trials). There was a significantly greater mean reduction in menstrual bleeding in one trial in those undergoing balloon ablation (WMD -45.2 units, 95% CI -56.9 to -33.5), a lower score on the pictorial blood loss chart (PBAC) (WMD 33.2 units, 95% CI 27.2 to 39.2) and higher rates of successful treatment in 3 trials including both balloon and TCRE (OR 0.28, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.58) but the rates of satisfaction with treatment was were similar. There was no conclusive evidence of changes in quality of life between groups but women with the LNG IUS had a greater incidence of progestogenic side effects within one year. The LNG IUS has been compared to hysterectomy in one trial. There was no evidence of a change in quality of life scores but the LNG IUS treatment had lower costs than with hysterectomy, both at one and five-years follow up. The levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device (LNG IUS) is more effective than cyclical norethisterone (for 21 days) as a treatment for heavy menstrual bleeding. Women with an LNG IUS are more satisfied and willing to continue with treatment but experience more side effects, such as intermenstrual bleeding and breast tenderness. The LNG IUS results in a smaller mean reduction in menstrual blood loss (as assessed by the PBAC chart) than endometrial ablation but there is no evidence of a difference in the rate of satisfaction with treatment. Women with an LNG IUS experience more progestogenic side effects compared to women having TCRE for treatment of their heavy menstrual bleeding but there is no evidence of a difference in their perceived quality of life. The LNG IUS treatment costs less than hysterectomy but there is no evidence of a difference in quality of life measures between these groups. There are no data available from randomised controlled trials comparing progesterone-releasing intrauterine systems to either placebo or other commonly used medical therapies for heavy menstrual bleeding.","A Cochrane review found that progestogen-releasing IUDs significantly reduce heavy menstrual bleeding and are more effective than cyclical norethisterone (21 days). Patients did, however, report greater progestogenic side effects (breast tenderness and intermenstrual bleeding) than cyclical therapy. One unblinded randomized controlled trials that randomized women scheduled for hysterectomy for heavy bleeding to the levonorgestrel intrauterine device (LNG-IUD) or their existing medical therapy (not further described) found that women in the LNG-IUD group were more likely to cancel surgery. Another randomized controlled trials comparing hysterectomy with the LNG-IUD found that women with the LNG-IUD reported greater pain. The LNG-IUD was more cost effective at 1 and 5 years, primarily because of reduced surgical expenses. Some patients or physicians may have ethical issues with the device's mechanism of action."
"What is the appropriate use of sunscreen for infants and children
Undercompliance with sunscreen reapplication recommendations is a probable factor in suboptimal childhood ultraviolet radiation (UVR) protection. However, improving on the ability of sunscreens to absorb UVR without requiring frequent reapplication is difficult because the models most frequently used to develop and evaluate photoprotectants have only a limited ability to incorporate behavioral and environmental variables that are primarily responsible for loss of sunscreen efficacy. Hence, the objective of the present work was to develop a method to evaluate the efficacy of various regimens of sunscreen reapplication in children, under conditions of unrestricted behavior and exposure to ambient sunlight. Ninety-eight children, ages 7-12, Fitzpatrick skin types I-III, were divided between two study groups. The majority were types I-II, and all types were approximately equally represented between the groups. The children received single or multiple applications of a sun protection factor 25 sunscreen to preassigned lateral halves of the body and engaged in unrestricted activities throughout a 6- (group I) or 8-h (group II) period of sun exposure at a seaside location. The end measurement for these studies was incidence and severity of erythema 18 to 22 h after peak UV exposure. The results obtained showed that 1 or 4 sunscreen applications yielded comparable erythema protection after a 6-hour sun exposure, totaling 13 minimal erythema doses (MED). However, after an 8-h, 21 MED exposure, incidence and severity of erythema was greater at body sites treated with 1 compared with 5 sunscreen applications.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","A paired, split-body study of children receiving supervised single vs multiple applications of SPF-25 sunscreen to randomly assigned lateral halves of their bodies found protection to be equal for 6 hours of direct sunlight exposure. When the study was repeated with 8 hours of exposure, half the children developed mild erythema on the side with 1 application."
"Should you use steroids to treat infectious mononucleosis
To evaluate the efficacy of a single oral dose of dexamethasone for pain relief in acute exudative pharyngitis associated with infectious mononucleosis. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pediatric emergency department-based clinical trial. Patients aged between 8 and 18 years with a sore throat from clinically suspected infectious mononucleosis were eligible. Patients were randomized to receive either an oral dose of 0.3 mg/kg (maximum, 15 mg) of dexamethasone or a placebo. Patients completed a diary of symptoms and rated their pain on a visual analog scale from 0 to 100 mm at 0 hours, 12 hours, 24 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours, and on day 7. An improvement of 20 mm from baseline on the visual analog scale was evaluated as the primary end point. Twenty patients were recruited in each group; mean +/- SD age was 13.5 +/- 2.8 years. In comparison with the placebo group, a significantly greater proportion of patients given dexamethasone achieved pain relief within the first 12 hours (12/20 vs 5/19; P =.03). On further follow-up, the proportions achieving pain relief were similar between groups: 11 of 20 vs 6 of 20 at 24 hours (P =.10); 11 of 20 vs 11 of 20 at 48 hours (P>.99); 15 of 20 vs 15 of 19 at 72 hours (P =.93); and 18 of 19 vs 19 of 20 at day 7 (P>.99), with dexamethasone vs placebo, respectively. The short-lived relief of pain in acute exudative pharyngitis in children with suspected infectious mononucleosis may suggest that a single oral dose of dexamethasone may not be sufficient and that additional doses may be necessary for ensuring lasting relief.","In an randomized controlled trials of 40 patients, 1 dose of dexamethasone reduced throat pain at 12 hours in 60% of the treatment group, compared with placebo. However, no significant differences were noted at 1 and 7 days."
"Can you differentiate bacterial from viral pediatric infections based on the CBC
We assess the utility of the peripheral blood WBC count as a screen for lumbar puncture among young infants evaluated for serious bacterial infections. We performed logistic regression modeling and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis of peripheral blood WBC count and cerebrospinal fluid WBC count for results obtained from 3- to 89-day-old infants undergoing a full sepsis evaluation. Twenty-two of 5,353 (4.1 per 1,000) infants had acute bacterial meningitis. For diagnosing acute bacterial meningitis, the peripheral blood WBC count was poorly discriminating and significantly inferior to the cerebrospinal fluid WBC count. This was true both when the odds of meningitis were modeled to vary linearly and as a U-shaped function of the peripheral blood WBC count. When relying on single and interval-based high-risk thresholds of peripheral blood WBC counts alone, the majority of infants with acute bacterial meningitis would have been missed. Decisions to perform or withhold lumbar puncture should not be based on prevailing interpretations of the total peripheral blood WBC counts to maximize detection of bacterial meningitis in young infants.",A retrospective study of 5353 infants ages 3 to 89 days presenting to the emergency department for evaluation of fever showed that 3 of 4 infants ultimately diagnosed with bacterial meningitis would have been missed if the white blood cells count alone were used to predict which infants need a lumbar puncture.
"Are inhalers with spacers better than nebulizers for children with asthma
In acute asthma inhaled beta-agonists are often administered to relieve bronchospasm by wet nebulisation, but some have argued that metered-dose inhalers with a holding chamber (spacer) can be equally effective. In the community setting nebulisers are more expensive, require a power source and need regular maintenance. There is controversy as to whether wet nebulisers are better than metered dose inhalers with holding chambers to deliver beta2-agonist medications for acute asthma. Comparisons of hospital and home use are also of interest. The objective of this review was to assess the effects of holding chambers compared to nebulisers for the delivery of beta2-agonists for acute asthma. We searched the Cochrane Airways Group trials register and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register. Randomised trials in adults and children (from two years of age) with asthma, where holding chamber beta2-agonist delivery was compared with wet nebulisation. Two reviewers independently applied study inclusion criteria (one reviewer for the first version of the review), extracted the data and assessed trial quality. Missing data were obtained from the authors or estimated. This review has been updated in 2001 to include 4 new trials and has now analysed 880 children and 444 adults included in 21 trials. Method of delivery of beta2-agonist did not appear to affect hospital admission rates. In adults, the relative risk of admission for holding chamber versus nebuliser was 0.88 (95% confidence interval 0.56 to 1.38). The relative risk for children was 0.65 (95% confidence interval 0.4 to 1.06). One study in children found a significantly shorter length of stay in the emergency department when the holding chamber was used, with a weighted mean difference of -0.62 hours, 95% confidence interval -0.84 to -0.40 hours. Adults' length of stay in the emergency department was similar for the two delivery methods. Peak flow and forced expiratory volume were also similar for the two delivery methods. Pulse rate was lower for holding chamber in children, weighted mean difference -7.8% baseline (95% confidence interval -10.2 to -5.3). Metered-dose inhalers with holding chamber produced outcomes that were at least equivalent to nebuliser delivery. Holding chambers may have some advantages compared to nebulisers for children with acute asthma.","A Cochrane review of 10 randomized controlled trials comparing nebulizers with MDI/S, both in adults and in children aged >2 years, showed a substantial trend towards improvement in hospital admission rates with metered dose inhaler spacer use. Sample size for each study was small, ranging from 18 to 152 patients, with a total sample size of 880 children and 444 adults. The relative risk of admission for metered dose inhaler spacer vs nebulizer for children was 0.65 (95% confidence interval, 0.4-1.06). Secondary outcomes were equivalent or slightly improved, including duration in the emergency department, changes in respiratory rate, blood gases, pulse, tremor, symptoms score, lung function, and use of steroids. Patients with life-threatening asthma (for example, those considered for ventilation) or other chronic illnesses were excluded."
"What steps can reduce morbidity and mortality caused by hip fractures
Delirium and pain are common following hip fracture. Untreated pain has been shown to increase the risk of delirium in older adults undergoing elective surgery. This study was performed to examine the relationship among pain, analgesics, and other factors on delirium in hip fracture patients. We conducted a prospective cohort study at four New York hospitals that enrolled 541 patients with hip fracture and without delirium. Delirium was identified prospectively by patient interview supplemented by medical record review. Multiple logistic regression was used to identify risk factors. Eighty-seven of 541 patients (16%) became delirious. Among all subjects, risk factors for delirium were cognitive impairment (relative risk, or RR, 3.6; 95% confidence interval, or CI, 1.8-7.2), abnormal blood pressure (RR 2.3, 95% CI 1.2-4.7), and heart failure (RR 2.9, 95% CI 1.6-5.3). Patients who received less than 10 mg of parenteral morphine sulfate equivalents per day were more likely to develop delirium than patients who received more analgesia (RR 5.4, 95% CI 2.4-12.3). Patients who received meperidine were at increased risk of developing delirium as compared with patients who received other opioid analgesics (RR 2.4, 95% CI 1.3-4.5). In cognitively intact patients, severe pain significantly increased the risk of delirium (RR 9.0, 95% CI 1.8-45.2). Using admission data, clinicians can identify patients at high risk for delirium following hip fracture. Avoiding opioids or using very low doses of opioids increased the risk of delirium. Cognitively intact patients with undertreated pain were nine times more likely to develop delirium than patients whose pain was adequately treated. Undertreated pain and inadequate analgesia appear to be risk factors for delirium in frail older adults.","In a cohort study, those patients whose pain was inadequately controlled also had an increased risk for delirium (RR=9.0; 95% CI, 1.8-45.2). Meperidine use increased the risk for delirium compared with other opioid analgesics (RR=2.4; 95% CI, 1.3-4.5)."
"What is the best surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma in chronic carriers of hepatitis B
Chronic hepatitis B infection may cause liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)). Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and liver ultrasonography (US) are used to screen these patients for HCC. It is uncertain whether screening is worthwhile. To review randomized trials on screening for HCC with alpha-fetoprotein and/or liver ultrasonography among people with hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) whether asymptomatic or with clinical liver disease. Relevant reports were searched from electronic databases until August 2002 (The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, The Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, MEDLINE, EMBASE, HealthStar, and the Chinese Medical Literature Electronic Databases, MedCyber) supplemented with manual searches on the bibliographies of papers found and communication to people familiar with chronic hepatitis B. Randomized trials on screening for liver cancer were included irrespective of language. Studies were excluded if the hepatitis B status was uncertain, if patients were not adequately followed, if the screening tests were not sensitive, widely-used ones, or if the test was used for diagnosis rather than screening for HCC. We analyzed independently all the studies considered for inclusion. We wrote to the relevant authors for further information. Data were analyzed with Peto's odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Two trials met the selection criteria. One trial (n = 18,816) compared bi-annual AFP plus US screening with no screening for five years. No data on all-cause mortality were available. The two groups did not differ significantly regarding HCC mortality (OR 0.81; 95% CI 0.54 to 1.22). Number of patients with HCC was significantly increased in the screeened group (OR 1.37; 95% CI 1.00 to 1.88). Most HCCs in the screened group, but none in the control group, were at an early stage. The survival rate of patients with resected HCC in the screened group reached 52.7% after three and five years, but was 0% for those in the control group. The authors' estimated lead-time for HCC was 5.4 months, suggesting that screening prolonged the survival of HCC. Another trial (n = 1069) compared AFP plus US versus AFP screening, but could not decide which approach was superior due to the small sample size (number of detected HCC: OR 0.74; 95% CI 0.26 to 2.12). There are not enough quality trials to support or refute screening of HBsAg-positive patients for HCC. It is possible that screening may be effective, but also that harm caused by screening/treatment may outweigh any gain. More and better-designed large randomized trials are required.",The Cochrane group performed their own analysis on the same data and determined that no statistically significant difference in the disease-specific mortality rates existed between the 2 groups..
"How should we follow athletes after a concussion
Lack of empirical data on recovery time following sport-related concussion hampers clinical decision making about return to play after injury. To prospectively measure immediate effects and natural recovery course relating to symptoms, cognitive functioning, and postural stability following sport-related concussion. Prospective cohort study of 1631 football players from 15 US colleges. All players underwent preseason baseline testing on concussion assessment measures in 1999, 2000, and 2001. Ninety-four players with concussion (based on American Academy of Neurology criteria) and 56 noninjured controls underwent assessment of symptoms, cognitive functioning, and postural stability immediately, 3 hours, and 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and 90 days after injury. Scores on the Graded Symptom Checklist (GSC), Standardized Assessment of Concussion (SAC), Balance Error Scoring System (BESS), and a neuropsychological test battery. No player with concussion was excluded from participation; 79 players with concussion (84%) completed the protocol through day 90. Players with concussion exhibited more severe symptoms (mean GSC score 20.93 [95% confidence interval [CI], 15.65-26.21] points higher than that of controls), cognitive impairment (mean SAC score 2.94 [95% CI, 1.50-4.38] points lower than that of controls), and balance problems (mean BESS score 5.81 [95% CI, -0.67 to 12.30] points higher than that of controls) immediately after concussion. On average, symptoms gradually resolved by day 7 (GSC mean difference, 0.33; 95% CI, -1.41 to 2.06), cognitive functioning improved to baseline levels within 5 to 7 days (day 7 SAC mean difference, -0.03; 95% CI, -1.33 to 1.26), and balance deficits dissipated within 3 to 5 days after injury (day 5 BESS mean difference, -0.31; 95% CI, -3.02 to 2.40). Mild impairments in cognitive processing and verbal memory evident on neuropsychological testing 2 days after concussion resolved by day 7. There were no significant differences in symptoms or functional impairments in the concussion and control groups 90 days after concussion. Collegiate football players may require several days for recovery of symptoms, cognitive dysfunction, and postural instability after concussion. Further research is required to determine factors that predict variability in recovery time after concussion. Standardized measurement of postconcussive symptoms, cognitive functioning, and postural stability may enhance clinical management of athletes recovering from concussion.","A cohort study of US college football players found that while postural stability commonly returns in just a day or 2, cognitive recovery often takes 3 to 5 days, and symptoms last over 7 days post-injury for 1 of 8 concussed athletes."
"What is the most effective treatment for acute low back pain
To determine the effectiveness of chiropractic treatment for patients with low back pain by means of a systematic review of the literature. Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) on chiropractic were identified with a Medline and Embase search (1966-1995), by citation tracking, and by hand searching of the relevant chiropractic reference systems (CRAC and Index to Chiropractic Literature). All RCTs on low back pain that involved chiropractors as therapists. Methodological quality was assessed independently by two reviewers on 14 items covering internal validity, informativeness and study size. Data were extracted on: patients (initial referral, duration of complaints, radiation of pain); outcomes (four different types); and timing of follow-up (short-term, intermediate and long-term). Statistical pooling was intended, according to a preset analysis plan, to include subgroup analysis. Eight RCTs were identified. All RCTs had serious flaws in their design, execution and reporting. Because of the great variety of outcome measures and follow-up timing, there was insufficient data to enable statistical pooling of the RCTs. A narrative review, however, did not provide convincing evidence for the effectiveness of chiropractic for acute or chronic low back pain. There is certainly a need for correctly executed trials. In future research on the effectiveness of chiropractic, guidelines for uniform execution and reporting of RCTs should first be established to enable subsequent statistical pooling in systematic reviews of chiropractic trials.",Evidence is insufficient to support the use of spinal manipulation in patients with acute low back pain because of serious design flaws in the trials.
"Are DMARDs effective for rheumatologic diseases besides rheumatoid arthritis
A double blind, randomised, placebo controlled study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of etanercept to treat adult patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS). Adult patients with AS at 14 European sites were randomly assigned to 25 mg injections of etanercept or placebo twice weekly for 12 weeks. The primary efficacy end point was an improvement of at least 20% in patient reported symptoms, based on the multicomponent Assessments in Ankylosing Spondylitis (ASAS) response criteria (ASAS 20). Secondary end points included ASAS 50 and ASAS 70 responses and improved scores on individual components of ASAS, the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI), acute phase reactants, and spinal mobility tests. Safety was evaluated during scheduled visits. Of 84 patients enrolled, 45 received etanercept and 39 received placebo. Significantly more etanercept patients than placebo patients responded at the ASAS 20 level as early as week 2, and sustained differences were evident up to week 12. Significantly more etanercept patients reported ASAS 50 responses at all times and ASAS 70 responses at weeks 2, 4, and 8; reported lower composite and fatigue BASDAI scores; had lower acute phase reactant levels; and had improved spinal flexion. Etanercept was well tolerated. Most adverse events were mild to moderate; the only between-group difference was injection site reactions, which occurred significantly more often in etanercept patients. Etanercept is a well tolerated and effective treatment for reducing clinical symptoms and signs of AS.","A study (84 patients) showed that 60% of patients on etanercept vs 20% on placebo had good clinical benefit at only 12 weeks (P<.001, NNT=2.5)."
"Is antibiotic prophylaxis effective for recurrent acute otitis media
To determine the effectiveness of amoxicillin administered continuously twice daily vs. once daily vs. placebo to prevent new episodes of acute otitis media (AOM). Randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial at a hospital-based general pediatric clinic and a private pediatric practice, both in Denver, CO. One hundred ninety-four children (age 3 months through 6 years) were enrolled with 3 documented AOM episodes within the prior 6 months, without ventilating tubes or associated anatomic defects, immunodeficiency disorders or allergy to penicillin. Thirty-six were noncompliant and were excluded from the study, leaving 158 evaluable subjects. The amoxicillin dosage was 20 mg/kg/day either bid or qd. After randomization to placebo twice daily (bid), amoxicillin once daily (qd)/placebo qd or amoxicillin bid, patients were followed monthly and were also seen for upper respiratory infection symptoms during enrollment in the trial. Development of two new AOM episodes terminated the patients from the study. Incidence density (ID) measurements were calculated for all study subjects and were stratified by age and season. Overall study subjects in all 3 arms of the trial had 7243 days at risk during which time they developed 56 new AOM episodes for a annual ID of 2.82. There were no significant differences in the IDs between amoxicillin qd vs. bid or amoxicillin (bid or qd) vs. placebo. After stratifying by age and season of enrollment, there were no significant differences in ID rates among the 3 groups. The proportion of subjects remaining otitis-free was 63% for the placebo group, 64% for once daily amoxicillin and 61% for twice daily amoxicillin. While once-a-day dosing was equivalent to twice-a-day dosing for amoxicillin prophylaxis, there was no benefit of amoxicillin prophylaxis compared with a placebo control in preventing new AOM episodes. Because of the potential of excessive antibiotic use to promote the acquisition of resistant pneumococci and the lack of effectiveness in this trial, routine use of amoxicillin prophylaxis should be discouraged.","A randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study of prophylaxis for ear infections enrolled 194 children aged 3 months to 6 years with at least 3 documented acute otitis media episodes in the preceding 6 months. The children were given amoxicillin (20 mg/kg/d) either once daily (n=55) or divided twice daily (n=44) or placebo (n=59). Excluding 36 noncompliant subjects, the percentages without a recurrent episode were 63% for the placebo group, 64% for the once-daily amoxicillin group, and 61% for the twice-daily amoxicillin group. There was no significant difference in the incidence of new acute otitis media episodes among the children in the 3 groups."
"When and how should you evaluate a child for obstructive sleep apnea
To assess the presence of a first night effect (FNE) in children and adolescents and to examine if a single night polysomnography (PSG) is sufficient for diagnosing obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS). Prospective case study of 70 patients (group 1: 2-6 years, n = 22; group 2: 7-12 years, n = 32; group 3: 13-17 years, n = 16) referred for OSAS. Diagnostic criteria for OSAS: one or more of the following: (1) obstructive apnoea index (OAI) > or =1; (2) obstructive apnoea hypopnoea index (oAHI) > or =2; (3) SaO2 < or =89% in association with obstruction. In all age groups, but mainly in the oldest children, REMS increased during the second night, mainly at the expense of stage 2 sleep. The first night PSG correctly identified OSAS in 86%, 91%, and 100% of the children for groups 1, 2, and 3 respectively. This represents 9% false negatives for OSAS when only the first night PSG was used. All cases missed had mild OSAS, except for one with oAHI >5 on night 2. There were also seven patients with OSAS on night 1 but with a normal PSG on night 2: all had oAHI <5. There is a FNE in children and adolescents. A single night PSG is sufficient for diagnosing OSAS, but in cases with a suggestive history and examination and with a negative first night, a second night study might be advisable.","An investigator-blinded RCT, scored 20-minute recordings of ""worst breathing"" in 59 consecutive children referred for snoring or nocturnal breathing problems, 47% of whom had sleep apnea. Results: PPV=62%, NPV=83%, sensitivity=88%, specificity=52%."
"What test is the best for diagnosing infectious mononucleosis
To determine the sensitivity and specificity of 2 modern hematology analyzers in flagging heterophile-positive patients; to determine if heterophile-positive, instrument-flagged specimens contain a larger number or a different spectrum of atypical lymphocytes; to document the overall sensitivity and specificity of Hoagland's morphologic criteria in identifying heterophile-positive patients in an outpatient population with a clinical diagnosis of mononucleosis; and to examine whether individual morphologic features might aid in the diagnosis of suspected infectious mononucleosis. A prospective study of patients referred with a clinical diagnosis of infectious mononucleosis who subsequently tested positive for the heterophile antibody. The control group consisted of a similar population of patients who tested negative for the heterophile antibody. Hematology profiles of peripheral blood samples were determined with Coulter STKS and Sysmex NE-8000 analyzers. A corresponding Wright-Giemsa-stained blood smear was subsequently examined by a single skilled technologist, who performed a 200-cell white blood cell differential and a 200-cell lymphocyte differential. A specific morphologic search was made for the presence of smudge cells or lymphocytes with cloverleaf nuclei. Using a combination of all flagging criteria, the 2 analyzers identified 156 (86.2%) of 181 heterophile-positive patients as meriting further review. The sensitivity and specificity values of the Coulter analyzer in predicting positive heterophile status for the blast flag were 41% and 97.1%, respectively; for the variant lymphocyte flags, 72.4% and 79.1%, respectively; and for both flags, 40% and 98.1%, respectively. For the Sysmex analyzer, the sensitivity and specificity values in predicting positive heterophile status for the blast flag were 43.4% and 88.6%, respectively; for the variant lymphocyte flag, 15.8% and 90.8%, respectively; and for both flags, 10.5% and 96%, respectively. Considering the classic criteria developed by Hoagland, a lymphocytosis of at least 50% was present in 120 (66.3%) heterophile-positive patients, while an atypical lymphocytosis of at least 10% of the total WBC count was noted in 135 patients (74.6%). The sensitivity and specificity values of a lymphocytosis > or =50% for diagnosing heterophile-positive status were 66.3% and 84.5%, respectively, while the sensitivity and specificity of an atypical lymphocytosis > or =10% were 74.6% and 92.3%, respectively. The presence of smudge cells or cloverleaf lymphocyte nuclei was verified as having high specificity but low sensitivity for suggesting a diagnosis of infectious mononucleosis. Although a number of patients did not meet Hoagland's criteria for the diagnosis of infectious mononucleosis, the flagging systems of modern hematology analyzers successfully identified most cases as requiring further review.",A validating cohort study compared peripheral blood samples in 181 patients aged >16 years with a clinical diagnosis of infectious mononucleosis confirmed by a positive heterophile antibody test with those from 181 similar patients with a negative test. An increased percentage of lymphocytes and atypical lymphocytes were associated with higher sensitivity and specificity for infectious mononucleosis.
"How should patients with mitral regurgitation be followed
Surgical correction of mitral regurgitation in patients with no or mild symptoms remains controversial, particularly because the impact of preoperative symptoms on postoperative outcome is unknown. The long-term outcome of 478 patients with organic mitral regurgitation (199 in NYHA functional class I/II and 279 in class III/IV before surgery) operated on between 1984 and 1991 was analyzed. In patients in NYHA class I/II before surgery compared with those in class III/IV, postoperative long-term survival was higher (at 10 years, 76+/-5% versus 48+/-4%, P<0.0001), with lower operative mortality (0.5% versus 5.4%, P=0.003) and better late survival (P<0.0001). Comparison of observed and expected survival showed identical curves in patients in class I/II before surgery (P=0.18), whereas excess mortality was observed in patients in class III/IV before surgery (P<0.0001). Excess mortality associated with severe symptoms was also confirmed in all subgroups (all P<0.003) and in multivariate analysis (P=0.0036; adjusted hazard ratio [95% CI], 1.81 [1.21 to 2.70]). In patients with organic mitral regurgitation, preoperative functional class III/IV symptoms are associated with excess short- and long-term postoperative mortality independently of all baseline characteristics. These data should lead to consideration of surgical correction of severe organic mitral regurgitation when no or minimal symptoms are present in patients at low operative risk, especially if repair is feasible.","Another cohort study of patients undergoing surgery for severe mitral regurgitation compared the outcomes of 199 patients with new york heart association class I/II symptoms with those of 279 patients with new york heart association class III/IV symptoms. Patients with new york heart association class I/II had better operative outcomes (0.5% vs 5.4%) and better 5-year (90% vs 73%) and 10-year (76% vs 48%) survival than patients with more severe symptoms. In multivariate analysis, new york heart association functional class remained inversely associated with survival."
"Is training patients in self-examination an effective way to screen for melanoma
Self-detection of suspicious pigmented skin lesion combined with rapid referral to dermatologic centres is the key strategy in the fight against melanoma. The investigation of factors associated with pattern of detection of melanoma (self- vs. nonself-detection) may be useful to refine educational strategies for the future. We investigated the frequency of melanoma self-detection in a Mediterranean population at intermediate melanoma risk. A multicentric survey identified 816 consecutive cases of cutaneous melanoma in the period January to December 2001 in 11 Italian clinical centres belonging to the Italian Multidisciplinary Group on Melanoma. All patients filled a standardized questionnaire and were clinically examined by expert dermatologists. Self-detected melanomas were 40.6%, while the remaining lesions were detected by a dermatologist (18.5%), the family physician (15.2%), other specialists (5%), the spouse (12.5%), a friend or someone else (8.2%). Variables associated with self-detected melanomas were female sex, young age, absence of atypical nevi, knowledge of the ABCD rule, habit of performing skin self-examination. Self-detected melanomas did not differ from nonself-detected tumours in term of lesion thickness; however, patients with self-detected melanomas waited a longer period before having a diagnostic confirmation (patient's delay) (> 3 months: odds ratio, 3.89; 95% confidence interval, 2.74-5.53). In order to reduce the patients' delays, educational messages should adequately stress the need for a prompt referral to a physician once a suspicious pigmented lesion is self-detected.","A retrospective series of 816 consecutive cases of newly diagnosed melanoma investigated the frequency of self-detection in a Mediterranean population at intermediate risk. Subjects were statistically more likely to find melanoma themselves if they had a lesion on the lower limbs, were of younger age (49.8 vs 52.9 years of age), had fewer atypical nevi, had >8 years education, were knowledgeable about the characteristic features of melanoma, and performed regular skin self-examination (P<.01 for all comparisons)."
"Which treatments work best for hemorrhoids
Hemorrhoids are one of the most common anorectal disorders. The Milligan-Morgan open hemorrhoidectomy is the most widely practiced surgical technique used for the management of hemorrhoids and is considered the current ""gold standard"". Circular stapled hemorrhoidopexy was first described by Longo in 1998 as alternative to conventional excisional hemorrhoidectomy. Early, small randomized-controlled trials comparing stapled hemorrhoidopexy with traditional excisional surgery have shown it to be less painful and that it is associated with quicker recovery. The reports also suggest a better patient acceptance and a higher compliance with day-case procedures potentially making it more economical To compare the use of circular stapling devices and conventional excisional techniques in patients with symptomatic hemorrhoids. We searched all the major electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) from 1998 to May 2006. All randomized controlled trials comparing stapled hemorrhoidopexy to conventional excisional hemorrhoidal surgeries were included. Data were collected on a data sheet. When appropriate, an Odds Ratio was generated using a random effects model. Patients undergoing circular stapled hemorrhoidopexy (SH) were significantly more likely to have recurrent hemorrhoids in long term follow up at all time points than those receiving conventional hemorrhoidectomy (CH) (7 trials, 537 patients, OR 3.85, CI 1.47-10.07, p=0.006). There were 23 recurrences out of 269 patients in the stapled group versus only 4 out of 268 patients in the conventional group. Similarly, in trials where there was follow up of one year or more, SH was associated with a greater proportion of patients with hemorrhoid recurrence(5 trials, 417 patients, OR 3.60, CI 1.24-10.49, p=0.02). Furthermore, a significantly higher proportion of patients with SH complained of the symptom of prolapse at all time points (8 studies, 798 patients, OR 2.96, CI 1.33-6.58, p=0.008). In studies with follow up of greater than one year, the same significant outcome was found (6 studies, 628 patients, OR 2.68, CI 0.98-7.34, p=0.05). Non significant trends in favor of SH were seen in pain, pruritus ani, and fecal urgency. All other clinical parameters showed trends favoring CH AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Stapled hemorrhoidopexy is associated with a higher long-term risk of hemorrhoid recurrence and the symptom of prolapse. It is also likely to be associated with a higher likelihood of long-term symptom recurrence and the need for additional operations compared to conventional excisional hemorrhoid surgeries. Patients should be informed of these risks when being offered the stapled hemorrhoidopexy as surgical therapy. If hemorrhoid recurrence and prolapse are the most important clinical outcomes, then conventional excisional surgery remains the ""gold standard"" in the surgical treatment of internal hemorrhoids.",A Cochrane systematic review of 12 RCTs that compared conventional hemorrhoidectomy with stapled hemorrhoidectomy in patients with grades I to III hemorrhoids found a lower rate of recurrence (follow-up ranged from 6 to 39 months) in patients who had conventional hemorrhoidectomy (NNT=14). Conventional hemorrhoidectomy showed a nonsignificant trend in decreased bleeding and decreased incontinence.
"How do we evaluate a marginally low B12 level
To measure the prevalence of cobalamin (vitamin B12) deficiency in geriatric outpatients as documented by both low serum cobalamin levels and elevations of serum methylmalonic acid and homocysteine and to determine the response to cobalamin treatment. Prospective study screening elderly subjects for cobalamin deficiency using radiodilution cobalamin assays as well as stable isotope dilution gas chromatography-mass spectrometry methylmalonic acid and homocysteine assays. In patients with serum cobalamin levels < or = 300 pg/mL, the response to cobalamin treatment in the group with levels of methylmalonic acid and/or homocysteine > 3 standard deviations (SD) above the mean for normals was compared with that of those without such elevations. Outpatient geriatric clinics at the VA Medical Center and University Health Sciences Center, Denver, CO. One-hundred and fifty-two consecutive outpatients, ages 65 to 99, were screened. Twenty-nine subjects with serum cobalamin levels < or = 300 pg/mL were prospectively evaluated and treated with cobalamin. Cobalamin, methylmalonic acid, homocysteine, complete blood counts, neurologic examination, and neuropsychological testing. The prevalence of cobalamin deficiency as defined by a serum cobalamin level < or = 300 pg/mL and levels of serum methylmalonic acid and/or homocysteine elevated to > 3 SD was 14.5% of the screened outpatients. A similar proportion of patients with low normal serum cobalamin levels (between 201 and 300 pg/mL) demonstrated elevated metabolites > 3 SD (56%) compared with patients with low serum cobalamin levels (< or = 200 pg/mL) (62%). Cobalamin therapy caused a marked fall or complete correction of the elevated methylmalonic acid and homocysteine levels in each patient who was treated prospectively. Results for complete blood count, lactate dehydrogenase, bilirubin, baseline neurologic score, and baseline neuropsychologic scores did not differ in the group of patients with elevated metabolites compared with those with normal metabolites. The mean red cell volume fell significantly in the patients with elevated metabolites after 6 months of cobalamin treatment. One patient with elevated metabolites had marked improvement in his neurologic abnormalities after 6 months of cobalamin treatment. There was a high (14.5%) prevalence of cobalamin deficiency as demonstrated by elevations in serum methylmalonic acid and homocysteine in addition to low or low normal serum cobalamin levels in elderly outpatients. The serum cobalamin level was insensitive for screening since similar numbers of patients with low normal serum cobalamin levels of 201-300 pg/mL compared with patients with low cobalamin levels (< or = 200 pg/mL) had markedly elevated metabolites which fell with cobalamin treatment. Additional studies will be required to define the full clinical benefit from treatment with Cbl in elderly subjects.",A low-normal B12 level is 150 to 350 pg/mL. Levels less than 150 pg/mL indicate deficiency. Levels greater than 350 pg/mL indicate adequate B12 supply.
"How effective are hypertension self-care interventions
Lack of adherence to blood pressure lowering medication is a major reason for poor control of hypertension worldwide. Interventions to improve adherence to antihypertensive medication have been evaluated in randomised trials but it is unclear which interventions are effective. To determine the effectiveness of interventions aiming to increase adherence to blood pressure lowering medication in adults with high blood pressure All-language search of all articles (any year) in the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (CCTR), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL in April 2002. RCTs of interventions to increase adherence to blood pressure lowering medication in adults with essential hypertension in primary care, with adherence to medication and blood pressure control as outcomes Two authors extracted data independently and in duplicate and assessed each study according to the criteria outlined by the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook. We included 38 studies testing 58 different interventions and containing data on 15519 patients. The studies were conducted in nine countries between 1975 and 2000. The duration of follow-up ranged from two to 60 months. Due to heterogeneity between studies in terms of interventions and the methods used to measure adherence, we did not pool the results. Simplifying dosing regimens increased adherence in seven out of nine studies, with a relative increase in adherence of 8 per cent to 19.6 per cent. Motivational strategies were successful in 10 out of 24 studies with generally small increases in adherence up to a maximum of 23 per cent. Complex interventions involving more than one technique increased adherence in eight out of 18 studies, ranging from 5 per cent to a maximum of 41 per cent. Patient education alone seemed largely unsuccessful. Reducing the number of daily doses appears to be effective in increasing adherence to blood pressure lowering medication and should be tried as a first line strategy, although there is less evidence of an effect on blood pressure reduction. Some motivational strategies and complex interventions appear promising, but we need more evidence on their effect through carefully designed RCTs.","In a Cochrane review, only 1 of 6 studies of patient education intervention demonstrated improved adherence, but the trial was small (n=110), and the effect was not seen in the other studies (total of 1103 patients)."
"Does stimulant therapy help adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
Despite the increasing recognition of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adults, there are few controlled trials demonstrating the effectiveness of pharmacological treatments, particularly with nonstimulants. One controlled trial found bupropion SR more effective than placebo in the treatment of ADHD adults. We conducted a controlled study to contrast the effectiveness of bupropion SR and methylphenidate to placebo in ADHD adults. A randomized, double-blind, parallel design was used in this study. Following a 7-day placebo lead-in, 30 ADHD (DSM-IV) subjects (18-60 years old) were randomized to bupropion, methylphenidate, or placebo for 7 weeks. Methylphenidate was titrated over 1 week to a maximum dose of 0.9 mg/kg/d divided into 3 doses while bupropion was titrated over 2 weeks to a maximum dose of 200 mg A.M. and 100 mg P.M. Response rates based on Clinical Global Impression improvement ratings in patients receiving bupropion, methylphenidate, and placebo were 64, 50, and 27%, respectively. The difference in response rates between active treatment and placebo was not statistically significant (p = 0.14). Neuropsychological testing demonstrated trends favoring drug treatment on measures of immediate recall and verbal fluency. While bupropion SR may be a viable clinical alternative for adults with ADHD, further investigation is needed.","A 7-week randomized controlled trial compared methylphenidate with sustained-release buproprion. Thirty out of 37 subjects completed at least 1 week of the study. The primary indicator of a favorable response was the Clinical Global Impression Scale. The rate of response was 50% for methylphenidate, 64% for sustained-release buproprion, and 27% for placebo (P<.14)."
"How should patients with mitral regurgitation be followed
The optimal timing for surgery in patients with mitral regurgitation is disputed. Because of the frequency of left ventricular dysfunction, which is difficult to predict, early surgery has been recommended, but its potential benefits have not been demonstrated. The outcomes of 221 patients (mean age, 65 +/- 13 years; 71% males) with flail leaflets diagnosed with two-dimensional echocardiography between 1980 and 1989 who were eligible for operation were analyzed. Group I comprised 63 patients who had early mitral valve surgery (within 1 month after diagnosis). Group II comprised 158 patients initially treated conservatively (80 of whom were operated on later). Group I patients were younger (P=.009), had more symptoms (P<.0001), and were more frequently in atrial fibrillation (P=.023) than group II patients. There was no difference in ejection fraction between the groups. The early surgery strategy was followed by an improved overall survival rate (P=.028) and a lower incidence of cardiovascular deaths (P=.025), congestive heart failure (P=.046), and new chronic atrial fibrillation (P=.032), as confirmed by multivariate analysis (adjusted risk ratios of 0.31, 0.18, 0.38, and 0.05, respectively; all P<.02). In patients with mitral regurgitation due to flail leaflets, the strategy of early surgery versus conservative management is associated with an improved long-term survival rate, decreased cardiac mortality, and decreased morbidity after diagnosis. This outcome advantage suggests that early surgery is a reasonable treatment option to be considered in low-risk candidates with repairable valves and severe mitral regurgitation.",A cohort compared the outcomes of patients undergoing early surgery (within 1 month of diagnosis) with those initially treated medically. Eight patients were excluded from this study because they were unsuitable candidates for surgery. The remaining 221 patients were followed based on their original group assignment of early surgery (63 patients) or medical management (158 patients). Patients undergoing early surgery were more likely to have symptoms at enrollment than those managed medically. Patients in the early surgery group had better 5-year (89% vs 78%) and 10-year (78% vs 65%; P<.05 for both comparisons) survival and were less likely to develop congestive heart failure or atrial fibrillation. These differences remained significant after multivariate adjustment for potential confounders.
"Is an outpatient workup safe for patients with a transient ischemic attack
Information on 1,343 hospitalized patients in the Cornell Neurology Database with final diagnoses of transient ischemic attacks (TIA), reversible ischemic neurologic deficits (RIND), or ischemic stroke was examined in order to determine the duration of ischemic deficits. Episodes resolved within the first 24 hours (classic definition of TIA) in 382 of the patients (28.4%) and between days 1 and 7 (consistent with RIND) in 34 (2.5%). In 191 of the 382 patients with traditionally-defined TIAs (50.0%), episodes lasted less than 30 minutes, and in another 37 (9.7%), from 30 to 60 minutes. Of 1,115 patients with deficits lasting at least 60 minutes, only 154 (13.8%) resolved within 24 hours and could thus be considered to have had a TIA. Resolution within the next hour occurred in only 39 of 1,152 patients (3.4%) with a deficit at 30 minutes, 21 of 1,115 patients (1.9%) with a deficit at 60 minutes, 19 of 1,113 patients (1.7%) with a deficit at 90 minutes, and 16 of 1,094 patients (1.5%) with a deficit at 120 minutes. The data suggest that as currently managed, patients with a deficit persisting at least 60 minutes have less than a 2% chance of resolving spontaneously during any subsequent 1-hour period. Rapid resolution after instituting a new treatment in relatively few additional patients would suggest a therapeutic effect, even in a nonrandomized trial.","Transient ischemic attack is a temporary, focal brain or retinal deficit caused by vascular disease that clears completely in less than 24 hours."
"What is the most effective diagnostic evaluation of streptococcal pharyngitis
Sore throat is a common complaint, and identifying patients with group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis (strep throat) is an important task for clinicians. Previous reviews have not systematically reviewed and synthesized the evidence. To review the precision and accuracy of the clinical examination in diagnosing strep throat. MEDLINE search for articles about diagnosis of strep throat using history-taking and physical examination. Large blinded, prospective studies (having > or =300 patients with sore throat) reporting history and physical examination data and using throat culture as the reference standard were included. Of 917 articles identified by the search, 9 met all inclusion criteria. Pairs of authors independently reviewed each article and used consensus to resolve discrepancies. The most useful findings for evaluating the likelihood of strep throat are presence of tonsillar exudate, pharyngeal exudate, or exposure to strep throat infection in the previous 2 weeks (positive likelihood ratios, 3.4, 2.1, and 1.9, respectively) and the absence of tender anterior cervical nodes, tonsillar enlargement, or exudate (negative likelihood ratios, 0.60, 0.63, and 0.74, respectively). No individual element of history-taking or physical examination is accurate enough by itself to rule in or rule out strep throat. Three validated clinical prediction rules are described for adult and pediatric populations. While no single element of history-taking or physical examination is sufficiently accurate to exclude or diagnose strep throat, a well-validated clinical prediction rule can be useful and can help physicians make more informed use of rapid antigen tests and throat cultures.","A systematic review of the diagnosis of group a beta-hemolytic streptococci evaluated the accuracy of history and physical exam elements. Clinical prediction rules based on selected symptoms and signs can identify patients at low risk for GABHS. The 4 Centor criteria (history of fever, anterior cervical adenopathy, tonsillar exudates, absence of cough) are well validated in adult populations, while other clinical prediction rules (such as McIssac) are validated in populations with children and adults. The number of criteria present determines the likelihood ratio (LR), with which to calculate the posttest probability of GABHS."
"Who should get hepatitis A vaccination
Routine vaccination of children is the most effective way to reduce hepatitis A incidence nationwide over time. Since licensure of hepatitis A vaccine in 1995, this strategy has been implemented incrementally, starting with the recommendation of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) in 1996 to vaccinate children living in communities with the highest rates of infection and disease. These updated recommendations represent the next phase of this hepatitis A immunization strategy. Vaccination of children living in states and communities with consistently elevated rates of hepatitis A will provide protection from disease and is expected to reduce the overall incidence of hepatitis A. This report updates the ACIP's 1996 recommendations on the prevention of hepatitis A through immunization (MMWR 1996;45:[No. RR-151) and includes a) new data about the epidemiology of hepatitis A; b) recent findings about the effectiveness of community-based hepatitis A vaccination programs; and c) recommendations for the routine vaccination of children in states, counties, and communities with rates that are twice the 1987-1997 national average or greater (i.e., > or = 20 cases per 100,000 population) and consideration of routine vaccination of children in states, counties, and communities with rates exceeding the 1987-1997 national average (i.e., > or = 10 but <20 cases per 100,000 population). Unchanged in this report are previous recommendations regarding the vaccination of persons in groups at increased risk for hepatitis A or its adverse consequences and recommendations regarding the use of immune globulin for protection against hepatitis A.","In the United States, children living in states with increased hepatitis a virus incidence rates are also considered to be at high risk."
"Do allergy shots help seasonal allergies more than antihistamines and nasal steroids
Drug treatment and specific immunotherapy (SIT) are both effective in seasonal rhinoconjunctivitis, but the former acts only on allergic symptoms while the latter modifies the natural history of the disease. Only a few studies compared the clinical efficacy of the two treatments with contrasting results. We planned a study to compare the efficacy of SIT (15 patients) and drug treatment (15 patients) in moderate to severe seasonal rhinoconjunctivitis caused by sensitization to grass pollen. SIT was performed by a 5-grass extract standardized in IR and absorbed onto calcium phosphate (Phostal, Stallergénes, Antony, France) using the conventional build-up phase in 12 weeks and a maintenance treatment with monthly injection for three years. Drug treatment was done with cetirizine as antihistamine, mometasone furoate as nasal topical steroid, and levocabastine eyedrops. All patients registered during the pollen season their symptoms and drug consumption. After one year 12 of 15 patients treated with SIT had less symptoms and drug consumption in respect to baseline compared to none in drug treated group (p = 0.021) and after three years 15 of 15 were improved in group A compared to one of 15 in group B (p = 0.008). These findings indicate an higher efficacy of SIT in patients with seasonal rhinitis not only in the long term but also in the first year of treatment.",A study allowed patients to choose a treatment arm; it found that immunotherapy was superior to treatment with antihistamines and nasal steroids for patients who chose it.
"How accurate is the clinical diagnosis of pneumonia
Agreement between 24 physicians on the presence or absence of respiratory signs was investigated. The physicians were divided into six sets of 4; each set examined 4 patients with well-defined chest signs. There was generally poor agreement about particular signs. Overall, the 4 physicians in a set were in complete agreement only 55% of the time. Some signs such as wheezing seemed to be more reliably elicited than others such as whispering pectoriloquy. Comparison of diagnoses based on the clinical findings with the correct diagnoses supported by investigations showed that 28% of physicians' diagnoses were incorrect. The more often the examiners differed from the majority on the presence or absence of a sign, the more likely they were to make an incorrect diagnosis. A ranked order of the reliability with which chest signs are elicited would improve the teaching of chest medicine.","In a study, 24 physicians examined 24 patients with a variety of respiratory conditions: only 4 had pneumonia on chest x-ray. The most reliable findings (dullness to percussion and wheezing) had only fair agreement among examiners (kappa approximately 0.5)."
"What is the best therapy for superficial thrombophlebitis
The optimal treatment of superficial thrombophlebitis of the leg is undefined. The main study objective was to assess the efficacy and safety of unmonitored high doses as compared to low doses of unfractionated heparin (UFH) for prevention of venous thromboembolic complications in patients with superficial thrombophlebitis of the thigh. Sixty consecutive patients with acute thrombophlebitis of the great saphenous vein, as assessed by ultrasonography, were randomized to subcutaneous injection twice daily of UFH in high unmonitored doses (12,500 IU for one week followed by 10,000 IU) or prophylactic doses (5,000 IU) for four weeks. The rate of asymptomatic involvement of the deep venous system and/or symptomatic thromboembolic events during a six-month follow-up period was assessed and compared between the two study groups. Six of the 30 patients (20.0 %; 95% CI, 7.7 to 38.6) randomized to low-dose UFH developed symptomatic or asymptomatic events as compared to 1 of the 30 patients (3.3%; 95% CI, 0.07 to 17.2) who received high-dose UFH (p=0.05 by one-sided Fisher's exact test). No patient experienced major bleeding complications in either group. The results of this study suggest that in patients with acute thrombophlebitis of the thigh unmonitored high doses of UFH are more effective than prophylactic doses of UFH for prevention of venous thromboembolic complications and do not enhance the risk of bleeding complications.","In a recent trial, patients randomized to subcutaneous heparin at 12,500 units twice daily for a week followed by 10,000 units twice daily had fewer vascular complications of proximal saphenous vein thrombosis than those receiving heparin at 5000 units twice daily (6/30 in the low-dose group and 1/30 in the high-dose group; P<.05; number needed to treat [NNT]=6). There were no bleeding complications in either group."
"Which lifestyle interventions effectively lower low density lipoprotein cholesterol
To evaluate the effectiveness of a training program for physician-delivered nutrition counseling, alone and in combination with an office-support program, on dietary fat intake, weight, and blood low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in patients with hyperlipidemia. Forty-five primary care internists at the Fallon Community Health Plan, a central Massachusetts health maintenance organization, were randomized by site into 3 groups: (1) usual care; (2) physician nutrition counseling training; and (3) physician nutrition counseling training plus an office-support program. Eleven hundred sixty-two of their patients with blood total cholesterol levels in the highest 25th percentile, having previously scheduled physician visits, were recruited. Physicians in groups 2 and 3 attended a 3-hour training program on the use of brief patient-centered interactive counseling and the use of an office-support program that included in-office prompts, algorithms, and simple dietary assessment tools. Primary outcome measures included change at 1-year of follow-up in percentage of energy intake from saturated fat; weight; and blood low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Improvement was seen in all 3 primary outcome measures, but was limited to patients in group 3. Compared with group 1, patients in group 3 had average reductions of 1.1 percentage points in percent of energy from saturated fat (a 10.3% decrease) (P = .01); a reduction in weight of 2.3 kg (P<.001); and a decrease of 0.10 mmol/L (3.8 mg/dL) in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level (P = .10). Average time for the initial counseling intervention in group 3 was 8.2 minutes, 5.5 minutes more than in the control group. Brief supported physician nutrition counseling can produce beneficial changes in diet, weight, and blood lipids.",An randomized controlled trials (N=1162) lasting 1 year found that nutrition counseling by primary care physicians resulted in no significant change in LDL-C compared with usual care.
"Which tests are the most useful for diagnosing pelvic inflammatory disease
Careful detection and treatment of pelvic inflammatory disease are essential for the prevention of adverse sequelae. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic test characteristics of clinical criteria for the diagnosis of pelvic inflammatory disease. We performed a cross-sectional analysis of the baseline characteristics of 651 patients enrolled in a multicenter randomized treatment trial for pelvic inflammatory disease. Clinical and laboratory findings were recorded for all patients, and endometrial sampling was performed. We calculated sensitivity and specificity and performed receiver operating characteristic curve analysis and multivariate logistic regression, using histologic endometritis as the criterion standard. The minimal criteria for pelvic inflammatory disease, as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, had a sensitivity of 83%, in comparison with a 95% sensitivity for adnexal tenderness (P =.001). Of the supportive clinical criteria, the finding most highly associated with endometritis was a positive test result for Chlamydia trachomatis or Neisseria gonorrhoeae (adjusted odds ratio, 4.3; 95% confidence interval, 2.89--6.63). A multivariate logistic regression model indicated that combinations of criteria significantly improve the prediction of endometritis. Sensitivity can be maximized by using the presence of adnexal tenderness as a minimal criterion for the diagnosis of pelvic inflammatory disease, and supportive criteria are helpful in estimating the probability of endometritis.",Cross-sectional analysis of a multisite US randomized treatment trial supported using adnexal tenderness as a minimum clinical criterion to increase sensitivity.
"What medications are effective for treating symptoms of premenstrual syndrome PMS
To evaluate the efficacy of progesterone and progestogens in the management of premenstrual syndrome. Systematic review of published randomised, placebo controlled trials. Studies reviewed: 10 trials of progesterone therapy (531 women) and four trials of progestogen therapy (378 women). Proportion of women whose symptoms showed improvement with progesterone preparations (suppositories and oral micronised). Proportion of women whose symptoms showed improvement with progestogens. Secondary analysis of efficacy of progesterone and progestogens in managing physical and behavioural symptoms. Overall standardised mean difference for all trials that assessed efficacy of progesterone (by both routes of administration) was -0.028 (95% confidence interval -0.017 to -0.040). The odds ratio was 1.05 (1.03 to 1.08) in favour of progesterone, indicating no clinically important difference between progesterone and placebo. For progestogens the overall standardised mean was -0.036 (-0.014 to -0.060), which corresponds to an odds ratio of 1.07 (1.03 to 1.11) showing a statistically, but not clinically, significant improvement for women taking progestogens. The evidence from these meta-analyses does not support the use of progesterone or progestogens in the management of premenstrual syndrome.",A meta-analysis of progesterone found no evidence to support its efficacy.
"Do antioxidants vitamins C, E improve outcomes in patients with coronary artery disease
It has been suggested that increased intake of various antioxidant vitamins reduces the incidence rates of vascular disease, cancer, and other adverse outcomes. 20,536 UK adults (aged 40-80) with coronary disease, other occlusive arterial disease, or diabetes were randomly allocated to receive antioxidant vitamin supplementation (600 mg vitamin E, 250 mg vitamin C, and 20 mg beta-carotene daily) or matching placebo. Intention-to-treat comparisons of outcome were conducted between all vitamin-allocated and all placebo-allocated participants. An average of 83% of participants in each treatment group remained compliant during the scheduled 5-year treatment period. Allocation to this vitamin regimen approximately doubled the plasma concentration of alpha-tocopherol, increased that of vitamin C by one-third, and quadrupled that of beta-carotene. Primary outcomes were major coronary events (for overall analyses) and fatal or non-fatal vascular events (for subcategory analyses), with subsidiary assessments of cancer and of other major morbidity. There were no significant differences in all-cause mortality (1446 [14.1%] vitamin-allocated vs 1389 [13.5%] placebo-allocated), or in deaths due to vascular (878 [8.6%] vs 840 [8.2%]) or non-vascular (568 [5.5%] vs 549 [5.3%]) causes. Nor were there any significant differences in the numbers of participants having non-fatal myocardial infarction or coronary death (1063 [10.4%] vs 1047 [10.2%]), non-fatal or fatal stroke (511 [5.0%] vs 518 [5.0%]), or coronary or non-coronary revascularisation (1058 [10.3%] vs 1086 [10.6%]). For the first occurrence of any of these ""major vascular events"", there were no material differences either overall (2306 [22.5%] vs 2312 [22.5%]; event rate ratio 1.00 [95% CI 0.94-1.06]) or in any of the various subcategories considered. There were no significant effects on cancer incidence or on hospitalisation for any other non-vascular cause. Among the high-risk individuals that were studied, these antioxidant vitamins appeared to be safe. But, although this regimen increased blood vitamin concentrations substantially, it did not produce any significant reductions in the 5-year mortality from, or incidence of, any type of vascular disease, cancer, or other major outcome.","A randomized, placebo-controlled study of simvastatin 40 mg and antioxidants (vitamin E 600 mg, vitamin C 250 mg, beta-carotene 20 mg) enrolled 20,536 adults aged 40 to 80 years with known coronary artery disease or high risk for CAD. No significant difference was found in all-cause mortality (RR, 1.04), major coronary events (RR, 1.02), any stroke (RR, 0.99), or any major vascular event (RR, 1.00). The investigators found no evidence of an adverse affect of the antioxidants on the substantial outcome benefits demonstrated with 40 mg daily of simvastatin."
"Is osteoporosis screening in postmenopausal women effective
Large segments of the population at risk for osteoporosis and fracture have not been evaluated, and the usefulness of peripheral measurements for short-term prediction of fracture risk is uncertain. To describe the occurrence of low bone mineral density (BMD) in postmenopausal women, its risk factors, and fracture incidence during short-term follow-up. The National Osteoporosis Risk Assessment, a longitudinal observational study initiated September 1997 to March 1999, with approximately 12 months of subsequent follow-up. A total of 200 160 ambulatory postmenopausal women aged 50 years or older with no previous osteoporosis diagnosis, derived from 4236 primary care practices in 34 states. Baseline BMD T scores, obtained from peripheral bone densitometry performed at the heel, finger, or forearm; risk factors for low BMD, derived from questionnaire responses; and clinical fracture rates at 12-month follow-up. Using World Health Organization criteria, 39.6% had osteopenia (T score of -1 to -2.49) and 7.2% had osteoporosis (T score </=-2.5). Age, personal or family history of fracture, Asian or Hispanic heritage, smoking, and cortisone use were associated with significantly increased likelihood of osteoporosis; higher body mass index, African American heritage, estrogen or diuretic use, exercise, and alcohol consumption significantly decreased the likelihood. Among the 163 979 participants with follow-up information, osteoporosis was associated with a fracture rate approximately 4 times that of normal BMD (rate ratio, 4.03; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.59-4.53) and osteopenia was associated with a 1.8-fold higher rate (95% CI, 1.49-2.18). Almost half of this population had previously undetected low BMD, including 7% with osteoporosis. Peripheral BMD results were highly predictive of fracture risk. Given the economic and social costs of osteoporotic fractures, strategies to identify and manage osteoporosis in the primary care setting need to be established and implemented.","In a prospective observational study of women over 50 years of age, 39.6% had osteopenia and 7.2% had osteoporosis. Osteoporosis was associated with a fracture rate 4 times that of normal bone mineral density."
"What is the best way to evaluate and manage diarrhea in the febrile infant
This article reviews and synthesizes evidence in the published literature on the safety and efficacy of oral rehydration therapy (ORT) among young children with pediatric gastroenteritis in developed nations. We searched the literature for randomized, controlled trials comparing the safety and efficacy of ORT with intravenous (IV) rehydration treatment and/or oral rehydration solutions (ORSs) of different sodium content. We combined the failure rates of each set of studies in statistical meta-analyses and conducted tests of homogeneity of treatment effect over all the studies and for subgroups of children defined by the trial type, the sodium content of the ORS, and the setting of care. We also conducted a multivariate logistic regression on the probability of failure to determine the relative importance of these factors, controlling for other characteristics of the trials. Other outcomes were also tabulated and discussed. These include the relative incidence of hypernatremia and hyponatremia induced by treatment; weight gain; the volume, frequency, and duration of diarrhea; for inpatient trials, the length of stay; and for outpatient trials, rates of hospitalization. The evidence suggests that among pediatric patients with gastroenteritis in developed countries, failure of ORT, defined as the need to rehydrate children intravenously, is infrequent. We found a combined overall ORT failure rate of 3.6%. We found no statistically significant difference in failure rates by trial type or the sodium content of the ORS. However, we did find some supporting evidence for a lower failure rate among children treated in outpatient settings. In addition, compared with patients rehydrated intravenously, pediatric patients treated with ORT were not found to be at higher risk of iatrogenic hypernatremia or hyponatremia. The evidence from the literature fails to show a consistent trend in favor of either high- or low-sodium solutions for rehydration of pediatric patients. There seems to be a great potential for improving the medical treatment of children with acute gastroenteritis by the greater use of ORT.","A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in developed countries demonstrated equivalent efficacy of oral fluids compared with IV fluids, with an overall failure rate of only 3.6% for infants and children treated with oral rehydrating solution (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4-5.8). There was no significant difference between oral rehydrating solution of varying sodium concentrations, and no increased risk of hypernatremia or hyponatremia compared with the IV treatment arm."
"What is the best medical therapy for new-onset type 2 diabetes
In patients with type 2 diabetes, intensive blood-glucose control with insulin or sulphonylurea therapy decreases progression of microvascular disease and may also reduce the risk of heart attacks. This study investigated whether intensive glucose control with metformin has any specific advantage or disadvantage. Of 4075 patients recruited to UKPDS in 15 centres, 1704 overweight (>120% ideal bodyweight) patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes, mean age 53 years, had raised fasting plasma glucose (FPG; 6.1-15.0 mmol/L) without hyperglycaemic symptoms after 3 months' initial diet. 753 were included in a randomised controlled trial, median duration 10.7 years, of conventional policy, primarily with diet alone (n=411) versus intensive blood-glucose control policy with metformin, aiming for FPG below 6 mmol/L (n=342). A secondary analysis compared the 342 patients allocated metformin with 951 overweight patients allocated intensive blood-glucose control with chlorpropamide (n=265), glibenclamide (n=277), or insulin (n=409). The primary outcome measures were aggregates of any diabetes-related clinical endpoint, diabetes-related death, and all-cause mortality. In a supplementary randomised controlled trial, 537 non-overweight and overweight patients, mean age 59 years, who were already on maximum sulphonylurea therapy but had raised FPG (6.1-15.0 mmol/L) were allocated continuing sulphonylurea therapy alone (n=269) or addition of metformin (n=268). Median glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) was 7.4% in the metformin group compared with 8.0% in the conventional group. Patients allocated metformin, compared with the conventional group, had risk reductions of 32% (95% CI 13-47, p=0.002) for any diabetes-related endpoint, 42% for diabetes-related death (9-63, p=0.017), and 36% for all-cause mortality (9-55, p=0.011). Among patients allocated intensive blood-glucose control, metformin showed a greater effect than chlorpropamide, glibenclamide, or insulin for any diabetes-related endpoint (p=0.0034), all-cause mortality (p=0.021), and stroke (p=0.032). Early addition of metformin in sulphonylurea-treated patients was associated with an increased risk of diabetes-related death (96% increased risk [95% CI 2-275], p=0.039) compared with continued sulphonylurea alone. A combined analysis of the main and supplementary studies showed fewer metformin-allocated patients having diabetes-related endpoints (risk reduction 19% [2-33], p=0.033). Epidemiological assessment of the possible association of death from diabetes-related causes with the concurrent therapy of diabetes in 4416 patients did not show an increased risk in diabetes-related death in patients treated with a combination of sulphonylurea and metformin (risk reduction 5% [-33 to 32], p=0.78). Since intensive glucose control with metformin appears to decrease the risk of diabetes-related endpoints in overweight diabetic patients, and is associated with less weight gain and fewer hypoglycaemic attacks than are insulin and sulphonylureas, it may be the first-line pharmacological therapy of choice in these patients.","In 12 trials with 2067 patients, metformin decreased HbA1c more than sulfonylureas did (standardized mean difference [SMD] -0.14; 95% CI, -0.28 to -0.01). In 3 trials with 246 patients, metformin also produced greater HbA1c decreases than thiazolidinediones (SMD -0.28; 95% CI, -0.52 to -0.03). In the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS), metformin improved diabetes-related outcomes and all-cause mortality in obese patients (relative risk of mortality=0.73; 95% CI, 0.55-0.97; P=.03; number needed to treat [NNT]=19)."
"Which blood tests are most helpful in evaluating pelvic inflammatory disease
The objective of the study was to evaluate the test performance of erythrocyte sedimentation rate and serum C-reactive protein in assessing the severity of acute pelvic inflammatory disease and to determine clinically useful cutoff levels to discriminate mild from severe pelvic inflammatory disease. The study population consisted of 72 women with acute pelvic inflammatory disease verified by laparoscopy and endometrial histopathologic studies; 37 patients had mild and 35 had severe pelvic inflammatory disease. Cutoff levels for erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein were determined to reach best sensitivity and specificity to discriminate between severe and mild disease. Clinical and microbiologic data were analyzed by chi 2, or t test. Logistic regression analysis was used to analyze risk factors for severe pelvic inflammatory disease. Patients with severe pelvic inflammatory disease had higher erythrocyte sedimentation rates and C-reactive protein levels than did those with mild disease. In detecting severe disease an erythrocyte sedimentation rate > or = 40 mm/hr and C-reactive protein levels > or = 60 mg/L had a sensitivity of 97%, a specificity of 61%, a negative predictive value of 96%, and a positive predictive value of 70%. All patients with tuboovarian abscess or perihepatitis and six of seven patients who had anaerobic bacteria isolated from the fallopian tubes tested positive with these cutoff levels. Combined use of erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein levels is useful in assessing the severity of acute pelvic inflammatory disease and augments the clinical decision making regarding treatment.","A report looked at the ability of erythrocyte sedimentation rate and c-reactive protein to differentiate between mild, moderate, and severe pelvic inflammatory disease in 72 women undergoing laparoscopy at a university department of gynecology.4 The cutoff levels were erythrocyte sedimentation rate >40 mm/hr and c-reactive protein >60 mg/dL. If either test was abnormal, the sensitivity and the negative predictive value for severe disease were 97% and 96%, respectively. All patients with tuboovarian abscess or perihepatitis and 6 of 7 patients who had anaerobic bacteria isolated from the fallopian tubes tested positive with these cutoff levels."
"When should a child with an undescended testis be referred to a urologist
A prospective hospital-based cohort study was conducted to determine the prevalence rates of cryptorchidism at birth, 3 months, and 1 year of age. A total of 6935 consecutive male neonates delivered at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City between October 1987 and October 1990 were examined at birth for cryptorchidism. Standardized examination and classification criteria were used. Infants classified as cryptorchid at birth were reexamined at 3 months and 1 year after the expected date of delivery. Of 6935 neonates assessed at birth, 255 (3.7%) were found to be cryptorchid at birth. The rates were significantly elevated for low birth weight, preterm, small-for-gestational age, and twin neonates. The overall rate had declined to 1.0% by the 3-month assessment and 1.1% at the 1-year assessment. Although the rates at the 1-year assessment tended to be higher for low birth weight and preterm infants, no significant group differences were observed. Since the prevalence rates in this study are similar to those reported several decades ago, these data provide no evidence that the rate of cryptorchidism has increased either at birth or by 1 year of age. Furthermore, most testes that descend spontaneously do so within the first 3 months after the expected date of delivery.","A study followed 6935 infant boys, finding cryptorchidism at birth in 3.7%, which decreased to 1% at 3 months and remained unchanged at 1 year."
"What medication best prevents migraine in children
Successful migraine prophylaxis with flunarizine has been reported in adults by several authors. We used flunarizine in a double-blind, placebo controlled, randomized trial in childhood migraine. Twenty-four children with classical or common migraine were followed by a 12-week flunarizine treatment period. Each patient took 5 mg/day of the drug before going to sleep. Twenty-four children with similar clinical characteristics were assigned to placebo treatment. Efficacy of flunarizine versus placebo was assessed on the basis of the reduction of headache frequency and duration. A statistical comparison was performed between values reported in the treatment period and those in the three months before. Children treated with flunarizine experienced a statistically significant reduction in headache (66%) and duration (51%). These results were statistically superior to those observed in the placebo group. Sixteen patients on flunarizine therapy experienced an improvement of more than 50% of both parameters. We found flunarizine is an effective agent in children's migraine prophylaxis. Moreover it is suitable for the low incidence of mild side effects.","In a double-blinded, placebo-controlled randomized controlled trial of 48 children, flunarizine decreased mean headache frequency (3.0 attacks/3 months vs 6.5 [P<.001])."
"How should patients with mitral regurgitation be followed
Mitral regurgitation due to flail leaflet is difficult to manage, because it is frequently asymptomatic yet carries a high risk of left ventricular dysfunction and because the natural history of the condition is poorly defined. We obtained clinical follow-up data through 1994-1995 in 229 patients with isolated mitral regurgitation due to flail leaflet; this condition was first diagnosed by echocardiography between 1980 and 1989. The 86 patients who were treated medically had a mortality rate significantly higher than expected (6.3 percent yearly, P=0.016 for the comparison with the expected rate in the U.S. population according to the 1990 census). Independent determinants of mortality were an older age, the presence of symptoms, and a lower ejection fraction. Patients who were even transiently in New York Heart Association functional class III or IV had a high mortality rate (34 percent yearly), but the rate was also notable (4.1 percent yearly) among those in class I or II. At 10 years, the mean (+/- SE) rates of heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and death or surgery were 63 +/- 8, 30 +/- 12, and 90 +/- 3 percent, respectively. In a multivariate analysis, surgical correction of mitral regurgitation (performed in 143 patients) was associated with a reduced mortality rate (hazard ratio, 0.29; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.15 to 0.56; P<0.001). When treated medically, mitral regurgitation due to flail leaflet is associated with excess mortality and high morbidity. Surgery is almost unavoidable within 10 years after the diagnosis and appears to be associated with an improved prognosis; this finding suggests that surgery should be considered early in the course of the disease.","A well-done, prospective cohort study enrolled 229 patients (mean age, 66; 70% male) diagnosed with severe mitral regurgitation. Overall 10-year mortality was 43%. Older patients, those with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III or IV heart failure, or those with left ventricular ejection fraction <60% had higher mortality. Eighty-two percent of patients had surgery within 10 years. Mortality among patients undergoing surgery was equivalent to that of the age-matched US population and significantly less than patients managed without surgery."
"Is therapy based on endoscopy results better than empiric therapy for dyspepsia
Dyspepsia is a chronic disease with significant impact on the use of health care resources. A management strategy based on Helicobacter pylori testing has been recommended but the long term effect is unknown. To investigate the long term effect of a test and treat strategy compared with prompt endoscopy for management of dyspeptic patients in primary care. A total of 500 patients presenting in primary care with dyspepsia were randomised to management by H pylori testing plus eradication therapy (n = 250) or by endoscopy (n = 250). Results of 12 month follow up have previously been presented. Symptoms, quality of life, and patient satisfaction were recorded during a three month period, a median 6.7 years after randomisation (range 6.1-7.3 years). Number of endoscopies, antisecretory medication, H pylori treatments, and hospital visits were recorded from health care databases for the entire follow up period. Median age was 45 years; 28% were H pylori infected. Use of resources was registered in all 500 patients (3084 person years) of whom 312 completed diaries. We found no difference in symptoms between the two groups. Median proportion of days without symptoms was 0.52 (interquartile range 0.10-0.88) in the test and eradicate group versus 0.64 (0.14-0.90) in the prompt endoscopy group (p = 0.27) (mean difference 0.05 (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.03 to 0.14)). Compared with the prompt endoscopy group, the test and eradicate group underwent fewer endoscopies (mean difference 0.62 endoscopies/person (95% CI 0.38-0.86)) and used less antisecretory medication (mean difference 102 defined daily doses/person (95% CI -1 to 205)). On a long term basis, a H pylori test and eradicate strategy is as efficient as prompt endoscopy for management of dyspeptic patients in primary care and reduces the use of endoscopy and antisecretory medication.","A subgroup analysis of 4 trials from the Cochrane review (1 from primary care) demonstrated a significant reduction of the number of endoscopies among patients receiving ""test and treat"" care vs those receiving early endoscopy (RR=0.23; 95% CI, 0.12-0.44). In the long-term follow-up study, fewer antisecretory medication prescriptions were needed by those patients in the ""test and treat"" group (P=.047)."
"For knee pain, how predictive is physical examination for meniscal injury
Clinicians frequently use the results of clinical diagnostic tests to make decisions concerning patients. The intent of this paper is to review the technical aspects and measurement properties of the McMurray test and, more globally, to illustrate the impact that indiscriminate test application has on test interpretation. The literature shows that diagnostic accuracy studies, which evaluate the test described by McMurray, yield remarkably similar estimates of sensitivity (about 26%) and specificity (about 94%). These test characteristics are applied to three case scenarios to illustrate the impact that history-specific prevalence (i.e., the likelihood a patient has the condition based on the history) has on the predictive values. The results show a high false positive rate when applied to patients who, based on the history, have a low pre-physical examination likelihood for the condition of interest and a higher false negative rate when applied to patients who have a high history-specific prevalence. Readers are warned that the exhaustive examination approach effectively lowers the prevalence and results in a high false positive rate. The impact that the exhaustive approach has on increasing the false positive rate is universal to all diagnostic investigations and is not unique to the McMurray test.","Authors of all meta-analyses noted the lack of standardization in physical examination maneuvers (especially the McMurray test) and, in some cases, no specification of how physical examination tests were performed.

"Does warfarin prevent deep venous thrombosis in high-risk patients
Patients who have a first episode of venous thromboembolism in the absence of known risk factors for thrombosis (idiopathic thrombosis) are often treated with anticoagulant therapy for three months. Such patients may benefit from longer treatment, however, because they appear to have an increased risk of recurrence after anticoagulant therapy is stopped. In this double-blind study, we randomly assigned patients who had completed 3 months of anticoagulant therapy for a first episode of idiopathic venous thromboembolism to continue receiving warfarin, with the dose adjusted to achieve an international normalized ratio of 2.0 to 3.0, or to receive placebo for a further 24 months. Our goal was to determine the effects of extended anticoagulant therapy on rates of recurrent symptomatic venous thromboembolism and bleeding. A prespecified interim analysis of efficacy led to the early termination of the trial after 162 patients had been enrolled and followed for an average of 10 months. Of 83 patients assigned to continue to receive placebo, 17 had a recurrent episode of venous thromboembolism (27.4 percent per patient-year), as compared with 1 of 79 patients assigned to receive warfarin (1.3 percent per patient-year, P<0.001). Warfarin resulted in a 95 percent reduction in the risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism (95 percent confidence interval, 63 to 99 percent). Three patients assigned to the warfarin group had nonfatal major bleeding (two had gastrointestinal bleeding and one genitourinary bleeding), as compared with none of those assigned to the placebo group (3.8 vs. 0 percent per patient-year, P=0.09). Patients with a first episode of idiopathic venous thromboembolism should be treated with anticoagulant agents for longer than three months.","A multicenter randomized controlled trial found extending warfarin treatment for 12 months vs 3 months resulted in a 95% relative risk reduction relative risk reduction in risk of deep venous thrombosis recurrence 95% CI, 63-99; NNT=5."
"What is the best way to treat patients with white-coat hypertension
The objective of this paper was to evaluate the cardiovascular risk in white coat hypertension (WCH). WCH is a well-known clinical entity defined by persistently elevated blood pressure (BP) in the doctor's office, whereas BP in other conditions is normal. The prognosis of WCH is unsettled, although two prospective studies that include normal control groups imply that the condition is benign. This study is a 10-year follow-up study on 420 patients with grade I-II hypertension newly diagnosed by their general practitioner and 146 normal controls (NTs). Ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) monitoring was performed at baseline. With our protocollated cutoff value of daytime-ABP <135/90 mmHg, 76 (18.1%) of the 420 hypertensives were white coat hypertensives (WCHs) and 344 were established hypertensives (EHs). With a lower cutoff of 135/85 mmHg, 40 (9.5%) were WCHs. Complete follow-up data were obtained for all 566 subjects. The mean duration of follow-up was 10.2 years (range 9.0-12.5). In the WCH group, 14 first events were recorded (18.4%) consisting of two cardiovascular deaths and 12 nonfatal cardiovascular events. In the EH group, the corresponding number of events were 56 first events (16.3%), 12 cardiovascular deaths and 44 nonfatal cardiovascular events, and in the NT group 10 first events (6.8%), two cardiovascular deaths and eight nonfatal cardiovascular events. The event rate was similar in the WCH group and the EH group and significantly lower in the NT group (P<0.05). When corrected for daytime-ABP, age and other confounders, the difference remained statistically significant. When using the lower cutoff of 135/85 mmHg, WCH was still associated with a significantly higher cardiovascular event rate. In conclusion, the main finding of this 10-year follow-up study is an increased cardiovascular risk in WCH compared to normotensive controls.","A recent 10-year longitudinal study of 146 normotensive people, 76 people with white-coat hypertension, and 344 with sustained hypertension showed that cardiovascular event rates were similar for patients with white-coat and sustained hypertension, and were significantly higher than in the normotensive group (P=.03 overall, P=.03 between white-coat hypertension and normotension and P=.01 between sustained hypertension and normotension)."
"What is the recommended workup for a man with a first urinary tract infection
To compare ultrasonography and abdominal radiography with intravenous urography in the investigation of urinary tract infection in men. Prospective study in two hospital departments. Radiological procedures and urological assessments performed on different days by different clinicians District general hospital. Consecutive series of men (n=114) referred to the department of urology for investigation of proved urinary tract infection. Ultrasonography and intravenous urography of renal tract and assessment of urinary flow rate. Clinical assessment, cystoscopy, urodynamic studies, and transrectal ultrasonography with biopsy. Sensitivity and specificity of ultrasonography and abdominal radiography compared with intravenous urography. Important abnormalities were seen in 53 of 100 fully evaluated patients, the most common being a poorly emptying bladder (34). The combination of plain radiographs of kidneys, ureter, and bladder and ultrasonography detected more abnormalities than intravenous urography alone. No important abnormality was missed by this combination (sensitivity 100% and specificity 93%). Ultrasonography with abdominal radiography is as accurate as intravenous urography in detecting important urological abnormalities in men presenting with urinary tract infection. This combination is safer than intravenous urography and should be the initial investigation for such patients. Additional determination of urinary flow rate is useful for the assessment of an incompletely emptying bladder.","Another study enrolled 114 men, 18 to 85 years of age, with proven UTIs, who underwent ultrasonography and plain radiography, as well as an IVP. (Only 100 had complete data at enrollment.) All men had urinary flow rates measured. The combination of a plain abdominal film and ultrasonography detected more abnormalities than an IVP. (The primary role of the plain film was in detecting urinary calculi.) Final ""clinical"" diagnoses were reported, but the study did not report a comparison of clinical and radiological findings. Almost half of the abnormalities were lower tract obstructions (bladder outlet obstruction, underactive detrusor, and chronic retention). There was no comment on the importance or treatment of any abnormalities found."
"What is the best strategy for impaired glucose tolerance in nonpregnant adults
Type 2 diabetes mellitus is increasingly common, primarily because of increases in the prevalence of a sedentary lifestyle and obesity. Whether type 2 diabetes can be prevented by interventions that affect the lifestyles of subjects at high risk for the disease is not known. We randomly assigned 522 middle-aged, overweight subjects (172 men and 350 women; mean age, 55 years; mean body-mass index [weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters], 31) with impaired glucose tolerance to either the intervention group or the control group. Each subject in the intervention group received individualized counseling aimed at reducing weight, total intake of fat, and intake of saturated fat and increasing intake of fiber and physical activity. An oral glucose-tolerance test was performed annually; the diagnosis of diabetes was confirmed by a second test. The mean duration of follow-up was 3.2 years. The mean (+/-SD) amount of weight lost between base line and the end of year 1 was 4.2+/-5.1 kg in the intervention group and 0.8+/-3.7 kg in the control group; the net loss by the end of year 2 was 3.5+/-5.5 kg in the intervention group and 0.8+/-4.4 kg in the control group (P<0.001 for both comparisons between the groups). The cumulative incidence of diabetes after four years was 11 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 6 to 15 percent) in the intervention group and 23 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 17 to 29 percent) in the control group. During the trial, the risk of diabetes was reduced by 58 percent (P<0.001) in the intervention group. The reduction in the incidence of diabetes was directly associated with changes in lifestyle. Type 2 diabetes can be prevented by changes in the lifestyles of high-risk subjects.","In the Finnish Diabetes Prevention Study, the lifestyle intervention group had a 12.5% absolute risk reduction compared with the control group (NNT=8). Successful lifestyle interventions included weight loss of 5% to 7%, decreased fat intake, increased fiber intake, and 150 minutes of exercise per week."
"When should we stop mammography screening for breast cancer in elderly women
Screening mammography is effective in reducing breast cancer mortality in women between the ages of 50 and 69 years. We sought to determine whether older women who undergo screening mammography have a decreased risk of metastatic breast cancer. We studied 690,993 women aged 66 to 79 years who were California Medicare beneficiaries from January 1992 to December 1993, and who chose the fee-for-service plan. Health Care Financing Administration part B billing records were used to determine the use of screening mammography. The extent of breast cancer (in situ, local, regional, or metastatic) was ascertained for the 6,767 women who were diagnosed with the disease in 1993, using data from the California State Cancer Registry. For each type (extent) of breast cancer, the relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence (CI) of developing breast cancer was estimated by dividing the risk of its development in screened women by the risk in women who were not screened. A total of 46% of women had mammography during the 2-year study period. In situ, local, and regional breast cancer were more likely to be detected among women who underwent screening mammography. For example, the relative risk of detecting local breast cancer in screened women was 3.3 (95% CI: 3.1 to 3.5). The risk of detecting metastatic breast cancer, on the other hand, was significantly reduced among women aged 66 to 79 years who underwent screening mammography (RR = 0.57, 95% CI: 0.45 to 0.72). Screening mammography is associated with a decreased risk of detecting metastatic breast cancer among elderly women. Public health recommendations need to weigh the benefit of screening elderly women against the cost and potential harm from screening and treating early lesions that may have no effect on mortality.","A retrospective cohort study studied studied 690,000 Medicare beneficiaries in California and found a 43% reduction in the risk of metastatic breast cancer in the screened group. A 13-year Dutch study found a 20% breast cancer mortality reduction that first appeared 7 years after initiating screening. The cohorts were not randomly assigned in either study, leading to possible differences in baseline risk."
"What is the best surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma in chronic carriers of hepatitis B
To prospectively determine the prevalence and annual incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma in hepatitis B carriers in a heterogeneous urban North American population and to assess the diagnostic accuracy of tests used for screening for this cancer. Prospective cohort study of 1,069 chronic carriers of hepatitis B virus using screening with alpha-fetoprotein alone or in combination with ultrasonography every 6 months. The mean age of the cohort was 39 +/- 12 years (+/- SD), 65% were men, 71% were Asians. At the first screening visit, serum alpha-fetoprotein was > or = 20 micrograms/L in 4%. In those subjects who were also screened by ultrasonography during the first visit, 9% were found to have focal lesions. Only 3 subjects were found to have hepatocellular carcinoma at the first screening, giving a prevalence of 281/100,000 chronic carriers of hepatitis B virus. The cohort was followed for 2,340 person-years (mean, 26 months follow-up, with a range from 6 to 60 months). During this period, 11 more subjects, 10 men and 1 woman, were diagnosed to have hepatocellular carcinoma (annual incidence, 470/100,000). In men only, the annual incidence was 657/100,000. During the study, 5 subjects died from hepatocellular carcinoma (annual mortality rate, 214/100,000). Sensitivity and specificity of serum alpha-fetoprotein > 20 micrograms/L were 64.3% and 91.4%, respectively. For ultrasonography, sensitivity was 78.8% and specificity 93.8%. These data suggest that the incidence and prevalence of hepatocellular carcinoma in hepatitis B carriers in our area, an urban North American setting, are as high as in countries where hepatitis B is endemic. Current screening tests have significant false-positive and false-negative rates raising questions about the cost-benefit of screening for hepatocellular carcinoma in our study population.","Another randomized control trial took place in Toronto, and included 1069 patients, 71% of whom were of Asian ancestry. Subjects had alpha-fetoprotein testing every 6 months, and half were randomly assigned to have US performed every 6 months. Eight of the 11 incident tumors would have been diagnosed based on alpha-fetoprotein levels alone, and 3 would have been missed with US alone. The authors conclude that for AFP, sensitivity=64.3% and specificity=91.4%; for US, sensitivity=78.8% and specificity=93.8%. However, their study was too small to determine if AFP/US is superior to alpha-fetoprotein for hepatocellular carcinoma screening in a HBsAg+ population. They estimate that detecting such a difference would take a sample size of 10,000 or more."
"How soon should serum potassium levels be monitored for patients started on diuretics
Thirty-five patients with mild hypertension (WHO Class I) participated in a double-blind cross-over study involving two 8-week periods of treatment with cilazapril 2.5-5 mg once daily or hydrochlorothiazide 25-50 mg once daily, in each case preceded by a 4-week placebo period. Thirty-two patients completed the study, the aim of which was to compare the effects of the drugs on serum electrolyte levels, left ventricular mass and cardiac arrhythmias, as assessed by echocardiography and 48-h Holter monitoring. Both drugs significantly reduced systolic (P < 0.01) and diastolic (P < 0.001) blood pressures (comparisons with placebo periods). Cilazapril and hydrochlorothiazide had opposite effects on ventricular ectopic activity. The beneficial effect of cilazapril on ventricular extrasystole counts correlated significantly (P < 0.001) with the reduction of left ventricular mass index. Hydrochlorothiazide had no effects on left ventricular mass or diastolic function. Serum potassium values were significantly (P < 0.001) reduced by hydrochlorothiazide but there was no correlation between changes in potassium levels and changes in ventricular ectopic activity. The results of the study suggest that hydrochlorothiazide and cilazapril were equally effective in reducing blood pressure, but only cilazapril reduced left ventricular hypertrophy and suppressed ventricular ectopic activity.",Recent studies have found that hydrochlorothiazide in doses above 12.5 to 25 mg do not result in significantly lower blood pressure and only lead to more electrolyte abnormalities.
"What is the appropriate use of sunscreen for infants and children
Six-hundred-and-three people aged 40 or more years, from Maryborough in central Victoria, were enrolled in a randomized longitudinal study, which required daily application of either a SPF 15+, broad-spectrum, water-resistant sunscreen cream or the cream base without the active ingredients. The study duration was 7 months, from September 1991 until April 1992. One-hundred-and-fourteen (18.9%) of these subjects developed an adverse reaction to the cream they were applying. Patch testing, photopatch testing and scratch testing with the ingredients of the creams revealed that only a small proportion (< 10%) of the inflammatory eruptions were allergic in nature. None of the people tested was allergic to the sunscreen active ingredients. History and examination findings, where available, suggested that the majority of adverse responses were consistent with an irritant reaction, both to the sunscreen preparation and the base cream control. A higher than expected proportion of the people who developed an adverse reaction had a personal history consistent with atopy. Other reactions included acneiform eruptions and contact urticaria. A frequency of reactions to sunscreen preparations of over 15% means that further work is necessary to improve both the formulation of such products, and the manner and conditions under which they are used, to ensure satisfactory compliance.","A randomized controlled trials of 603 adults found no allergic reactions to active sunscreen ingredients, though 19% of subjects had an irritant reaction or allergy to the base compounds."
"What is the best way to treat tinea cruris
Fungal infections of the feet normally occur in the outermost layer of the skin (epidermis). The skin between the toes is a frequent site of infection which can cause pain and itchiness. Fungal infections of the nail (onychomycosis) can affect the entire nail plate. To assess the effects of topical treatments in successfully treating (rate of treatment failure) fungal infections of the skin of the feet and toenails and in preventing recurrence. We searched the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register (January 2005), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2005), MEDLINE and EMBASE (from inception to January 2005). We screened the Science Citation Index, BIOSIS, CAB - Health and Healthstar, CINAHL DARE, NHS Economic Evaluation Database and EconLit (March 2005). Bibliographies were searched. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) using participants who had mycologically diagnosed fungal infections of the skin and nails of the foot. Two authors independently summarised the included trials and appraised their quality of reporting using a structured data extraction tool. Of the 144 identified papers, 67 trials met the inclusion criteria. Placebo-controlled trials yielded the following pooled risk ratios (RR) of treatment failure for skin infections: allylamines RR 0.33 (95% CI 0.24 to 0.44); azoles RR 0.30 (95% CI 0.20 to 0.45); ciclopiroxolamine RR 0.27 (95% CI 0.11 to 0.66); tolnaftate RR 0.19 (95% CI 0.08 to 0.44); butenafine RR 0.33 (95% CI 0.24 to 0.45); undecanoates RR 0.29 (95% CI 0.12 - 0.70). Meta-analysis of 11 trials comparing allylamines and azoles showed a risk ratio of treatment failure RR 0.63 (95% CI 0.42 to 0.94) in favour of allylamines. Evidence for the management of topical treatments for infections of the toenails is sparser. There is some evidence that ciclopiroxolamine and butenafine are both effective but they both need to be applied daily for prolonged periods (at least 1 year). The 6 trials of nail infections provided evidence that topical ciclopiroxolamine has poor cure rates and that amorolfine might be substantially more effective but more research is required. Placebo-controlled trials of allylamines and azoles for athlete's foot consistently produce much higher percentages of cure than placebo. Allylamines cure slightly more infections than azoles and are now available OTC. Further research into the effectiveness of antifungal agents for nail infections is required.","A systematic review on tinea pedis topical therapy acknowledges the higher cure rates by allylamines, compared with azoles, but concludes that azoles remain the most costeffective in the treatment of tinea pedis."
"Should you evaluate for coronary artery disease in seniors with premature ventricular contractions
Increased ventricular ectopic activity and even more complex arrhythmias are not uncommon in subjects without apparent heart disease. However, their prognostic significance has been controversial and not updated in recent years. The prevalence and prognostic significance of different ventricular arrhythmias were studied in a cohort of middle-aged and elderly subjects without apparent heart disease. Six hundred seventy-eight men and women aged 55 to 75 years without a history of heart disease or stroke were included. Baseline examinations included physical examinations, fasting laboratory testing, and 48-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring. All patients were followed for up to 5 years. Combined events were defined as all-cause mortality or acute myocardial infarction. A cardiovascular event was defined as cardiovascular death or acute myocardial infarction. In total, 84% had 0 to 10 ventricular premature complexes (VPCs)/hour, 8% had 11 to 30 VPCs/hour, and 8% had >30 VPCs/hour; 10.8% had >or=1 run of >or=3 VPCs. Frequent VPCs (>or=30/hour) was a significant predictor of combined (hazard ratio 2.47, 95% confidence interval 1.29 to 4.68, p = 0.006) and cardiovascular (hazard ratio 2.85, 95% confidence interval 1.16 to 7.0, p = 0.023) event rates, after adjustment for conventional risk factors. Runs of >or=4 VPCs/day or >or=2 doublets/day were also associated with a poor prognosis, but only in the presence of frequent VPCs. The detection of a single VPC on standard electrocardiography was a significant predictor of frequent VPCs and an independent predictor of events (hazard ratio 2.6, 95% confidence interval 1.02 to 6.66, p = 0.045). In conclusion, apparently healthy, middle-aged and elderly subjects with frequent VPCs (>or=30/hour) have a poor prognosis. According to current guidelines, strict risk-factor modification and primary prevention are justified in these high-risk subjects.","The Copenhagen Holter study of a cohort of healthy patients demonstrated an increased risk of myocardial infarction or cardiovascular death in patients with >30 PVCs per hour (hazard ratio [HR]=2.85, 95% CI, 1.16-7.0)."
"Which imaging modality is best for suspected stroke
To determine the cost-effectiveness of computed tomographic (CT) scanning after acute stroke. To assess the contribution of brain imaging to the diagnosis and management of stroke, and to estimate the costs, benefits and risks of different imaging strategies in order to provide data to inform national and local policy on the use of brain imaging in stroke. A decision-analysis model was developed to represent the pathway of care in acute stroke using 'scan all patients within 48 hours' as the comparator against which to cost 12 alternative scan strategies. Hospitals in Scotland. Subjects were patients admitted to hospital with a first stroke and those managed as outpatients. The effect on functional outcome after ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke, tumours or infections, of correctly administered antithrombotic or other treatment; of time to scan and stroke severity on diagnosis by CT or MRI; on management, including length of stay, functional outcome, and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), of the diagnostic information provided by CT scanning; the cost-effectiveness (cost versus QALYs) of different strategies for use of CT after acute stroke. Death and functional outcome at long-term follow-up; accuracy of CT and MRI; cost of CT scanning by time of day and week; effect of CT diagnosis on change in health outcome, length of stay in hospital and QALYs; cost-effectiveness of various scanning strategies. CT is very sensitive and specific for haemorrhage within the first 8 days of stroke only. Suboptimal scanning used in epidemiology studies suggests that the frequency of primary intracerebral haemorrhage (PICH) has been underestimated. Aspirin increases the risk of PICH. There were no reliable data on functional outcome or on the effect of antithrombotic treatment given long term after PICH. In 60% of patients with recurrent stroke after PICH, the cause is another PICH and mortality is high among PICH patients. A specific MR sequence (gradient echo) is required to identify prior PICH reliably. CT scanners were distributed unevenly in Scotland, 65% provided CT scanning within 48 hours of stroke, and 100% within 7 days for hospital-admitted patients, but access out of hours was very variable, and for outpatients was poor. The average cost of a CT brain scan for stroke was pounds 30.23 to pounds 89.56 in normal working hours and pounds 55.05 to pounds 173.46 out of hours. Average length of stay was greatest for severe strokes and those who survived in a dependent state. For a cohort of 1000 patients aged 70-74 years, the policy 'scan all strokes within 48 hours', cost pounds 10,279,728 and achieved 1982.3 QALYS. The most cost-effective strategy was 'scan all immediately' (pounds 9,993,676 and 1982.4 QALYS). The least cost-effective was to 'scan patients on anticoagulants, in a life-threatening condition immediately and the rest within 14 days'. In general, strategies in which most patients were scanned immediately cost least and achieved the most QALYs, as the cost of providing CT (even out of hours) was less than the cost of inpatient care. Increasing independent survival by even a small proportion through early use of aspirin in the majority with ischaemic stroke, avoiding aspirin in those with haemorrhagic stroke, and appropriate early management of those who have not had a stroke, reduced costs and increased QALYs.","A prospective cohort study comparing imaging modalities in the acute time frame has been published. The study enrolled 129 patients with stroke symptoms of less than 3 hours, as well as 71 patients with between 3 and 6 hours of symptoms. Patients underwent multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (including gradient recalled echo and diffusion-weighted imaging) and noncontrast computerized tomography within 90 minutes of presentation. Two stroke specialists and 2 neuroradiologists, masked to clinical information, read the scans independently at a later date. Interrater reliability was good (= 0.75-0.94) for identifying acute hemorrhage. There was 96% concordance between the magnetic resonance imaging and computerized tomography interpretations. The 4 hemorrhages ""missed"" by computerized tomography were hemorrhagic transformations of acute infarct, and the 4 hemorrhages ""missed"" by magnetic resonance imaging were misclassified as chronic when they were acute. The clinical implications of this study are uncertain. Without recognition of 1 imaging modality as the reference standard, it is difficult to say whether a hemorrhage ""missed"" on computerized tomography was a false negative on computerized tomography or a false positive on MRI."
"Does heat or cold work better for acute muscle strain
Cryotherapy is the treatment of choice in the management of acute athletic injuries. Ice is readily available and simple to apply. The rationale for its use is based on well-defined physiologic observations. The application of heat is not indicated in the immediate treatment of acute athletic injuries. If applied early and injudiciously, heat may adversely affect resolution of the trauma and prolong the rehabilitation of the athlete.","Cryotherapy has been the recommended initial treatment for muscle strain for more than 30 years, based generally on expert opinion and physiological models, not clinical trials. Theoretically, cryotherapy controls hemorrhage and tissue edema, whereas heat enhances the inflammatory response."
"Does a low-salt diet reduce morbidity and mortality in congestive heart failure
Despite major advances in the pharmacotherapy of heart failure, hospitalization rates remain high, owing in large part to a multitude of psychosocial, behavioral, and financial factors that serve as barriers to effective compliance with prescribed treatment. To deal with these issues, many centers have adopted a multidisciplinary approach to heart failure disease management. A systematic review of the literature was conducted using the Medline database supplemented by reference lists from published articles. From 1983 to 1998, 16 studies describing multidisciplinary heart failure disease management programs were published in the English language literature. Of these, 10 were nonrandomized, observational studies and 6 were randomized clinical trials. All studies reported significant benefits in terms of reducing hospital utilization, and several studies reported improved quality of life, functional capacity, patient satisfaction, and compliance with diet and medications. In all studies in which a cost analysis was performed, heart failure disease management programs were found to be cost-effective. The limitations of the current data include concerns about the generalizability of published findings to the large and heterogenous population of patients with heart failure in the community, the feasibility of translating specific disease management programs into diverse practice environments, uncertainty about how to design and implement a maximally cost-effective heart failure disease management strategy, and how to best tailor the treatment program to the needs of each individual patient. The impact of heart failure disease management programs on survival is also unknown. Based on currently available data, heart failure disease management programs appear to be a cost-effective approach to reducing morbidity and enhancing quality of life in selected patients with heart failure. However, additional study is needed involving larger and more diverse populations to define the optimal approach to heart failure disease management.","A systematic review of 6 RCTs showed that multidisciplinary heart failure disease management programs, which emphasized dietary counseling and/or sodium intake reduction, improved functional capacity, patient satisfaction, and quality of life."
"Which patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) should have esophagogastroduoudenoscopy (EGD)
The incidence of esophageal and gastric cardia adenocarcinoma is, for unknown reasons, increasing dramatically. A weak and inconsistent association between body mass index (BMI) and adenocarcinoma of the esophagus and gastric cardia has been reported. To reexamine the association between BMI and development of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus and gastric cardia. Nationwide, population-based case-control study. Sweden, 1995 through 1997. Patients younger than 80 years of age who had recently received a diagnosis were eligible. Comprehensive organization ensured rapid case ascertainment. Controls were randomly selected from the continuously updated population register. Interviews were conducted with 189 patients with adenocarcinoma of the esophagus and 262 patients with adenocarcinoma of the gastric cardia; for comparison, 167 patients with incident esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma and 820 controls were also interviewed. Odds ratios were determined from BMI and cancer case-control status. Odds ratios estimated the relative risk for the two adenocarcinomas studied and were calculated by multivariate logistic regression with adjustment for potential confounding factors. A strong dose-dependent relation existed between BMI and esophageal adenocarcinoma. The adjusted odds ratio was 7.6 (95% CI, 3.8 to 15.2) among persons in the highest BMI quartile compared with persons in the lowest. Obese persons (persons with a BMI > 30 kg/m2) had an odds ratio of 16.2 (CI, 6.3 to 41.4) compared with the leanest persons (persons with a BMI < 22 kg/m2). The odds ratio for patients with cardia adenocarcinoma was 2.3 (CI, 1.5 to 3.6) in those in the highest BMI quartile compared with those in the lowest BMI quartile and 4.3 (CI, 2.1 to 8.7) among obese persons. Esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma was not associated with BMI. The association between BMI and esophageal adenocarcinoma is strong and is not explained by bias or confounding. The carcinogenic mechanism, however, remains to be clarified. The increasing prevalence of obesity in western countries could be important in understanding the increasing occurrence of this tumor.","Obesity was a risk factor for esophageal adenocarcinoma in this population. Patients with a body mass index (BMI) greater than 30 had increased risk of adenocarcinoma compared with patients with a body mass index less than 25 (OR=16.2; 95% CI, 6.3-41.4). These authors calculated numbers of endoscopies needed to detect 1 case of esophageal adenocarcinoma."
"How should we follow athletes after a concussion
We sought to determine the duration of cognitive impairment after sports concussion. We conducted a study with a prospective design in which 729 athletes underwent preseason baseline testing by being administered a computerized neuropsychological test battery, followed by retesting at regular intervals after they sustained sports-related concussions. A control group consisting of nonconcussed athletes drawn from the same baseline population underwent testing at parallel intervals. Cognitive impairment in this primarily American Academy of Neurology Grade II sample of boxing concussions was apparent on the day of injury and at 1 to 2 days postinjury. Recovery of cognitive performance occurred during the 3- to 7-day interval. Comparison with control subjects showed that absent or attenuated practice effects, in addition to frank deterioration from baseline, were indications of recent concussion. The present findings of recovery during the 3- to 7-day interval postinjury are consistent with the American Academy of Neurology Grade II return-to-play practice parameters suggesting a 1-week time-out from participation in contact sports.",A prospective cohort study of boxers at the US Military Academy found that it takes 3 to 7 days for recovery of neurocognitive function
"Do any folk remedies or herbals help induce labor
Many women consume the raspberry leaf herb during their pregnancies in the belief that it shortens labor and makes labor ""easier."" Because of the paucity of research regarding this herb, particularly in relation to pregnancy and birth, the authors undertook a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. The sample consisted of 192 low-risk, nulliparous women who birthed their babies between May 1999 and February 2000 at a large tertiary-level hospital in Sydney, Australia. The aim of the study was to identify the effect and safety of raspberry leaf tablets (2 x 1.2 g per day), consumed from 32 weeks' gestation until labor, on labor and birth outcomes. Raspberry leaf, consumed in tablet form, was found to cause no adverse effects for mother or baby, but contrary to popular belief, did not shorten the first stage of labor. The only clinically significant findings were a shortening of the second stage of labor (mean difference = 9.59 minutes) and a lower rate of forceps deliveries between the treatment group and the control group (19.3% vs. 30.4%). No significant relationship was found between tablet consumption and birth outcomes. The lack of significant differences between the groups on measures expected to demonstrate the effect of raspberry leaf ingestion during pregnancy on labor prompted consideration of the issue of effectiveness of dosage level. Suggestions for further research are offered.",A prospective controlled trial that randomized 192 women to receive either red raspberry leaf tablets (1.2 g twice daily beginning at 32 weeks) or placebo found no significant differences in duration of the first stage of labor or birth outcomes. Symptom surveys of 108 women revealed no adverse effects.
"What vitamins and minerals should be given to breastfed and bottle-fed infants
The aim of this study is to evaluate the iron nutritional status of infants breast-fed exclusively and for a prolonged period in relation to their growth rate and dietary changes. Forty subjects (25 breast-fed; 15 formula-fed) were studied from 0 to 9 months of age. Milk (human or formula) was the only source of food during the first 6 months. From the sixth month onward mothers were instructed to use iron- and ascorbic acid-rich foods to supplement breast-feeding. At the ninth month, prevalence of anemia was 27.8% in the breast-fed group and 7.1% in the formula-fed group. Storage iron was absent in 27.8% of the breast-fed infants vs none of the formula-fed infants. These findings reinforce the recommendation that breast-fed infants be given supplemental iron from the fourth month of life.","The iron status of exclusively breastfed infants vs formula-fed infants was evaluated in a nonrandomized cohort study. Twenty-five healthy, breastfed infants and 15 healthy infants fed high-iron formula were followed for 9 months. No differences in mean hemoglobin values were seen at any age between the 2 groups."
"What are the treatment options for SSRI-related sexual dysfunction
The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether weekend drug holidays would improve sexual functioning in recovered depressed patients with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)-induced sexual dysfunction. Thirty outpatients who reported worsening of sexual functioning during SSRI treatment were instructed to discontinue their SSRIs after the Thursday morning dose and to restart the SSRIs (at their previous dosage) on Sunday at 12:00 noon for four weekends. Significant improvement in sexual functioning was reported by the patients taking sertraline and paroxetine but not by those taking fluoxetine. There were no statistically significant increases in mean Hamilton depression scores after discontinuation of the SSRIs; two patients had increases in scores from the 4-8 range to the 10-14 range. For some patients taking sertraline and paroxetine who experience sexual dysfunction side effects, brief drug holidays may allow for significant improvement in sexual functioning without a significant return of depressive symptoms.","One open-label nonrandomized study of weekend ""drug holidays"" showed no benefit for fluoxetine and inconsistent results for paroxetine and sertraline."
"How beneficial are thiazolidinediones for diabetes mellitus
Care of patients with type 2 diabetes has been revolutionized throughout the past several years-first, by the realization of the importance of tight glycemic control in forestalling complications, and second, by the availability of several unique classes of oral antidiabetic agents. Deciphering which agent to use in certain clinical situations is a new dilemma facing the primary care physician. To systematically review available data from the literature regarding the efficacy of oral antidiabetic agents, both as monotherapy and in combination. A MEDLINE search was performed to identify all English-language reports of unique, randomized controlled clinical trials involving recently available oral agents for type 2 diabetes. Bibliographies were also reviewed to find additional reports not otherwise identified. Studies (63) were included in the analysis if they had a study period of at least 3 months; if each group contained at least 10 subjects at the study's conclusion; and if hemoglobin A(1c) was reported. When multiple dosages of a drug were tested, the results of the highest approved dosage were used. In placebo-controlled trials, hemoglobin A(1c) data are presented as the difference between the change in treated vs placebo subjects. Five distinct oral drug classes are now available for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Compared with placebo treatment, most of these agents lower hemoglobin A(1c) levels approximately 1% to 2%. Equivalent efficacy is usually demonstrated when different agents are compared with one another in the same study population. When they are used in combination, there are additional glycemic benefits. Long-term vascular risk reduction has been demonstrated only with sulfonylureas and metformin. With few exceptions, the available oral antidiabetic agents are equally effective at lowering glucose concentrations. Their mechanisms of action are different, however, and as a result they appear to have distinct metabolic effects. These are reflected in their adverse effect profiles and their effect on cardiovascular risk, which may influence drug choice.",Thiazolidinediones are not generally considered for first-line therapy.
"Are any oral iron formulations better tolerated than ferrous sulfate
The acceptability of supplemental iron delivered from a wax-matrix tablet of ferrous sulfate was compared with that of a conventional ferrous sulfate tablet in a single-blind, parallel-group study. Both tablets were formulated to deliver 50 mg of elemental iron. The incidence of adverse effects was found to be significantly greater among 272 subjects taking the conventional tablets than among 271 subjects taking the wax-matrix preparation. Eighty-one percent of the subjects taking the wax-matrix preparation experienced no severe or moderate side effects as compared with only 50% of those taking the conventional tablets.","A nonblinded randomized trial of 543 non-anemic adult patients taking 50 mg/day elemental iron also found a lower rate of stomach-related side effects in the controlled-release group 12.2% vs 27.2%, P <.001, number needed to harm = ~7."
"What is the most effective management of acute fractures of the base of the fifth metatarsal
Successful treatment of avulsion fractures of the base of the fifth metatarsal has been achieved using both short leg casts and soft (Jones) dressings. Sixty patients who presented to our institution were prospectively randomized to be treated with either a short leg cast or a soft (Jones) dressing for the purpose of assessing the efficacy of each treatment modality. Our results demonstrated that radiographic evidence of fracture healing was present in all patients by 65 days with 44 days representing the average elapsed time for such change. All patients returned to full weightbearing and full physical activity within 96 days. Significantly, the average length of recuperation for patients treated with a soft (jones) dressing was 33 days as compared to 46 days for those treated with a short leg cast. Also, the average modified foot score for patients treated in a soft dressing was 92 (excellent) compared to 86 (good) for patients treated in a short leg cast. We conclude that a soft dressing allows patients to return to pre-injury levels of activity faster than when treated in a short leg cast and without compromising clinical or radiographic union of avulsion fractures of the base of the fifth metatarsal.","Tuberosity avulsion fractures are proximal fifth metatarsal styloid fractures resulting from a forceful pull of the lateral band of the long plantar ligament or the peroneus brevis tendon during ankle inversion.

"Does bed rest for preeclampsia improve neonatal outcomes
One hundred and thirty-five patients took part in a randomized controlled trial designed to determine whether bed rest and sedation are of any general benefit to either the mother or the baby in pregnancies complicated by mild non-albuminuric and non-symptomatic hypertension after the 28th week. The results suggest that they are not.",A randomized controlled trials of 135 nonproteinuric but hypertensive pregnant patients with diastolic blood pressures between 90 and 109 mm Hg also demonstrated no difference between patients treated with bed rest and sedation or normal activity in fetal or neonatal outcomes.
"Do angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors prevent nephropathy in type 2 diabetes without proteinuria
Diabetes mellitus is a strong risk factor for cardiovascular and renal disease. We investigated whether the angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitor ramipril can lower these risks in patients with diabetes. 3577 people with diabetes included in the Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation study, aged 55 years or older, who had a previous cardiovascular event or at least one other cardiovascular risk factor, no clinical proteinuria, heart failure, or low ejection fraction, and who were not taking ACE inhibitors, were randomly assigned ramipril (10 mg/day) or placebo, and vitamin E or placebo, according to a two-by-two factorial design. The combined primary outcome was myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular death. Overt nephropathy was a main outcome in a substudy. The study was stopped 6 months early (after 4.5 years) by the independent data safety and monitoring board because of a consistent benefit of ramipril compared with placebo. Ramipril lowered the risk of the combined primary outcome by 25% (95% CI 12-36, p=0.0004), myocardial infarction by 22% (6-36), stroke by 33% (10-50), cardiovascular death by 37% (21-51), total mortality by 24% (8-37), revascularisation by 17% (2-30), and overt nephropathy by 24% (3-40, p=0.027). After adjustment for the changes in systolic (2.4 mm Hg) and diastolic (1.0 mm Hg) blood pressures, ramipril still lowered the risk of the combined primary outcome by 25% (12-36, p=0.0004). Ramipril was beneficial for cardiovascular events and overt nephropathy in people with diabetes. The cardiovascular benefit was greater than that attributable to the decrease in blood pressure. This treatment represents a vasculoprotective and renoprotective effect for people with diabetes.","MICRO-HOPE, a subset of the HOPE trial, studied ramipril (Altace) 10 mg/d vs placebo in 2437 patients with diabetes who did not have clinical proteinuria. Patients were aged 55 years or older and had either a previous cardiovascular event or at least 1 other cardiovascular risk factor. There were 1140 patients with microalbuminuria, defined as an albumin/creatinine ratio 2 mg/mmol, and 2437 patients without. After 4.5 years, 10% of patients had developed overt nephropathy, defined as albumin/creatinine >36 mg/mmol. When all patients in the study were examined together, ramipril provided significant renal protection over placebo (RRR=24%; ARR=1%; P=.027). It also lowered the risk of myocardial infarction by 22%, stroke by 33%, and cardiovascular death by 37%. But in a separate analysis of the patients without microalbuminuria, ramipril did not significantly reduce overt nephropathy (P=.50). Ramipril also did not significantly reduce the risk of developing new microalbuminuria in this group (RRR=9%; P=.17). Further, for patients without microalbuminuria, ramipril did not reduce the combined outcomes of myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular death (odds ratio=0.85; 95% CI, 0.70-1.02)."

"What is the most effective way for relieving constipation in children aged >1 year
The aim of the present study was to examine the influence of acupuncture on chronic constipation in children and to investigate their basal plasma panopioid level and the changes of this treatment. Seventeen children constipated for at least six months were treated by five weekly placebo acupuncture sessions, followed by 10 weekly true acupuncture sessions. Their parents filled a bowel habit questionnaire. Panopioid activity was measured at time 0 and after 5, 10, and 15 acupuncture sessions. The frequency of bowel movements in males increased more gradually compared to females and reached a maximal improvement only after 10 true acupuncture sessions, from 1.4 +/- 0.6/week to 4.4 +/- 0.6/week and females from 1.4 +/- 0.3/week up to 5.6 +/- 1.2/week. The basal panopioid activity was lower in constipated children as compared to the control population and increased gradually up to control level after 10 true acupuncture sessions. This study is the first to describe a successful treatment by acupuncture of constipated children.","A nonrandomized, controlled trial of acupuncture treatment enrolled 17 children with history of constipation for a minimum of 6 months. Bowel movement frequency improved in both males (1.5 ± 0.1/week to 4.4 ± 0.6/week; P<.01) and females (1.4 ± 0.3/week to 5.6 ± 1.1/week; P<.01) after 10 acupuncture sessions.

"What are the indications for evaluating a patient with cough for pertussis
We report nine cases of severe early pertussis in infants less than 7 weeks of age. Clinical features at this age are atypical and may be confused with more common illnesses such as bronchiolitis. All were very difficult to manage. Ventilation was required for apnoeas in five cases, seizures in two or respiratory failure in two. Complications included hypotension in seven cases, pulmonary hypertension in one, pneumothoraces in two, seizures in five and co-infection in five. Two cases were referred for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and six died. Infection was confirmed either at post mortem or by culture from pernasal swabs. The mother or other close family members were symptomatic at the time and thought to be the source of infection. CONCLUSION: The nine cases suggest a significant resurgence of the infection, which may be fatal in early life. If reporting continues to increase, the immunisation schedule will need to be reviewed and secondary transmission prevented where possible, to protect this vulnerable pre-immunisation group.","A case series of 9 infants aged <7 weeks requiring admission to an intensive care unit for pertussis found that 8 had been sick for less than 4 days at the time of admission.

"What measures relieve postherpetic neuralgia
Tricyclic antidepressants (TCA) provide less than satisfactory pain relief for postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), and the role of opioids is controversial. To compare the analgesic and cognitive effects of opioids with those of TCA and placebo in the treatment of PHN. Seventy-six patients with PHN were randomized in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial. Each subject was scheduled to undergo three treatment periods (opioid, TCA, and placebo), approximately 8 weeks' duration each. Doses were titrated to maximal relief or intolerable side effects. The primary outcome measures were pain intensity (0 to 10 scale), pain relief (0 to 100%), and cognitive function. Analyses included patients who provided any pain ratings after having received at least a single dose of a study medication. Fifty patients completed two periods, and 44 patients completed all three. Mean daily maintenance doses were morphine 91 mg or methadone 15 mg and nortriptyline 89 mg or desipramine 63 mg. Opioids and TCA reduced pain (1.9 and 1.4) more than placebo (0.2; p < 0.001), with no appreciable effect on any cognitive measure. The trend favoring opioids over TCA fell short of significance (p = 0.06), and reduction in pain with opioids did not correlate with that following TCA. Treatment with opioids and TCA resulted in greater pain relief (38 and 32%) compared with placebo (11%; p < 0.001). More patients completing all three treatments preferred opioids (54%) than TCA (30%; p = 0.02). Opioids effectively treat PHN without impairing cognition. Opioids and TCA act via independent mechanisms and with varied individual effect.","An randomized controlled trials of 76 patients demonstrated that morphine, with methadone as backup, both reduced the intensity of pain and relieved pain more than placebo."
"What evaluation is best for an isolated, enlarged cervical lymph node
Family physicians frequently encounter neck masses in adult patients. A careful medical history should be obtained, and a thorough physical examination should be performed. The patient's age and the location, size, and duration of the mass are important pieces of information. Inflammatory and infectious causes of neck masses, such as cervical adenitis and cat-scratch disease, are common in young adults. Congenital masses, such as branchial anomalies and thyroglossal duct cysts, must be considered in the differential diagnosis. Neoplasms (benign and malignant) are more likely to be present in older adults. Fine-needle aspiration and biopsy and contrast-enhanced computed tomographic scanning are the best techniques for evaluating these masses. An otolaryngology consultation for endoscopy and possible excisional biopsy should be obtained when a neck mass persists beyond four to six weeks after a single course of a broad-spectrum antibiotic.","Lymph nodes with concomitant malignancy risk factors warrant immediate evaluation. For lymph nodes without signs or symptoms of inflammation or malignancy, observation for 4 to 6 weeks has been recommended. Further evaluation with imaging or biopsy is indicated if the node persists beyond 4 to 6 weeks, continues to enlarge, is located within the supraclavicular fossa, or is >3 cm."
"What is the best treatment for nocturnal enuresis in children
Enuresis (bedwetting) is a socially disruptive and stressful condition which affects around 15-20% of five year olds, and up to 2% of young adults. To assess the effects of desmopressin on nocturnal enuresis in children, and to compare desmopressin with other interventions. We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group trials register. Date of the most recent search: March 2002. The reference list of a previous version of this review was also searched. All randomised trials of desmopressin for nocturnal enuresis in children were included in the review. Comparison interventions included placebo, other drugs, alarms or behavioural methods. Trials focused solely on daytime wetting were excluded. Two reviewers independently assessed the quality of the eligible trials, and extracted data. Forty one randomised trials involving 2760 children (of whom 1813 received desmopressin) met the inclusion criteria. The quality of many of the trials was poor. Desmopressin was compared with another drug in four trials, and with alarms in seven. Desmopressin was effective in reducing bedwetting in a variety of doses and forms. Each dose of desmopressin reduced bedwetting by at least one night per week during treatment compared with placebo (e.g. 20 microg: 1.34 fewer wet nights per week, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.57). Children on desmopressin were more likely to become dry (e.g. RR for failure to achieve 14 dry nights with 20 mcg 0.84, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.91). However, there was no difference after treatment was finished. There was no clear dose-related effect of desmopressin, but the evidence was limited. Data which compared oral and nasal administration were too few to be conclusive. While desmopressin was better than diclofenac or indomethacin, and comparison with tricyclic drugs (amitriptyline and imipramine) suggested that they might be as effective as desmopressin, the data were inconclusive due to small numbers. There were more side effects with the tricyclics. In one small trial, desmopressin resulted in more wet nights than alarms towards the end of treatment (WMD 1.4, 95% CI: 0.14 to 2.66) and the chance of failure or relapse after alarms was less (RR 9.17, 95% CI 1.28 to 65.90). Although there were fewer wet nights during alarm treatment supplemented by desmopressin compared with alarms alone (WMD -1.35, 95% CI -2.32 to -0.38), the data are inconclusive about whether this is reflected in lower failure (RR 0.88, 95%CI 0.52 to 1.50) or subsequent relapse rates (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.10). Desmopressin rapidly reduced the number of wet nights per week, but there was some evidence that this was not sustained after treatment stopped. Comparison with alternative treatments suggested that desmopressin and tricyclics had similar clinical effects, but that alarms may produce more sustained benefits. However, based on the available limited evidence, these conclusions can only be tentative. Children should be advised not to drink more than 240 ml (8 oz) fluid during desmopressin treatment in order to avoid the possible risk of water intoxication.","In a Cochrane review, children treated with desmopressin had 1.7 fewer wet nights (WMD=1.7; 95% CI, -2.95 to -0.45) in the first week compared with children treated with alarms. However, at the end of 3 months, alarms were associated with 1.4 fewer wet nights per week than children treated with desmopressin (WMD=1.4; 95% CI, 0.14 to 2.66)."
"Does cranberry juice prevent or treat urinary tract infection
To determine, from a societal perspective, the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of concentrated cranberry tablets, versus cranberry juice, versus placebo used as prophylaxis against lower urinary tract infection (UTI) in adult women. One hundred fifty sexually active women aged 21 through 72 years were randomized for one year to one of three groups of prophylaxis: placebo juice + placebo tablets versus placebo juice + cranberry tablets, versus cranberry juice + placebo tablets. Tablets were taken twice daily, juice 250 ml three times daily. Outcome measures were: (1) a >50% decrease in symptomatic UTI's per year (symptoms + >or= 100 000 single organisms/ml) and (2) a >50% decrease in annual antibiotic consumption. Cost effectiveness was calculated as dollar cost per urinary tract infection prevented. Stochastic tree decision analytic modeling was used to identify specific clinical scenarios for cost savings. Both cranberry juice and cranberry tablets statistically significantly decreased the number of patients experiencing at least 1 symptomatic UTI/year (to 20% and 18% respectively) compared with placebo (to 32%) (p<0.05). The mean annual cost of prophylaxis was $624 and $1400 for cranberry tablets and juice respectively. Cost savings were greatest when patients experienced >2 symptomatic UTI's per year (assuming 3 days antibiotic coverage) and had >2 days of missed work or required protective undergarments for urgency incontinence. Total antibiotic consumption was less annually in both treatment groups compared with placebo. Cost effectiveness ratios demonstrated cranberry tablets were twice as cost effective as organic juice for prevention. Cranberry tablets provided the most cost-effective prevention for UTI.","In a placebo-controlled randomized trial, women with prior urinary tract infection who took 1 tablet of concentrated cranberry juice (at least 1:30 parts concentrated juice) twice daily (n=50) or drank 250 mL of pure unsweetened cranberry juice 3 times a day for 12 months (n=50) reduced their incidence of symptomatic UTI. Women who drank the juice had an absolute risk reduction of 12% (32% symptomatic urinary tract infection on placebo group, 20% in cranberry juice group, NNT=8.3) over 1 year. Use of cranberry juice tablets produced an absolute risk reduction of 14% (32% symptomatic urinary tract infection in placebo group; 18% in cranberry tablet group, NNT=7.1). Self-reported compliance was 75% to 90% in the juice group and 90% in the tablet group."
"What measures relieve postherpetic neuralgia
This trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of pregabalin dosed twice daily (BID) for relief of neuro-pathic pain associated with postherpetic neuralgia (PHN). The 13-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study randomized 370 patients with PHN to pregabalin (150, 300, or 600 mg/day BID) or placebo. Primary efficacy measure was endpoint mean pain score from daily pain diaries. Secondary efficacy measures included endpoint mean sleep-interference score from daily sleep diaries and Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC). Safety evaluations included adverse events (AEs), physical and neurologic examinations, 12-lead ECG, vital signs, and laboratory testing. Pregabalin provided significant, dose-proportional pain relief at endpoint: difference from placebo in mean pain score, 150 mg/day, -0.88, p = 0.0077; 300 mg/day, -1.07, p = 0.0016; 600 mg/day, -1.79, p = 0.0003. Weekly mean pain scores significantly improved as early as week 1. Sleep interference in all pregabalin groups was also significantly improved at endpoint, compared with placebo (p < 0.001), beginning at week 1 (p < 0.01). At study termination, patients in the 150 (p = 0.02) and 600 mg/day (p = 0.003) groups were more likely to report global improvement than were those in the placebo group. Most AEs were mild or moderate. Among pregabalin-treated patients, 13.5% withdrew due to AEs, most commonly for dizziness (16 patients, 5.8%), somnolence (8, 2.9%), or ataxia (7, 2.5%). Pregabalin, dosed BID, reduced neuropathic pain associated with PHN and was well tolerated. It also reduced the extent to which pain interfered with sleep. Pregabalin's effects were seen as early as week 1 and were sustained throughout the 13-week study.","Pregabalin is effective, with an number needed to treat of 4.93 (95% CI, 3.34-6.07) for up to 50% pain reduction."
"What's the best treatment for sebaceous cysts
Epidermoid cysts are asymptomatic, dome-shaped lesions that often arise from a ruptured pilosebaceous follicle. The minimal excision technique for epidermoid cyst removal is less invasive than complete surgical excision and does not require suture closure. The procedure is easy to learn, and most physicians experienced in skin surgery can perform the procedure after three to five precepted sessions. It involves making a 2- to 3-mm incision, expressing the cyst contents through compression and extracting the cyst wall through the incision. Gauze or a splatter shield should be used to protect the physician from spraying of cyst contents. The rarity of associated cancer makes histologic evaluation necessary only if unusual findings or clinical suspicion of cancer is present. Inflamed cysts are difficult to excise, and it is often preferable to postpone excision until inflammation has subsided.","The minimal incision technique involves kneading the lesion following injection of anesthetic and expressing the cyst contents through a 2- to 3-mm incision. Following expulsion of the cyst contents, the loosened capsule is delivered through the small opening. Closure with suture is optional."
"What is the best way to treat patients with white-coat hypertension
The goal of the present study was to assess the effect of antihypertensive therapy on clinic (CBP) and ambulatory (ABP) blood pressures, on ECG voltages, and on the incidence of stroke and cardiovascular events in older patients with sustained and nonsustained systolic hypertension. Patients who were >/=60 years old, with systolic CBP of 160 to 219 mm Hg and diastolic CBP of <95 mm Hg, were randomized into the double-blind placebo-controlled Systolic Hypertension in Europe (Syst-Eur) Trial. Treatment consisted of nitrendipine, with the possible addition of enalapril, hydrochlorothiazide, or both. Patients enrolled in the Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring Side Project were classified according to daytime systolic ABP into 1 of 3 subgroups: nonsustained hypertension (<140 mm Hg), mild sustained hypertension (140 to 159 mm Hg), and moderate sustained hypertension (>/=160 mm Hg). At baseline, patients with nonsustained hypertension had smaller ECG voltages (P<0.001) and, during follow-up, a lower incidence of stroke (P<0.05) and of cardiovascular complications (P=0.01) than other groups. Active treatment reduced ABP and CBP in patients with sustained hypertension but only CBP in patients with nonsustained hypertension (P<0.001). The influence of active treatment on ECG voltages (P<0.05) and on the incidence of stroke (P<0.05) and cardiovascular events (P=0.06) was more favorable than that of placebo only in patients with moderate sustained hypertension. Patients with sustained hypertension had higher ECG voltages and rates of cardiovascular complications than did patients with nonsustained hypertension. The favorable effects of active treatment on these outcomes were only statistically significant in patients with moderate sustained hypertension.","One randomized trial evaluated outcomes of antihypertensive therapy for white-coat hypertension for patients aged >60 years. Ninety-nine patients with white-coat hypertension were identified on the basis of systolic blood pressure greater than 160 mm Hg in clinic and normal 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring and were randomized to either place-bo or drug therapy. Active treatment did not significantly lower ambulatory blood pressure in white-coat hypertension, but it did reduce blood pressure measured in clinic. After a year, medication produced an absolute reduction in cardiovascular events of 8.6%, and in stroke of 4.2%. Neither result was statistically significant due to the small sample size."
"Do beta-blockers worsen respiratory status for patients with COPD
To determine baseline predictors of tolerance to the alpha/beta blocker carvedilol in everyday clinical practice. Retrospective analysis of tolerance to carvedilol in patients with chronic heart failure. Tolerance was defined as currently on carvedilol or on it at the time of death or heart transplantation. To meet the criteria for tolerance, carvedilol had to be prescribed at a stable dose for >/= 3 months. Everyday clinical practice, comprising both hospital specialist practice and private practice. Tolerance was assessed in all patients prescribed carvedilol for chronic heart failure in those practices. 808 consecutive patients in both hospital specialist (611 patients) and private practice (197 patients). Baseline predictors of tolerance assessed by proportional hazards analysis. Both univariate and multivariate analyses were performed. Within the entire cohort of 808 patients, 95 had stopped carvedilol, 606 were currently receiving the drug, 50 had died, and 44 had received a heart transplant. Overall, 88% of patients tolerated carvedilol (87% in the hospital specialist group, 92% in the private practitioner group). Factors that indicated impaired tolerance by univariate analysis were increased age in years (hazard ratio 1.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.0 to 1.3), low diastolic blood pressure (hazard ratio 1.04, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.08), and raised plasma urea concentration (hazard ratio 1.04, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.05). New York Heart Association (NYHA) class was also a marker of tolerance (proportion not tolerated: 3% class I; 9% class II; 13% class III, 22% class IV). By multivariate analysis, no single baseline variable was an independent marker of inability to tolerate carvedilol. Tolerance was also assessed in relation to traditional precautions or relative contraindications to beta blockade. Tolerance in these subgroups was: chronic obstructive airways disease/asthma 85% (89 patients), diabetes 86% (127 patients), peripheral vascular disease 84% (58 patients), concomitant amiodarone treatment 83% (230 patients), and heart rate < 70 beats/min 84% (184 patients). beta Blocker treatment was well tolerated in everyday clinical practice, including non-hospital-based private practice. There was no single predictor of poor tolerance on multivariate analysis, although there was a clear association with NYHA class as well as age, diastolic blood pressure, and plasma urea on univariate analysis. Carvedilol was tolerated well among selected patients with traditional contraindications to beta blockade in this situation.","A retrospective analysis of a cohort study analyzed the tolerability of carvedilol, a nonselective beta- and alpha-adrenergic blocker, in patients with COPD who had been taking the medication for at least 3 months. Eighty-five percent of the 89 patients with COPD tolerated carvedilol. The authors of the study (which was funded by the manufacturer of carvedilol) did not state why the other 15% of patients did not tolerate carvedilol, nor did they mention whether the patients with COPD had reversible airflow obstruction."

Reports of hypovitaminosis D among adults in the United States have drawn attention to the vitamin D status of children. National data on hypovitaminosis D among children are not yet available. Reports from 2000 and 2001 of rickets among children living in North Carolina, Texas, Georgia, and the mid-Atlantic region, however, confirmed the presence of vitamin D deficiency among some US children and prompted new clinical guidelines to prevent its occurrence. We reviewed reports of nutritional rickets among US children <18 y of age that were published between 1986 and 2003. We identified 166 cases of rickets in 22 published studies. Patients were 4-54 mo of age, although in 17 studies the maximal age was <30 mo. Approximately 83% of children with rickets were described as African American or black, and 96% were breast-fed. Among children who were breast-fed, only 5% of records indicated vitamin D supplementation during breast-feeding. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recently recommended a minimal intake of 200 IU/d vitamin D for all infants, beginning in the first 2 mo of life. AAP recommends a vitamin D supplement for breast-fed infants who do not consume at least 500 mL of a vitamin D-fortified beverage. Given our finding of a disproportionate number of rickets cases among young, breast-fed, black children, we recommend that education regarding AAP guidelines emphasize the higher risk of rickets among these children. Education should also emphasize the importance of weaning children to a diet adequate in both vitamin D and calcium.","Among the 166 published cases of rickets in the US from 1986 to 2003, 83% were categorized as African American or black. Ninety-six percent of cases were breastfed."
"Do antibiotics prevent recurrent urinary tract infection in children with anatomic abnormalities
The recurrence rate for urinary tract infections in children is estimated at between 30% and 40%. The use of low doses of antibiotics as prophylaxis for recurrent urinary tract infections is common clinical practice. However, prolonged antimicrobial therapy has the potential to contribute to problems of bacterial resistance and antimicrobial side effects. The aim of this review was to systematically examine the available evidence for the effectiveness of this intervention. We conducted a literature search of 3 electronic databases for the period 1966 to 1999. We also searched bibliographies from conference proceedings and contacted content experts to ensure completeness of our database. Each trial was evaluated on the basis of the following inclusion criteria: target population (children), intervention (antibiotic v. no antibiotic), outcome (number of urinary tract infections) and study design (randomized controlled trial). Quality was assessed for the studies that met these criteria. Most of the studies identified were case series and cohort studies. Only 6 randomized trials fulfilled the inclusion criteria. All were of low quality (median 2, range 0 to 2 [maximum quality score 5]). Three trials dealt with children who had anatomically normal urinary tracts, and three included children with neurogenic bladder. The rate of infections for patients with normal urinary tracts ranged from 0 to 4.0 per 10 patient-years for the treatment groups and from 4.0 to 16.7 for the control groups. The recurrence rates for patients with neurogenic bladders in 2 trials were 2.9 and 17.1 per 10 patient-years for the treatment groups and 1.5 and 33.0 for the control groups. The available evidence for using antimicrobial prophylaxis to prevent urinary tract infection in children with normal urinary tracts or neurogenic bladder is of low quality. This suggests that the magnitude of any benefit should at best be questioned. The surprising lack of data for children with reflux is of concern. Well-designed trials are needed to optimize the use of antimicrobials in children with recurrent urinary tract infection.","A recent systematic review of studies done in children with normal urinary tracts, as well in children with neurogenic bladders, found that the available evidence is of low quality. Only 6 out of 31 potential studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. These were small (mean sample size was 28), and the quality scores of all 6 trials were low, indicating that the evidence may be unreliable. Two of 3 studies done in children with normal urinary tracts demonstrated statistically significant higher rates of urinary tract infection recurrence in control groups compared with treatment groups receiving 6 to 10 months of either nitrofurantoin or cotrimoxazole (RR=24-31). The third study showed no difference between groups. One of 2 trials in children with neurogenic bladder demonstrated higher recurrence rates of 2.9 per 10 patient years for patients receiving antibiotics compared with 1.5 in the untreated group. The other study showed lower recurrence rates of 17.1 for patients receiving antibiotics, compared with 33 in the untreated group. Neither of these findings were statistically significant."
"When are empiric antibiotics appropriate for urinary tract infection symptoms
Symptoms suggestive of acute urinary tract infection (UTI) constitute one of the most common reasons for women to visit clinicians. Although the clinical encounter typically involves taking a history and performing a physical examination, the diagnostic accuracy of the clinical assessment for UTI remains uncertain. To review the accuracy and precision of history taking and physical examination for the diagnosis of UTI in women. We conducted a MEDLINE search for articles published from 1966 through September 2001 and manually reviewed bibliographies, 3 commonly used clinical skills textbooks, and contacted experts in the field. Studies were included if they contained original data on the accuracy or precision of history or physical examination for diagnosing acute uncomplicated UTI in women. One author initially screened titles and abstracts found by our search. Nine of 464 identified studies met inclusion criteria. Two authors independently abstracted data from the included studies. Disagreements were resolved by discussion and consensus with a third author. Four symptoms and 1 sign significantly increased the probability of UTI: dysuria (summary positive likelihood ratio [LR], 1.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2-2.0), frequency (LR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.1-3.0), hematuria (LR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.3-2.9), back pain (LR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.2-2.1), and costovertebral angle tenderness (LR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.1-2.5). Four symptoms and 1 sign significantly decreased the probability of UTI: absence of dysuria (summary negative LR, 0.5; 95% CI, 0.3-0.7), absence of back pain (LR, 0.8; 95% CI, 0.7-0.9), history of vaginal discharge (LR, 0.3; 95% CI, 0.1-0.9), history of vaginal irritation (LR, 0.2; 95% CI, 0.1-0.9), and vaginal discharge on examination (LR, 0.7; 95% CI, 0.5-0.9). Of all individual diagnostic signs and symptoms, the 2 most powerful were history of vaginal discharge and history of vaginal irritation, which significantly decreased the likelihood of UTI when present (LRs, 0.3 and 0.2, respectively). One study examined combinations of symptoms, and the resulting LRs were more powerful (24.6 for the combination of dysuria and frequency but no vaginal discharge or irritation). One study of patients with recurrent UTI found that self-diagnosis significantly increased the probability of UTI (LR, 4.0). In women who present with 1 or more symptoms of UTI, the probability of infection is approximately 50%. Specific combinations of symptoms (eg, dysuria and frequency without vaginal discharge or irritation) raise the probability of UTI to more than 90%, effectively ruling in the diagnosis based on history alone. In contrast, history taking, physical examination, and dipstick urinalysis are not able to reliably lower the posttest probability of disease to a level where a UTI can be ruled out when a patient presents with 1 or more symptoms.",An evidence-based review found 5 high-quality studies on the diagnosis of acute uncomplicated urinary tract infection among women. The triad of dysuria with frequency but without vaginal symptoms increased the probability of significant bacteriuria on culture from 50% to 96% (LR+=24.6).
"What regimens eradicate Heliobacter pylori
Although triple therapies with a proton pump inhibitor, clarithromycin and either amoxycillin or metronidazole are the most widely accepted treatment for Helicobacter pylori infection, there is no consensus on how long treatment should be maintained for. To evaluate whether increasing the length of triple therapies beyond 7 days improves treatment efficacy. An extensive search of the literature was performed. Reports of randomized trials comparing different lengths of therapy were selected. Short (7-day) vs. long (10/14-day) therapies were compared, and three-way comparison of 7-day vs. 10-day, 10-day vs. 14-day and 7-day vs. 14-day therapies was performed. Meta-analysis was conducted using conventional shareware (Review Manager 4.0). The Peto Odds Ratio using a fixed model analysis was calculated for each comparison. Thirteen studies were identified. Pooled 10- to 14-day therapies achieved better results than 7-day schedules. In head-to-head comparisons, only 14-day therapies were significantly better than 7-day treatments. Improvement in cure rates ranged from 7 to 9%. Comparisons of 7-day vs. 10-day and 10-day vs. 14-day also showed a non-significant trend towards better cure rates with longer therapies. Fourteen-day, proton pump inhibitor-based triple therapy achieves better results than 7-day schedules. Additional data are necessary to evaluate 10-day therapies.","Fourteen-day triple therapy of proton pump inhibitors + clarithromycin + metronidazoleoramoxicillin. A meta-analysis of 13 studies found the eradication rate for 14-day therapy was 81% (95% confidence interval [CI], 77%-85%), compared with 72% (95% CI, 68%-76%) for 7-day therapy. The eradication rate for 10-day therapy (83%; 95% CI, 75%-89%), however, was not significantly better than that for 7-day therapy (80%; 95% CI, 71%-86%). Side effects were more frequent in the longer therapies, but did not lead to discontinuation of therapy."
"What is the most effective treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in children
Optimal medications for children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) would be effective, well tolerated, and long acting and not cause mood swings or worsen comorbid conditions. Current medications work on brain dopamine and/or norepinephrine systems, which are thought to be involved in ADHD. The medication class with the most evidence of efficacy in ADHD is stimulants, but they may be abused, are effective for only 4 to 12 hours, and may cause mood swings or increase tic severity. In recent years, alternative treatments have been explored. Tricyclic antidepressants have efficacy comparable to that of stimulants but may cause constipation, dry mouth, tremors, blood pressure changes, and potentially serious side effects including cardiac conduction and repolarization delays. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors may improve ADHD symptoms but are associated with severe dietary restrictions. Serotonin reuptake inhibitors have little or no effect in ADHD but may improve comorbid depression. Bupropion, although less effective than stimulants, may improve both ADHD symptoms and comorbid depression. Antihypertensive agents may improve impulsivity, hyperactivity, and comorbid tics but cause sedation or rebound hypertension. Atomoxetine, which is being developed for ADHD, reduces symptoms of ADHD without exacerbating comorbid conditions and is associated with only minor side effects, including subtle changes in blood pressure and heart rate. Before prescribing a treatment, physicians should consider the appropriateness and effectiveness of any medication for children with ADHD, who may be less tolerant of side effects and less able to monitor and express concerns about their well-being than adults.","Second-line medications such as clonidine, pemoline (Cylert), and tricyclic antidepressants have more potential serious side effects and are not well studied."
"Does stimulant therapy help adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
To determine (a) the long-term and short-term effectiveness and safety of pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children and adults and (b) whether combined interventions are more effective than individual interventions. MEDLINE (from 1966), CINAHL (from 1982), HEALTHStar (from 1975), PsycINFO (from 1984), EMBASE (from 1984), and the Cochrane Library searches were completed in November 1997. Reference lists of eligible studies and files of members of the research team and partner organizations were also searched. Studies were selected if they focused on the treatment of ADHD in humans and were published in any language as a full report in peer-reviewed journals. Studies including conditions other than ADHD were reported if separate subgroup analyses for patients with ADHD were provided. Two reviewers independently extracted data for 41 variables on general characteristics, along with detailed information on interventions, outcomes, and tests. Differences were resolved by consensus or by a third researcher. Studies were not combined quantitatively because the quality of reporting was low and heterogeneity existed across outcome measures and tests. Seventy-eight studies (77 randomized controlled trials) met the inclusion criteria. Twenty-three studies compared drugs and showed few, if any, differences among methylphenidate (MPH), dextroamphetamine (DEX), and pemoline; studies comparing stimulants with tricyclic antidepressants (2) were inconclusive. Six studies compared drugs with nondrug interventions and showed consistently that stimulants, particularly MPH, may be more effective than nonpharmacological interventions. Twenty studies compared combination therapies with a stimulant or a nondrug intervention alone; no additional beneficial effects for combination therapies were shown. Nine studies compared tricyclic antidepressants with placebo and showed that desipramine may be more effective than placebo; no consistent effect was shown for imipramine. Fourteen studies (13 in school children and 1 in adults) evaluated long-term therapy (> or = 12 weeks) and showed a trend to general improvement regardless of treatment, but the length of followup was inadequate. MPH may reduce behavioral disturbance in children with ADHD while it is taken. Academic performance does not appear to be improved with stimulants. Twelve studies evaluated treatment in adults with ADHD. For MPH vs. placebo, the results were contradictory. Antidepressants may be effective in adults, but no beneficial effect was seen with pemoline, nicotine, or phenylalanine compared with placebo. Thirty-two reports (29 studies) evaluated adverse effects of drug therapy; many of the side effects associated with stimulant use appear to be relatively mild and of short duration and to respond to dosing or timing adjustments. Data are inadequate on the long-term effects and severity of adverse effects of most interventions. This report describes rigorous systematic reviews on the treatment of ADHD, ready for incorporation into evidence-based clinical practice guidelines or performance measures. The report also provides a detailed description of the many limitations of the evidence available and provides recommendations to fill existing knowledge gaps. Studies on ADHD have low reporting quality, methodological flaws, and heterogeneity across outcome measures and tests. A detailed description is included of the many limitations of the available evidence plus recommendations to fill existing knowledge gaps. Fulfilling such knowledge gaps will not be easy and will require genuine collaboration among decisionmakers.",A well-done systematic review of 12 trials assessing the efficacy of stimulant therapy in the treatment of adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder did not find sufficient evidence that stimulants were effective. Significant heterogeneity and poor reporting of methodology was seen among the studies.
"What is the best way to treat tinea cruris
We undertook a prospective, multicentre, double-blind, placebo controlled, randomised, parallel-group study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the topical 1% emulsion gel formulation of Lamisil in the treatment of tinea corporis/cruris. Eighty-three patients with clinically and mycologically confirmed tinea corporis/cruris were enrolled from 6 dermatology practices. Of the 62 patients in the intent-to-treat population, 29 were randomised to 1% Lamisil emulsion gel (23 male, 6 female; mean age 42 years, range 19-79 years) and 33 to placebo (25 male, 8 female; mean age 36 years, range 16-73 years). The gels were applied once daily for 1 week. Mycological cure (negative microscopy and culture results) and effectiveness of treatment (mycological cure plus no or minimal signs and symptoms) were measured on day 7, weeks 2, 4 and 8, and at the end of the study. At the study end, rates mycological cure were 83% for Lamisil 1% emulsion gel and 27% for placebo gel (p < 0.001), with respective rates for effective treatment of 83 and 21% (p < 0.001). Complete cure was recorded for 59% of patients receiving Lamisil 1% emulsion gel and 13% of patient receiving placebo gel (p < 0.001). We conclude that a 1-week course of Lamisil 1% emulsion gel is significantly more effective in the treatment of tinea corporis/cruris than placebo gel in respect of complete cure, mycological cure and effective treatment.","One placebo controlled trial showed the 1% emulsion-gel version (Lamisil) was effective in 89% of the study population vs 23% of the placebo group (NNT=1.5); it was particularly suitable on hairy skin. Seven weeks post-treatment, 84% of the intent-to-treat population of the Lamisil group remained mycologically negative."
"Do calcium supplements prevent postmenopausal osteoporotic fractures
Inadequate dietary intake of calcium and vitamin D may contribute to the high prevalence of osteoporosis among older persons. We studied the effects of three years of dietary supplementation with calcium and vitamin D on bone mineral density, biochemical measures of bone metabolism, and the incidence of nonvertebral fractures in 176 men and 213 women 65 years of age or older who were living at home. They received either 500 mg of calcium plus 700 IU of vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) per day or placebo. Bone mineral density was measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, blood and urine were analyzed every six months, and cases of nonvertebral fracture were ascertained by means of interviews and verified with use of hospital records. The mean (+/-SD) changes in bone mineral density in the calcium-vitamin D and placebo groups were as follows: femoral neck, +0.50+/-4.80 and -0.70+/-5.03 percent, respectively (P=0.02); spine,+2.12+/-4.06 and +1.22+/-4.25 percent (P=0.04); and total body, +0.06+/-1.83 and -1.09+/-1.71 percent (P<0.001). The difference between the calcium-vitamin D and placebo groups was significant at all skeletal sites after one year, but it was significant only for total-body bone mineral density in the second and third years. Of 37 subjects who had nonvertebral fractures, 26 were in the placebo group and 11 were in the calcium-vitamin D group (P=0.02). In men and women 65 years of age or older who are living in the community, dietary supplementation with calcium and vitamin D moderately reduced bone loss measured in the femoral neck, spine, and total body over the three-year study period and reduced the incidence of nonvertebral fractures.","A randomized controlled trial of healthy, community-dwelling people 65 years of age and older (55% women) showed daily supplementation with 500 mg calcium and 700 international units vitamin D for 3 years decreased nonvertebral fractures vs. placebo (response rate [RR]=0.54; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.12-0.77; number needed to treat [NNT]=15)."
"What are the most effective nonpharmacologic therapies for irritable bowel syndrome
Studies of antidepressants and psychological treatments in functional bowel disorders (FBD) are methodologically limited. The aim of this study was to assess the clinical efficacy and safety of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) against education (EDU) and desipramine (DES) against placebo (PLA) in female patients with moderate to severe FBD (irritable bowel syndrome, functional abdominal pain, painful constipation, and unspecified FBD). We also evaluated the amenability of clinically meaningful subgroups to these treatments. This randomized, comparator-controlled, multicenter trial enrolled 431 adults from the University of North Carolina and the University of Toronto with moderate to severe symptoms of FBD. Participants received psychological (CBT vs. EDU) or antidepressant (DES vs. PLA) treatment for 12 weeks. Clinical, physiologic, and psychosocial assessments were performed before and at the end of treatment. The intention-to-treat analysis showed CBT as significantly more effective than EDU (P = 0.0001; responder rate, 70% CBT vs. 37% EDU; number needed to treat [NNT ], 3.1). DES did not show significant benefit over PLA in the intention-to-treat analysis (P = 0.16; responder rate, 60% DES vs. 47% PLA; NNT, 8.1) but did show a statistically significant benefit in the per-protocol analysis (P = 0.01; responder rate, 73% DES vs. 49% PLA; NNT, 5.2), especially when participants with nondetectable blood levels of DES were excluded (P = 0.002). Improvement was best gauged by satisfaction with treatment. Subgroup analyses showed that DES was beneficial over PLA for moderate more than severe symptoms, abuse history, no depression, and diarrhea-predominant symptoms; CBT was beneficial over EDU for all subgroups except for depression. For female patients with moderate to severe FBD, CBT is effective and DES may be effective when taken adequately. Certain clinical subgroups are more or less amenable to these treatments.","A single-blinded study comparing cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) with patient education alone found cognitive-behavioral treatment more effective. The effect size was 0.50 (defined as moderate; 95% CI, 0.2-0.8). Analysis of response rates found that 73% responded to cognitive-behavioral treatment vs 41.3% in the education group (NNT=3.2)."
"What is a reasonable initial approach to the patient with fatigue
To describe the characteristics of patients attending their general practitioners and complaining of fatigue or being ""tired all the time."" Prospective study of cohort aged 16 years and older with follow up at two weeks and by questionnaires at two and six months. 220 patients (164 women) with mean age 43 years and an age-sex matched comparison group. Doctors and patients in four practices in Lancashire, Mid Glamorgan, Suffolk, and Surrey. General clinical data, results from standard group of laboratory tests, fatigue questionnaire, and 12 item general health questionnaire. Over twice as many patients with fatigue had high scores on the health questionnaire compared with the comparison group (156 (75%) v 69 (34%)). Results of laboratory tests were abnormal and contributed to the diagnosis in 19 patients. 59 out of 102 patients who responded had high fatigue scores six months later. Patients with persistent fatigue were more likely to have a history of anxiety or depression and to have had fatigue for more than three months on entry to the study. Women are particularly at risk of fatigue. The outcome is better if patients have had symptoms for three months or less or there is no history of emotional illness.","Physicians performed a thorough history and physical; took a complete blood count; tested the levels of blood or urine glucose, electrolytes, sedimentation rate, TSH, and urea; and tested for mononucleosis (if younger than 40). Only 19 (8%) were given a diagnosis based on the laboratory evaluation: 8 had anemia, 3 were hypothyroid, 3 had mononucleosis, 3 had other infections, 1 had diabetes, and 1 had carcinomatosis. Regarding prognosis, 59% of patients were still fatigued after 6 months."
"Which tests are the most useful for diagnosing pelvic inflammatory disease
These guidelines for the treatment of persons who have sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) were developed by CDC after consultation with a group of professionals knowledgeable in the field of STDs who met in Atlanta, Georgia, during April 19-21, 2005. The information in this report updates the Sexually Transmitted Diseases Treatment Guidelines, 2002 (MMWR 2002;51[No. RR-6]).

"What is the risk of bowel strangulation in an adult with an untreated inguinal hernia
Complications that develop in groin hernias, such as irreducibility and obstruction, with or without strangulation may make an easily treatable condition a life-threatening one. Identification of risk factors that may predict development would help place the patient in a high-risk group. Priority admission and early elective surgery for such a patient would avoid significant mortality and morbidity. This is a 10-year combined prospective and retrospective study of children and adults. Records of complicated groin hernias were identified from July 1985 to July 1995 from the outpatient department and available inpatient medical records. The same number of controls of simple uncomplicated hernias were then chosen using random number tables from among the large number belonging to the same time period. These two groups were then compared and analysed using statistical methods for age, sex, side of hernia, site of hernia (inguinal/femoral), duration of hernia, length of the waiting list for elective surgery, and contents of the hernial sac along with some other parameters to identify patients with high-risk factors. Age was found to be a significant risk factor and predicted complications in both elderly adults and very young children. Sex of the patient (male) and side of hernia (right) were significant risk factors in children only. Site of hernia was an important risk factor and adults with femoral hernia were most likely to experience complications. Duration of hernia for less than a year proved to be the most important risk factor for both children and adults. The majority of patients with complicated hernias had not presented earlier in the outpatient department, which implies that most hernias that become complicated do so within a very short time before patient referral. Mortality was high in patients with coexisting diseases, while morbidity was affected by viability of contents of the hernial sac which in turn was directly affected by duration of irreducibility or delay in presentation. The risk factors useful in predicting complications in an adult patient with groin hernia were age (older age group), duration of hernia (short duration), type of hernia (femoral more than inguinal) and coexisting medical illness. In children, the risk factors were age (very young), gender (male), short duration of hernia and side (right side).",A case-control study found that the risk of strangulation was higher for hernias of shorter duration.
"Which factors increase the risk of an infant becoming an overweight child
To investigate the relationship between breast-feeding and obesity in childhood. Systematic review and meta-analysis of published epidemiological studies (cohort, case-control or cross-sectional studies) comparing early feeding-mode and adjusting for potential confounding factors. Electronic databases were searched and reference lists of relevant articles were checked. Calculations of pooled estimates were conducted in fixed- and random-effects models. Heterogeneity was tested by Q-test. Publication bias was assessed from funnel plots and by a linear regression method. Odds ratio (OR) for obesity in childhood defined as body mass index (BMI) percentiles. Nine studies with more than 69,000 participants met the inclusion criteria. The meta-analysis showed that breast-feeding reduced the risk of obesity in childhood significantly. The adjusted odds ratio was 0.78, 95% CI (0.71, 0.85) in the fixed model. The assumption of homogeneity of results of the included studies could not be refuted (Q-test for heterogeneity, P>0.3), stratified analyses showed no differences regarding different study types, age groups, definition of breast-feeding or obesity and number of confounding factors adjusted for. A dose-dependent effect of breast-feeding duration on the prevalence of obesity was reported in four studies. Funnel plot regression gave no indication of publication bias. Breast-feeding seems to have a small but consistent protective effect against obesity in children.","A meta-analysis of 9 studies found that 7 showed a significantly lower risk of overweight among children who were breastfed (odds ratio [OR]=0.78; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.71-0.85). Four of the studies demonstrated that longer duration of breastfeeding offered greater protection than shorter duration. Two of the 4 studies defined longer duration as more than 6 months, 1 defined it as more than 3 months, and 1 examined breastfeeding for periods of less than 1 week, 1 week to 1 month, 2 to 3 months, 4 to 6 months, 7 to 9 months, and longer than 9 months, showing a duration-dependent decrease in risk. The other studies in the meta-analysis evaluated never-breastfed vs ever-breastfed infants."
"Do antibiotics prevent recurrent urinary tract infection in children with anatomic abnormalities
There are increasing concerns regarding antimicrobial resistance in Canada. Data are limited on the prevalence, patterns of resistance and risk factors associated with resistant organisms, including coliforms, in children. This study was done to address these issues as they relate to urinary tract isolates of Escherichia coli in a tertiary care pediatric centre in Ottawa. A surveillance study was conducted from December 1992 to December 1994. Susceptibility testing of urinary tract isolates of E. coli was performed using a panel of antimicrobial agents. A case-control study was also conducted for subjects with isolates resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (T-S), this drug being used a representative ""first-line"" agent. A total of 1636 consecutive isolates were obtained from 967 subjects. Of the 1636 isolates, 736 (45.0%) were resistant to ampicillin, 514 (31.4%) were resistant to T-S, 363 (22.2%) were resistant to both ampicillin and T-S, and 27 (1.7%) were resistant to both ampicillin and gentamicin. In the case-control study 274 children with isolates resistant to T-S were matched with 274 children who had T-S-sensitive isolates obtained during the study period or the preceding or subsequent 6 months. Multivariate analyses indicated that subjects who had received antimicrobials for more than 4 weeks in the previous 6 months were about 23 times more likely to have isolates resistant to T-S than were subjects without this risk factor (odds ratio [OR] 23.4, 95% confidence interval [CI] 12.0-47.6). Children with genitourinary tract abnormalities were 2.4 times more likely to have resistant isolates than those without such abnormalities (95% CI 1.2-4.5). Compared with children who had no hospital admissions in the previous year, those with 1 admission in that period were more likely to have resistant isolates (OR 2.3, 95% CI 1.4-7.5), as were those with 2 or more admissions in that period (OR 3.2, 95% CI 1.1-4.8). Compared with children aged 2-6 years, children under 2 years of age were less likely to have resistant isolates (OR 0.3, 95% CI 0.2-0.8). Selective antimicrobial pressure and multiple admissions to hospital were among the risk factors associated with antimicrobial resistance. The finding of a low but definite level of resistance to both ampicillin and gentamicin is important for the selection of empiric therapy for sepsis in neonates. The role of inexpensive first-line agents in the outpatient treatment and prevention of urinary tract infections requires re-examination, particularly in children who have recently received antimicrobial therapy.","One study of resistance found that children who received antibiotics for more than 4 weeks in the previous 6 months were more likely to have resistant Escherichia coli isolates than children who had not received prolonged antibiotic treatment (odds ratio [OR]=13.9; 95% CI, 8.2-23.5). Children with abnormalities of the genitourinary tract were approximately 4 times more likely to have resistant isolates of E coli than children without abnormalities of the genitourinary tract (OR=3.9; 95% CI, 2.7-5.7)."
"Which nondrug alternatives can help with insomnia
Insomnia is a pervasive condition with various causes, manifestations, and health consequences. Regardless of the initial cause or event that precipitates insomnia, it is perpetuated into a chronic condition through learned behaviors and cognitions that foster sleeplessness. This article reviews the rationale and objectives of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), a safe and effective treatment for insomnia that may be used to augment hypnotic drugs or as a monotherapy. Cognitive-behavioral management of insomnia includes 3 components--behavioral, cognitive, and educational modules--and is usually presented in a group or individual therapy setting. Each treatment procedure is detailed herein, and recommendations for implementation are given. The evidence supporting this behavioral approach shows that CBT is effective for 70% to 80% of patients and that it can significantly reduce several measures of insomnia, including sleep-onset latency and wake-after-sleep onset. Aside from the clinically measurable changes, this therapy system enables many patients to regain a feeling of control over their sleep, thereby reducing the emotional distress that sleep disturbances cause. Some clinical and practical issues that often arise when implementing this therapeutic approach for insomnia are also discussed.","cognitive-behavioral treatment interventions combine empirically tested behavioral, cognitive, and educational procedures to alter faulty beliefs and attitudes, modify sleep habits, and regulate sleep-wake schedules."

After a two week baseline, 209 asthmatic children (mean age 10 years, range 6-17) were randomly allocated to receive 4 mg nedocromil sodium (n = 110) or placebo (n = 99) four times daily for 12 weeks in addition to their current treatment. The children completed daily diary cards and visited the clinic at four week intervals. Statistically significant differences in favour of nedocromil sodium were seen for clinician assessment of asthma severity and diary card symptom scores, pulmonary function and inhaled beta 2 bronchodilator use. Total symptom score decreased by 50% from baseline in the nedocromil sodium group and by 9% in the placebo group during the final four weeks. Nedocromil sodium was considered very or moderately effective by 78% of children/parents (placebo 59%) and 73% of clinicians (placebo 50%). Nausea, headache and sleepiness, and dyspnoea led to withdrawal of one child from nedocromil sodium and placebo treatments, respectively. Reports of sore throat and headache were marginally greater with the nedocromil sodium treatment. It is concluded that nedocromil sodium was both effective and safe in the treatment of asthma in children.","An randomized controlled trials compared 4 mg of inhaled nedocromil 4 times daily with inhaled placebo among 209 asthmatic children for 12 weeks.3 After 8 weeks, they found a statistically significant reduction in total daily asthma symptom scores (50% nedocromil vs 9% placebo; P<.01). The proportion of parents and children rating treatment as moderately or very effective was 78% in the treatment group and 59% in the placebo group (number needed to treat [NNT]=5.2; P<.01); clinicians' ratings were 73% for nedocromil and 50% for placebo (NNT=4.3; P<.01). The frequency of side effects-including nausea, headache, and sleepiness-did not reach statistical significance; however, the nedocromil group reported up to a 20% incidence of sore throat."
"What is the best way to distinguish type 1 and 2 diabetes
Type 1 diabetes is caused by the immune-mediated destruction of islet insulin-secreting beta-cells. This chronic destructive process is associated with both cellular and humoral immune changes in the peripheral blood that can be detected months or even years before the onset of clinical diabetes. Throughout this prediabetic period, metabolic changes, including altered glucose tolerance and reduced insulin secretion, deteriorate at variable rates and eventually result in clinical diabetes. A fraction of individuals with humoral immunological changes have clinical diabetes that initially is not insulin-requiring. The onset of diabetes in these patients is usually in adult life, and because their diabetes is at least initially not insulin-requiring, they appear clinically to be affected by type 2 diabetes. Such patients probably have the same disease process as patients with type 1 diabetes in that they have similar HLA genetic susceptibility as well as autoantibodies to islet antigens, low insulin secretion, and a higher rate of progression to insulin dependency. These patients are defined as being affected by an autoimmune type of diabetes not requiring insulin at diagnosis, which is also named latent autoimmune diabetes of the adult (LADA). Special attention should be paid to diagnose such patients because therapy may influence the speed of progression toward insulin dependency, and in this respect, efforts should be made to protect residual C-peptide secretion. LADA can serve as a model for designing new strategies for prevention of type 1 diabetes but also as a target group for prevention in its own right.","Newly diagnosed 12-year-old children have an equal incidence of type 1 as type 2 diabetes. Likewise, adults with type 2 phenotype (no initial insulin requirement) can present with positive autoantibodies typically found in younger type 1 patients. Older patients who fit this profile have been classified as type 1.5 diabetes or latent autoimmune disease in adults (LADA)."
"Is yearly chest x-ray screening helpful in reducing mortality for smokers
The study was launched in the mid-1970s to explore the capability of screening by chest X-ray and sputum cytology to be used as an effective component of the lung cancer control program in the Czech Republic, a Central European country with a high and increasing occurrence of lung cancer in men at that time. A complementary objective of this report is to ascertain whether the cumulative numbers of lung cancer deaths would equalize in the two randomized groups during a prolonged follow-up period. Six thousand three hundred sixty-four males who were heavy cigarette smokers, aged 40-64 years, were enrolled during a general health survey in 6 districts of the Czech Republic. At initial X-ray and sputum examination, 19 prevalent lung carcinoma cases were diagnosed. After stratified randomization, the remaining subjects entered a 3-year study: the intervention group (3171 participants) was subjected to semiannual chest X-rays and sputum investigation whereas the controls (3174 participants) had 1 examination only by chest X-rays and sputum investigation, 3 years after entry. During a further 3-year follow-up, a chest X-ray was taken at the end of Years 4, 5, and 6 for both the intervention and control groups. Subjects in both groups who were suspected to have lung carcinoma or other disease on the basis of screening results or symptoms were subjected to appropriate diagnostic studies and treatment. Data on all causes of death in Years 1-6 and on deaths from the lung cancer in Years 7-15 of participants in the intervention and control groups were compared. The incidence rate of lung carcinoma from the intervention group was significantly higher than from the controls in the initial 3-year study period (P < 0.05), but not for the initial 6-year period (P = 0.06). Lung carcinoma cases detected by screening were identified at an earlier stage, were more often resectable, and had a significantly better survival than interval cases diagnosed mainly because of symptoms. There was no significant difference in the lung cancer mortality rate between the 2 groups in the initial 3-year study period or during follow-up prolonged up to Year 15 since enrollment. The study gave no evidence that screening for lung cancer by chest X-ray is beneficial in terms of reducing mortality. Based on the results of this study, there is no justification to recommend semiannual screening as a component of a comprehensive lung cancer control program.","A trial involved male smokers who were randomized to undergo chest x-ray and sputum cytology either every 6 months or after 3 years. After 3 years, both groups were screened annually with chest x-ray alone for an additional 3 years. There was no significant difference in lung cancer mortality at any point, including at a 15-year post-trial follow-up."
"What are the best prophylactic drugs for migraine
To evaluate the efficacy and safety of extended-release divalproex sodium compared with placebo in prophylactic monotherapy treatment of migraine headache. This was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study. Subjects with more than two migraine headache attacks during a 4-week baseline were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio at each center to receive either extended-release divalproex sodium or matching placebo once daily for 12 weeks. Subjects initiated treatment on 500 mg once daily for 1 week, and the dose was then increased to 1,000 mg once daily with an option, if intolerance occurred, to permanently decrease the dose to 500 mg during the second week. Reduction from baseline in 4-week migraine headache rate was the primary efficacy variable. Migraine headaches separated by a < 24-hour headache-free interval were counted as single migraines in calculating migraine headache rates. Tolerance and safety were also evaluated. The mean reductions in 4-week migraine headache rate were 1.2 (from a baseline mean of 4.4) in the extended-release divalproex sodium group and 0.6 (from a baseline mean of 4.2) in the placebo group (p = 0.006); reductions with extended-release divalproex sodium were significantly greater than with placebo in all three 4-week segments of the treatment period. No significant differences were detected between treatment groups in either the overall incidence or in the incidence of any specific treatment-emergent adverse event; 8% of subjects treated with extended-release divalproex sodium and 9% of those treated with placebo discontinued for adverse events. Extended-release divalproex sodium is an efficacious, well-tolerated, safe, and easy-to-use once-a-day prophylactic antimigraine medication.","A study of the extended-release form of divalproex sodium demonstrated a 4-week reduction in headache rate to 1.2 from a baseline of 4.4, compared with a decrease of 0.6 for placebo (95% confidence interval [CI] of treatment difference, 0.2-1.2)."
"What is the initial work-up in the diagnosis of hypertension
To compare the electrocardiogram (ECG) and the echocardiogram for demonstration of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and the prognostic values of these methods. Literature study. Department of General Practice, Social and Nursing Home Medicine, R.C. University of Nijmegen, the Netherlands. Using articles retrieved by means of a search action in Medline (1962-January 1996), a study was made of the differences between determination of LVH by ECG and by echocardiography with regard to the sensitivities and specificities for measuring anatomical LVH, and their predictive values concerning cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The sensitivity of echocardiography for the prediction of anatomical LVH (88-93%) exceeded that of ECG (21-54%), while both methods had a high specificity (77-97%). ECG-LVH seemed a better predictor of cardiovascular complications than echo-LVH. Echocardiography is the better instrument for screening for LVH, but ECG should keep its place in the diagnostics of LVH in view of its high predictive value for morbidity and mortality and its availability to primary health care. In regard to LVH, echocardiography measures only morphological disorders, while ECG also detects functional disorders.","A systematic review of studies comparing the sensitivities and specificities of electrocardiogram and echo found that each was highly specific for the detection of LVH 77%-97%, but the sensitivity of echocardiography 88%-93% exceeded that of electrocardiogram 21%-54%. However, LVH detected by electrocardiogram is a better predictor of cardiovascular complications."
"Is there a well-tested tool to detect drug-seeking behaviors in chronic pain patients
Clinicians recognize the importance of monitoring aberrant medication-related behaviors of chronic pain patients while being prescribed opioid therapy. The purpose of this study was to develop and validate the Current Opioid Misuse Measure (COMM) for those pain patients already on long-term opioid therapy. An initial pool of 177 items was developed with input from 26 pain management and addiction specialists. Concept mapping identified six primary concepts underlying medication misuse, which were used to develop an initial item pool. Twenty-two pain and addiction specialists rated the items on importance and relevance, resulting in selection of a 40-item alpha COMM. Final item selection was based on empirical evaluation of items with patients taking opioids for chronic, noncancer pain (N=227). One-week test-retest reliability was examined with 55 participants. All participants were administered the alpha version of the COMM, the Prescription Drug Use Questionnaire (PDUQ) interview, and submitted a urine sample for toxicology screening. Physician ratings of patient aberrant behaviors were also obtained. Of the 40 items, 17 items appeared to adequately measure aberrant behavior, demonstrating excellent internal consistency and test-retest reliability. Cutoff scores were examined using ROC curve analysis and reasonable sensitivity and specificity were established. To evaluate the COMM's ability to capture change in patient status, it was tested on a subset of patients (N=86) that were followed and reassessed three months later. The COMM was found to have promise as a brief, self-report measure of current aberrant drug-related behavior. Further cross-validation and replication of these preliminary results is pending.","The Current Opioid Misuse Measure (COMM) is used to monitor aberrant behaviors in patients on opioid therapy. Scoring for the 17-item, self-administered test is similar to the SOAPP-R. In a study of 86 patients at a multidisciplinary pain center, a score of ≥9 detected opioid misuse with an LR- of 0.08 and an LR+ of 3.48, at a sensitivity of 77% and specificity of 66%."
"Is there a well-tested tool to detect drug-seeking behaviors in chronic pain patients
This study introduces the Addiction Behaviors Checklist (ABC), which is a brief (20-item) instrument designed to track behaviors characteristic of addiction related to prescription opioid medications in chronic pain populations. Items are focused on observable behaviors noted both during and between clinic visits. One hundred thirty-six consecutive veterans in a multidisciplinary Veterans Affairs Chronic Pain Clinic who were receiving long-term opioid medication treatment were included in this study. This study represents one of the first to follow a sample of chronic pain patients on opioid therapy over time, using a structured assessment tool to evaluate and track behaviors suggestive of addiction. Interrater reliability and concurrent validity data are presented, as well as a cut-off score for use in determining inappropriate medication use. The psychometric findings support the ABC as a viable assessment tool that can increase a provider's confidence in determinations of appropriate vs. inappropriate opioid use.",The ABC was tested in a population that was predominantly male.
"Does treatment of acne with Retin A and tetracycline cause adverse effects
We used information from the Group Health Cooperative of Puget Sound, Washington, USA, to evaluate the risk of birth defects in mothers exposed to topical tretinoin--a retinoid preparation used to treat acne--in the first trimester of pregnancy. We identified 215 women who delivered live or stillborn infants at Group Health Cooperative hospitals and who were exposed to topical tretinoin early in pregnancy, and 430 age-matched nonexposed women who delivered live or stillborn infants at the same hospitals. The prevalence of major anomalies among babies born to the exposed women was 1.9% and among babies born to the nonexposed women was 2.6%. The relative risk estimate for having a baby with a major congenital anomaly for exposed versus nonexposed women was 0.7 (95% CI 0.2-2.3). We conclude that topical tretinoin is not associated with an increased risk for major congenital disorders.","Topical tretinoin is not associated with an increased risk for major congenital disorders. A retrospective study of 215 women on tretinoin during the first trimester compared with 430 controls found that the relative risk for a major congenital anomaly was 0.7 (95% CI, 0.2-2.3).

"Which urinary tract infection therapies are safe and effective during breastfeeding
This is part of the series of practice guidelines commissioned by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) through its Practice Guidelines Committee. The purpose of this guideline is to provide assistance to clinicians in the diagnosis and treatment of two specific types of urinary tract infections (UTIs): uncomplicated, acute, symptomatic bacterial cystitis and acute pyelonephritis in women. The guideline does not contain recommendations for asymptomatic bacteriuria, complicated UTIs, Foley catheter-associated infections, UTIs in men or children, or prostatitis. The targeted providers are internists and family practitioners. The targeted groups are immunocompetent women. Criteria are specified for determining whether the inpatient or outpatient setting is appropriate for treatment. Differences from other guidelines written on this topic include use of laboratory criteria for diagnosis and approach to antimicrobial therapy. Panel members represented experts in adult infectious diseases and urology. The guidelines are evidence-based. A standard ranking system is used for the strength of the recommendation and the quality of the evidence cited in the literature reviewed. The document has been subjected to external review by peer reviewers as well as by the Practice Guidelines Committee and was approved by the IDSA Council, the sponsor and supporter of the guideline. The American Urologic Association and the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases have endorsed it. An executive summary and tables highlight the major recommendations. Performance measures are described to aid in monitoring compliance with the guideline. The guideline will be listed on the IDSA home page at http://www.idsociety.org It will be evaluated for updating in 2 years.","The best evidence for efficacy of urinary tract infection treatments comes from a 1999 meta-analysis of uncomplicated urinary tract infection in nonpregnant, nonlactating women. They found TMP/SMX to be the most widely studied antibiotic and to have a 93% bacterial eradication rate; it was therefore used as a standard for comparison of other treatments. Nitrofurantoin and quinolones (ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and others) had comparable eradication rates to TMP/SMX in the same study; 7-day courses of nitrofurantoin were more efficacious than shorter ones. Three-day therapy for uncomplicated urinary tract infection is more effective than single-dose therapy and equal to longer courses for most antibiotics. A longer course (7 days) may be required for nitrofurantoin."
"Does daily monitoring of blood glucose predict hemoglobin A1c levels
Recommendations exist that fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels can be substituted for glycosylated haemoglobin A1 (HbA1) in Type II diabetic subjects (DM II), which have potential important financial implications. The present study was designed to expand this examination and to include Type I DM (DMI) patients and random blood glucose (RBG) values. Data were obtained from 234 DM II and 104 DM I patients, over 3 years. Correlation of HbA1 with FPG levels in DM II yielded an r value of 0.61. Correlation of HbA1 with RBG and 2 h post prandial glucose measurements yielded r values of 0.59 and 0.51 respectively, p < 0.001. In DM I, similar correlations gave r values ranging between 0.27 and 0.38, p < 0.01-0.001. Thus while significant correlations exist between HbA1 and FPG and RBG measurements in both DM I and DM II, clinically applicable information on long-term diabetic control can only be achieved from glucose measurements in DM II but the correlation is not sufficiently tight to recommend substitution of plasma glucose for HbA1 determinations, despite the cost advantages.",One study compared patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes and found a higher correlation between blood glucose and HbA1c levels in the latter.
"What treatment works best for tennis elbow
Lateral epicondylitis is generally treated with corticosteroid injections or physiotherapy. Dutch clinical guidelines recommend a wait-and-see policy. We compared the efficacy of these approaches. Patients with lateral epicondylitis of at least 6 weeks' duration were recruited by family doctors. We randomly allocated eligible patients to 6 weeks of treatment with corticosteroid injections, physiotherapy, or a wait-and-see policy. Outcome measures included general improvement, severity of the main complaint, pain, elbow disability, and patient satisfaction. Severity of elbow complaints, grip strength, and pressure pain threshold were assessed by a research physiotherapist who was unaware of treatment allocation. We assessed all outcomes at 3, 6, 12, 26, and 52 weeks. The principal analysis was done on an intention-to-treat basis. We randomly assigned 185 patients. At 6 weeks, corticosteroid injections were significantly better than all other therapy options for all outcome measures. Success rates were 92% (57) compared with 47% (30) for physiotherapy and 32% (19) for wait-and-see policy. However, recurrence rate in the injection group was high. Long-term differences between injections and physiotherapy were significantly in favour of physiotherapy. Success rates at 52 weeks were 69% (43) for injections, 91% (58) for physiotherapy, and 83% (49) for a wait-and-see policy. Physiotherapy had better results than a wait-and-see policy, but differences were not significant. Patients should be properly informed about the advantages and disadvantages of the treatment options for lateral epicondylitis. The decision to treat with physiotherapy or to adopt a wait-and-see policy might depend on available resources, since the relative gain of physiotherapy is small.","I a randomized study with 3 treatment arms, 185 patients were treated with a corticosteroid injection, physiotherapy, or a wait-and-see approach (ergonomic advice, rest, and oral anti-inflammatory medication). Corticosteroid injections were significantly more effective for the patients' main complaint at 6 weeks compared with wait-and-see (mean difference in improvement [MDI] on a 100-point scale=24; 95% CI, 14-35; NNT=2) or physiotherapy (MDI=20; 95% CI, 10-31; NNT=2). By contrast, at 26 and 52 weeks' follow-up, physiotherapy was more effective than steroid injections (MDI=15; 95% CI, 5-25) but statistically equivalent to a wait-and-see approach (MDI=7; 95% CI, -4 to 17)."
"What's the most effective treatment for giardiasis
There can be a high rate of recurrence of disease after initial drug treatment for giardiasis. These drugs also have a range of adverse effects. The objective of this review was to assess the effects of drug treatments for giardiasis. We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group trials register, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, Medline and Embase, Current Contents, reference lists of articles. Randomised and quasi-randomised trials of drug therapy for giardiasis compared with placebo or another drug. Two reviewers independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Thirty-four trials were included. Only one trial was without serious methodological flaws. Compared with placebo, drug treatment was associated with an improved cure rate (odds ratio 11.5, 95% confidence interval 2.3 to 58). Metronidazole treatment longer than three days had a better parasitological cure rate than other long treatment courses (odds ratio 2.4, 95% confidence interval 1.3 to 4.4), but there was significant heterogeneity between the trials. Single dose therapy appeared equally effective as longer treatment courses (odds ratio 0.33, 95% confidence interval 0.08 to 1.34). Within the single dose regimens, tinidazole had a comparable parasitological cure rate to other short therapies (odds ratio 3.4, 95% confidence interval 0.95 to 12), but had a higher clinical cure rate (odds ratio 5.3, 95% 2.7-10.7). A single dose of tinidazole appears to give the highest clinical cure rate for giardiasis with relatively few adverse effects.","A 2006 Cochrane Review compared 34 trials of many drug therapies for giardiasis. The review, which is being updated to include additional publications, evaluated both head-to-head and placebo-controlled studies, looking at dosage as well as length of drug therapy. The review found that a single dose of tinidazole had a higher clinical cure rate than other therapies such as metronidazole (odds ratio [OR]=5.33; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.66-10.67) along with a comparable side-effect profile. These findings favor tinidazole as the treatment of choice for symptomatic giardiasis."
"What is the best way to distinguish type 1 and 2 diabetes
Differentiation between Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes in adults is difficult at diagnosis. In this study we tested the hypothesis that autoantibodies at diagnosis are predictive for insulin treatment within 3 years in patients initially not classified as Type 1 diabetes. In a nationwide population-based study, blood samples were obtained from 764 patients, all diagnosed with diabetes during a 2-year period. At diagnosis, 583 (76%) were classified as Type 1, 110 (14%) as Type 2 and 71 (9.3%) could not be classified. Among patients not classified as Type 1 diabetes, 52 (47%) of Type 2 and 42 (59%) of unclassified patients were positive for islet cell antibodies (ICA), glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies (GADA) or tyrosine phosphatase antibodies (IA-2A). These patients (n=94) had lower body mass index (BMI) (p<0.001) and lower C-peptide (p<0.001) compared to the autoantibody negative patients (n=87). Compared to clinically classified Type 1 diabetes patients positive for autoantibodies (n=477), they have higher BMI (p<0.001), higher C-peptide (p<0.001) and the same levels of ICA, GADA and IA-2A. After 3 years, 93% of autoantibody positive patients initially not classified as Type 1 were on insulin. When ICA, GADA, IA-2A, BMI and C-peptide were tested in a multiple logistic regression, only GADA was significant for insulin treatment within 3 years (OR=18.8; 95% CI 1.8-191) in patients treated with diet or oral drugs at diagnosis. A correct classification is difficult in adult diabetic patients. The presence of pancreatic autoantibodies, especially GADA, at diagnosis of diabetes are highly predictive for insulin therapy within 3 years from diagnosis.","A study in young adults with type 2 or unclassified diabetes from Sweden found 93% of patients who were GADAb+ required insulin at 3 years, compared with 51% who were GADAb-(OR=18.8; 95% CI, 1.8-191)."
"Does glucosamine relieve arthritis joint pain
Glucosamine products have been used extensively for the management of pain in osteoarthritis (OA). We investigated the efficacy of the hydrochloride salt of glucosamine on pain and disability in knee OA. At Week -2, subjects were examined, randomized, and instructed to take only prescribed acetaminophen for pain. At Week 0 patients were examined, prescribed acetaminophen, and either placebo or glucosamine hydrochloride (glucosamine). At Week 4 the prescriptions for acetaminophen and placebo or glucosamine were renewed. At Weeks 4 and 8, patients returned diaries and unused medications, and were examined. The WOMAC questionnaire was administered at Weeks -2, 0, and 8. After completing the randomized 8 week trial, subjects were offered known glucosamine hydrochloride capsules in an 8 week open label trial, with followup telephone survey after the 8 week open label trial. The primary endpoint (statistically significant difference in WOMAC pain score between Week 0 and Week 8) was not met. However, positive trends were noted for the glucosamine group in 23 of 24 WOMAC questions. A significant difference was noted from Week 5 through Week 8 in the knee examination (p = 0.026) and in the response to a daily diary pain question (p = 0.018). However, responding to the question, ""Are you better than at the start of the trial?"", 40% of placebo and only 49% of glucosamine subjects answered in the affirmative (p = 0.58). At the end of the randomized trial, 34% of placebo and 47% of glucosamine subjects believed that they had been given glucosamine. After the end of the 8 week open label trial, 77% of the subjects were still taking glucosamine, although now obliged to pay for commercially available products. There was no significant difference in pain reduction between the glucosamine hydrochloride and placebo groups as measured by WOMAC. However, the secondary endpoints of cumulative pain reduction as measured by daily diary and knee examination were favorable, suggesting that glucosamine hydrochloride benefits some patients with knee OA.",Statistically significant differences exist in some subgroup analyses and secondary endpoints.
"Which tests are the most useful for diagnosing pelvic inflammatory disease
To critically evaluate the available evidence base concerned with the diagnosis of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) based on clinical presentation, and to investigate the relation between signs and symptoms and the presence of laparoscopically diagnosed PID using the largest available dataset. The evidence base was critically evaluated and data collected by Lund University between 1960 and 1969 were used to compare clinical presentation with the results of laparoscopic investigation. Three techniques were used in this investigation-sensitivity and specificity, likelihood ratios, and discriminant analysis. None of the variables (abnormal vaginal discharge, fever >38 degrees C, vomiting, menstrual irregularity, ongoing bleeding, symptoms of urethritis, rectal temperature >38 degrees C, marked tenderness of pelvic organs on bimanual examination, adnexal mass, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate >or=15 mm in the first hour) had both high specificity and sensitivity-most had low specificity and sensitivity. There was little variation in either the likelihood ratios or the post-test probabilities between the variables. The lowest likelihood ratio (0.97) produced a post-test probability of 78% (95% CI: 74% to 81%) whereas the highest (1.73) had a post-test probability of 84% (95% CI: 81% to 87%). The pretest probability of having PID based on the presence of lower abdominal pain was 79% (95% CI: 76% to 82%). The discriminant analysis indicated that three variables significantly influenced the prediction of the presence of PID: erythrocyte sedimentation rate (p<0.0001), fever (p<0.0001), and adnexal tenderness (p<0.0001). These variables correctly classified 65% of patients with laparoscopically diagnosed PID (95% CI: 61% to 69%). There is insufficient evidence to support existing diagnostic criteria, which have been based on a combination of empirical data and expert opinion. A new evidence base is urgently needed but this will require either a new investigation of the association between clinical presentation and PID based on a laparoscopic ""gold standard"" or the development of new diagnostic techniques.","The Lund analysis includes data collected between 1960 and 1969 at Lund University Hospital in Sweden on women with suspected PID, with about 625 cases included for these analyses. Simms et al found insufficient evidence from these data for any existing diagnostic criteria."
"What hormonal contraception is most effective for obese wome
To estimate the effect of body mass index (BMI) and weight on risk of pregnancy while using oral contraceptives (OCs). We conducted a case-control study of 248 health maintenance organization enrollees who became pregnant while using OCs between 1998 and 2001 and 533 age-matched enrollees who were nonpregnant OC users during the same period. Using logistic regression we calculated adjusted odds ratios (ORs) to estimate the risk of pregnancy according to BMI and weight quartile. Among all OC users, when compared with women having a BMI of 27.3 or less, the risk of pregnancy was nearly 60% higher in women with BMI greater than 27.3 (OR 1.58, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.11-2.24) and over 70% higher in women with BMI greater than 32.2 (OR 1.72, 95% CI 1.04-2.82). Among consistent users (women who missed no pills in reference month), the risk of pregnancy was more than doubled in women with BMI greater than 27.3 (OR 2.17, 95% CI 1.38-3.41) or BMI greater than 32.2 (OR 2.22, 95% CI 1.18-4.20). When compared with women weighing 74.8 kg or less, among consistent OC users the risk of pregnancy was over 70% higher in women weighing more than 74.8 kg (OR 1.71, 95% CI 1.08-2.71) and nearly doubled in women weighing more than 86.2 kg (OR 1.95, 95% CI 1.06-3.67). Our results suggest that being overweight may increase the risk of becoming pregnant while using OCs. If causal, this association translates to an additional 2-4 pregnancies per 100 woman-years of use among overweight women, for whom consideration of additional or effective alternative contraceptive methods may be warranted.","A follow-up case-control study demonstrated that the risk of pregnancy for consistent pill users doubled for women with a body mass index >27.3 (odds ratio [OR]=2.17; 95% CI, 1.38-3.41); results were similar for those with a body mass index >32.2 (OR=2.2; 95% CI, 1.18-4.20)."
"Which drugs are most effective for moderate to severe depression in adolescents
The efficacy, safety, and tolerability of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in the treatment of adults with major depressive disorder (MDD) are well established. Comparatively few data are available on the effects of SSRIs in depressed children and adolescents. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of sertraline compared with placebo in treatment of pediatric patients with MDD. Two multicenter randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials were conducted at 53 hospital, general practice, and academic centers in the United States, India, Canada, Costa Rica, and Mexico between December 1999 and May 2001 and were pooled a priori. Three hundred seventy-six children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition-defined MDD of at least moderate severity. Patients were randomly assigned to receive a flexible dosage (50-200 mg/d) of sertraline (n = 189) or matching placebo tablets (n = 187) for 10 weeks. Change from baseline in the Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised (CDRS-R) Best Description of Child total score and reported adverse events. Sertraline-treated patients experienced statistically significantly greater improvement than placebo patients on the CDRS-R total score (mean change at week 10, -30.24 vs -25.83, respectively; P =.001; overall mean change, -22.84 vs -20.19, respectively; P =.007). Based on a 40% decrease in the adjusted CDRS-R total score at study end point, 69% of sertraline-treated patients compared with 59% of placebo patients were considered responders (P =.05). Sertraline treatment was generally well tolerated. Seventeen sertraline-treated patients (9%) and 5 placebo patients (3%) prematurely discontinued the study because of adverse events. Adverse events that occurred in at least 5% of sertraline-treated patients and with an incidence of at least twice that in placebo patients included diarrhea, vomiting, anorexia, and agitation. The results of this pooled analysis demonstrate that sertraline is an effective and well-tolerated short-term treatment for children and adolescents with MDD.","Two RCTs showed that sertraline was slightly, but statistically significantly, better than placebo when the 2 identically designed trials were combined."
"How should you further evaluate an adult with a testicular mass
The diagnostic results of clinical examination and gray-scale ultrasonography for scrotal pathology were compared in 411 patients. Sensitivity and specificity of the clinical diagnosis of a testis tumor improved significantly with the use of ultrasonography. Criteria for the ultrasonographic diagnosis of a testicular tumor were evaluated. We had no false-negative ultrasonographic diagnoses, and they have rarely been reported in the literature. With ultrasonography, the number of false-positive clinical diagnoses was reduced from 11 to 5.","In a small study comparing clinical exam with ultrasound for diagnosis of testicular tumor, the negative predictive value of ultrasound was 100%."
"How does venous thromboembolism risk for the patch and vaginal ring compare with oral contraceptives
To review evidence on the combined hormonal patch, combined hormonal vaginal ring and the etonogestrel implant, with a focus on safety and effectiveness of use among women with special health conditions, we searched MEDLINE, Pre-MEDLINE and the Cochrane Library for reports published from 1980 through March 2005. Articles eligible for review included 11 on the hormonal patch, nine on the hormonal ring, and 11 on the etonogestrel implant. Limited evidence suggests patch efficacy is lower among women>90 kg. No evidence was identified for vaginal ring use among women with medical conditions. A single small study found that etonogestrel implants had no adverse effects on bone mineral density among women 18-40 years old. Limited evidence also suggests no adverse effects of the etonogestrel implant on lactation parameters or infant development among users enrolled 28 to 56 days postpartum and followed for 4 months.",NuvaRing users experienced similar side effects compared with oral contraceptive users.
"How effective are lifestyle changes for controlling hypertension
Many randomised trials assessing the effect of salt reduction on blood pressure show reduction in blood pressure in individuals with high blood pressure. However, there is controversy about the magnitude and the clinical significance of the fall in blood pressure in individuals with normal blood pressure. Several meta-analyses of randomised salt reduction trials have been published in the last few years. However, most of these included trials of very short duration (e.g. 5 days) and included trials with salt loading followed by salt deprivation (e.g. from 20 to 1 g/day) over only a few days. These short-term experiments are not appropriate to inform public health policy which is for a modest reduction in salt intake over a prolonged period of time. A meta-analysis by Hooper et al is an important attempt to look at whether advice to achieve a long-term salt reduction (i.e. more than 6 months) in randomised trials causes a fall in blood pressure. However, most trials included in this meta-analysis achieved a small reduction in salt intake; on average, salt intake was reduced by 2 g/day. It is, therefore, not surprising that this analysis showed a small fall in blood pressure, and that a dose-response to salt reduction was not demonstrable. To assess the effect of the currently recommended modest reduction in salt intake (WHO 2003; SACN 2003; Whelton 2002), on blood pressure in individuals with normal and elevated blood pressure. To assess whether the magnitude of the reduction in blood pressure is dependent on the magnitude of the reduction in salt intake. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane library, CINAHL, and reference list of original and review articles. We included randomised trials with a modest reduction in salt intake and a duration of 4 or more weeks. Data were extracted independently by two persons. Mean effect sizes were calculated using both fixed and random effect models using Review Manager 4.2.1 software. Weighted linear regression was used to examine the relationship between the change in urinary sodium and the change in blood pressure. We used funnel plots to detect publication and other biases in the meta-analysis. Seventeen trials in individuals with elevated blood pressure (n=734) and 11 trials in individuals with normal blood pressure (n=2220) were included. In individuals with elevated blood pressure the median reduction in 24-h urinary sodium excretion was 78 mmol (4.6 g/day of salt), the mean reduction in systolic blood pressure was -4.97 mmHg (95%CI:-5.76 to -4.18), and the mean reduction in diastolic blood pressure was -2.74 mmHg (95% CI:-3.22 to -2.26). In individuals with normal blood pressure the median reduction in 24-h urinary sodium excretion was 74 mmol (4.4 g/day of salt), the mean reduction in systolic blood pressure was -2.03 mmHg (95% CI: -2.56 to -1.50) mmHg, and the mean reduction in diastolic blood pressure was -0.99 mmHg (-1.40 to -0.57). Weighted linear regression analyses showed a correlation between the reduction in urinary sodium and the reduction in blood pressure. Our meta-analysis demonstrates that a modest reduction in salt intake for a duration of 4 or more weeks has a significant and, from a population viewpoint, important effect on blood pressure in both individuals with normal and elevated blood pressure. These results support other evidence suggesting that a modest and long-term reduction in population salt intake could reduce strokes, heart attacks, and heart failure. Furthermore, our meta-analysis demonstrates a correlation between the magnitude of salt reduction and the magnitude of blood pressure reduction. Within the daily intake range of 3 to 12 g/day, the lower the salt intake achieved, the lower the blood pressure.","A Cochrane review of 17 trials with 734 participants concluded that for individuals with hypertension, a reduced-salt diet results in a mean systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure reductions of 5 mm Hg and 3 mm Hg, respectively."
"Can you differentiate bacterial from viral pediatric infections based on the CBC
To develop an improved model for the prediction of bacteremia in young febrile children. A retrospective review was performed on patients 3 to 36 months of age seen in a children's hospital emergency department between December 1995 and September 1997 who had a complete blood count and blood culture ordered as part of their regular care. Exclusion criteria included current use of antibiotics or any immunodeficient state. Clinical and laboratory parameters reviewed included age, gender, race, weight, temperature, presence of focal bacterial infection, white blood cell count (WBC), polymorphonuclear cell count (PMN), band count, and absolute neutrophil count (ANC). Logistic regression analyses were used to identify factors associated with bacteremia, defined as growth of a pathogen in a blood culture. The model that was developed was then validated on a second dataset consisting of febrile patients 3 to 36 months of age collected from a second children's hospital (validation set). There were 633 patients in the derivation set (46 bacteremic) and 9465 patients in the validation set (149 bacteremic). The mean age of patients in the derivation and validation sets were 15.8 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 15.2-16.5) and 16.6 months (95% CI: 16.5-16.8), respectively; the mean temperatures were 39.1 degrees C (95% CI: 39. 0-39.2) and 39.8 degrees C (95% CI: 39.7-39.8); 56% were male in the derivation set and 55% male in the validation set. Predictors of bacteremia identified by logistic regression included ANC, WBC, PMN, temperature, and gender. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis showed similar performance of ANC and WBC as predictors of bacteremia. When placed into a multivariate logistic regression model, band count was not significantly associated with bacteremia. Information regarding focal infection was available for 572 patients in the derivation set. The percentage of patients diagnosed with bacteremia with a focal bacterial infection was not significantly different from the percentage who had bacteremia without a focal bacterial infection (16/200 vs 30/372). Based on this dataset, a logistic regression formula was developed that could be used to develop a unique risk value for each patient based on temperature, gender, and ANC. When the final model was applied to the validation set, the area under the ROC curve (AUC) constructed from these data indicated that the model retained good predictive value (AUC for the derivation vs validation data =.8348 vs 0.8221, respectively). Use of the formulas derived here allows the clinician to estimate a child's risk for bacteremia based on temperature, ANC, and gender. This approach offers a useful alternative to predictions based on fever and WBC alone.bacteremia, detection, white blood cell.","A retrospective review of more than 10,000 patients aged 3 to 36 months presenting to the emergency department used logistic regression to identify predictors of bacteremia. In this study, ANC (>9500/mm3) and white blood cells (>14,300/mm3) were of equal sensitivity (75%) and specificity (75%) in identifying serious bacterial infection."
"Can recombinant growth hormone effectively treat idiopathic short stature
Idiopathic short stature (ISS) refers to children who are very short compared with their peers for unknown or hereditary reasons. Recombinant human growth hormone has been used to increase growth and final height in children with idiopathic short stature. To assess the effects of recombinant human growth hormone on short-term growth and final height in children with idiopathic short stature. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were sought by searching The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Medline, Embase, PubMed, Science Citation Index, BIOSIS and Current Controlled Trials (date of last search 10 December 2002). Article reference lists were assessed for trials and experts and pharmaceutical companies were contacted. Randomised controlled trials were included if they were carried out in children with ISS with normal growth hormone secretion. Growth hormone (GH) had to be administered for a minimum of six months and be compared with placebo or no treatment. A growth or height outcome measure had to be assessed. Two reviewers assessed studies for inclusion criteria and for methodological quality. Data were extracted by one reviewer and checked by a second. The primary outcome was final height and secondary outcomes included short term growth, health related quality of life and adverse effects. To estimate summary treatment effects, data were pooled, when appropriate using a random effects model. Nine randomised controlled trials were included. One trial reported near final height in girls and found that girls treated with growth hormone were 7.5 cm taller than untreated controls (GH group, 155.3 cm +/- 6.4; control, 147.8 cm +/- 2.6; p = 0.003). The other trials reported short term outcomes. Results suggest that short-term height gains can range from none to approximately 0.7 SD over one year. One study reported health related quality of life and showed no significant improvement in growth hormone treated children compared with those in the control group. No serious adverse effects of treatment have been reported. Results suggest that growth hormone therapy can increase short-term growth and improve (near) final height. Increases in height are such that treated individuals remain relatively short when compared with peers of normal stature. Further research in the form of large, multicentre RCTs are required. These should focus on final height, which is the best outcome for assessing the effects of growth hormone, and address quality of life and cost issues.",Final height is arguably the most important outcome measure for the effects of rGH and may be represented as actual height or as a standard deviation score (SDS)-actual height minus mean height for age divided by standard deviation of height for age. This measure standardizes height comparisons for different age groups and is comparable to the percentile values on growth charts.
"Does tight control of blood glucose in pregnant women with diabetes improve neonatal outcomes
Pregnancies complicated by pre-existing insulin dependent diabetes are high risk for a number of poor pregnancy and neonatal outcomes. The objective of this review was to assess the effects of very tight glycaemic control in established insulin dependence. The Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group trials register was searched. Randomised trials comparing very tight with tight control of diabetes in pregnancy. One reviewer assessed trial quality and extracted data. Two trials involving 182 women were involved. The two trials were difficult to compare. Maternal hypoglycaemia was more common among women whose diabetic control was very tight compared to tight control (odds ratio 25.96, 95% confidence interval 4.91 to 137.26) based on one trial. There was no difference detected in perinatal outcome between the groups. There appears to be no clear evidence of benefit from very tight glycaemic control for pregnant diabetic women. Since very strict control may have a substantial impact on lifestyle, this suggests caution in advising such a degree of control.","When tight and very tight control of glucose in pregnant women with pregestational diabetes were compared in a Cochrane systematic review, rates of maternal hypoglycemia in the very tightly controlled group were higher (odds ratio [OR]=25.96; 95% CI, 4.91-137.26). An randomized controlled trials of 118 women with pregestational diabetes compared 4-times-daily vs twice-daily doses of insulin. Infants born to women receiving 4-times-daily insulin had significantly lower rates of neonatal hypoglycemia (RR=0.17; 95% CI, 0.04-0.74). While the trend was toward improved neonatal metabolic effects in the trials, the clinical significance of these findings is not clear."
"Does screening reduce lung cancer mortality
The outcome among patients with clinical stage I cancer that is detected on annual screening using spiral computed tomography (CT) is unknown. In a large collaborative study, we screened 31,567 asymptomatic persons at risk for lung cancer using low-dose CT from 1993 through 2005, and from 1994 through 2005, 27,456 repeated screenings were performed 7 to 18 months after the previous screening. We estimated the 10-year lung-cancer-specific survival rate among participants with clinical stage I lung cancer that was detected on CT screening and diagnosed by biopsy, regardless of the type of treatment received, and among those who underwent surgical resection of clinical stage I cancer within 1 month. A pathology panel reviewed the surgical specimens obtained from participants who underwent resection. Screening resulted in a diagnosis of lung cancer in 484 participants. Of these participants, 412 (85%) had clinical stage I lung cancer, and the estimated 10-year survival rate was 88% in this subgroup (95% confidence interval [CI], 84 to 91). Among the 302 participants with clinical stage I cancer who underwent surgical resection within 1 month after diagnosis, the survival rate was 92% (95% CI, 88 to 95). The 8 participants with clinical stage I cancer who did not receive treatment died within 5 years after diagnosis. Annual spiral CT screening can detect lung cancer that is curable.","A 2006 study followed a cohort of at-risk patients using low-dose computerized tomography screening. There were 31,567 patients evaluated initially, of which 27,456 had an annual repeat screening. Most patients were current or former smokers (83%); patients with exposure to occupational and secondhand smoke were also included. A positive initial screen was defined as a solid or partly solid noncalcified nodule ≥5 mm in diameter; a nonsolid, noncalcified nodule ≥8 mm in diameter; or a solid endobronchial nodule. A positive screen during follow-up was defined as any new noncalcified nodule, regardless of size. Positive tests occurred in 13% of baseline screens and 5% of annual screens. Biopsies were performed according to a study protocol based on a nodule's size and behavior over time. Out of a total of 5646 positive screens, there were 535 biopsies, and a diagnosis of cancer in 492 patients. Of those with cancer, 412 (84%) had clinical stage I lung cancer; the authors estimated their 10-year survival rate was 88% (95% CI, 84%-91%). If patients with stage I disease underwent surgical resection within 1 month of diagnosis, their estimated 10-year survival increased to 92% (95% CI, 88%-95%)."
"What is the most effective treatment for acute low back pain
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are the most frequently prescribed medications worldwide and are widely used for patients with low back pain. The objective of this systematic review was to assess the effects of NSAIDs in the treatment of non-specific low back pain and to assess which type of NSAID is most effective. We searched the Medline and Embase databases and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (CCTR) up to and including September 1998 if reported in English, Dutch or German. We also screened references given in relevant reviews and identified trials. Randomised trials and double-blind controlled trials of NSAIDs in non-specific low back pain with or without radiation were included. Two reviewers blinded with respect to authors, institution and journal independently extracted data and assessed methodological quality. A methodological quality score was applied, and studies meeting at least six of 11 specified criteria were considered high quality studies. If data were considered clinically homogeneous, a meta-analysis was performed using a fixed effects model for statistically homogeneous subgroups and a random effects model for statistically heterogeneous subgroups. If data were considered clinically heterogeneous, a qualitative analysis was performed using a rating system with four levels of evidence (strong, moderate, limited, no). A total of 51 trials (total number of patients = 6057) were included in this review, of which 46 were published in English and five in German. Sixteen trials (31%) were of high quality. The pooled Relative Risk for global improvement after one week was 1.24 (95% CI 1.10, 1.41) and for additional analgesic use 1.29 (95% CI 1.05, 1.57), indicating a statistically significant effect in favour of NSAIDs compared to placebo. The results of the qualitative analysis showed that there is conflicting evidence (level 3) that NSAIDs are more effective than paracetamol for acute low back pain, and that there is moderate evidence (level 2) that NSAIDs are not more effective than other drugs for acute low back pain. There is strong evidence (level 1) that various types of NSAIDs are equally effective for acute low back pain. In conclusion, the evidence from the 51 trials included in this review suggests that NSAIDs are effective for short-term symptomatic relief in patients with acute low back pain. Furthermore, there does not seem to be a specific type of NSAID which is clearly more effective than others. Sufficient evidence on chronic low back pain is still lacking.",There is no statistically significant difference in pain relief between patients using NSAIDs alone versus those using both NSAIDs and muscle relaxants.1 The use of muscle relaxants was associated with more adverse reactions than placebo (53% vs 28%; number needed to harm [NNH] = 4).
"Do glucosamine and chondroitin worsen blood sugar control in diabetes
Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis, and it is often associated with significant disability and an impaired quality of life. To review all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the effectiveness and toxicity of glucosamine in OA. We searched MEDLINE, PREMEDLINE, EMBASE, AMED, ACP Journal Club, DARE, CDSR, and the CCTR. We also wrote letters to content experts, and hand searched reference lists of identified RCTs and pertinent review articles. All searches were updated in January 2005. Relevant studies met the following criteria: 1) RCTs evaluating the effectiveness and safety of glucosamine in OA, 2) Both placebo controlled and comparative studies were eligible, 3) Both single blinded and double blinded studies were eligible. Data abstraction was performed independently by two investigators and the results were compared for degree of agreement. Gotzsche's method and a validated tool (Jadad 1996) were used to score the quality of the RCTs. Continuous outcome measures were pooled using standardized mean differences (SMD) as the measure of effect size. Dichotomous outcome measures were pooled using relative risk ratios (RR). Analysis restricted to eight studies with adequate allocation concealment failed to show benefit of glucosamine for pain and WOMAC function. Collectively, the 20 analyzed RCTs found glucosamine favoured placebo with a 28% (change from baseline) improvement in pain (SMD -0.61, 95% CI -0.95, -0.28) and a 21% (change from baseline) improvement in function using the Lequesne index (SMD -0.51 95% CI -0.96, -0.05). However, the results are not uniformly positive, and the reasons for this remain unexplained. WOMAC pain, function and stiffness outcomes did not reach statistical significance. In the 10 RCTs in which the Rotta preparation of glucosamine was compared to placebo, glucosamine was found to be superior for pain (SMD -1.31, 95% CI -1.99, -0.64) and function using the Lequesne index (SMD -0.51, 95% CI -0.96, -0.05). Pooled results for pain (SMD -0.15, 95% CI -0.35, 0.05) and function using the WOMAC index (SMD 0.03, 95% CI -0.18, 0.25) in those RCTs in which a non-Rotta preparation of glucosamine was compared to placebo did not reach statistical significance. In the four RCTs in which the Rotta preparation of glucosamine was compared to an NSAID, glucosamine was superior in two, and equivalent in two. Two RCTs using the Rotta preparation showed that glucosamine was able to slow radiological progression of OA of the knee over a three year period (SMD 0.24, 95% CI 0.04, 0.43). Glucosamine was as safe as placebo in terms of the number of subjects reporting adverse reactions (RR=0.97, 95% CI, 0.88, 1.08). This update includes 20 studies with 2570 patients. Pooled results from studies using a non-Rotta preparation or adequate allocation concealment failed to show benefit in pain and WOMAC function while those studies evaluating the Rotta preparation show that glucosamine was superior to placebo in the treatment of pain and functional impairment resulting from symptomatic OA. WOMAC outcomes of pain, stiffness and function did not show a superiority of glucosamine over placebo for both Rotta and non-Rotta preparations of glucosamine. Glucosamine was as safe as placebo.","A Cochrane systematic review of 20 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) including 2570 patients in order to evaluate the effectiveness and toxicity of glucosamine in osteoarthritis found that glucosamine was as safe as placebo in terms of adverse reactions. However, they did not comment specifically on diabetic patients or hyperglycemia per se."
"How should you evaluate elevated calcium in an asymptomatic patient
In the United States, most patients with primary hyperparathyroidism have few or no symptoms. The need for parathyroidectomy to treat all patients with this disorder has therefore been questioned. We studied the clinical course and development of complications for periods of up to 10 years in 121 patients with primary hyperparathyroidism, 101 (83 percent) of whom were asymptomatic. There were 30 men and 91 women (age range, 20 to 79 years). During the study, 61 patients (50 percent) underwent parathyroidectomy, and 60 patients were followed without surgery. Parathyroidectomy in patients with or without symptoms led to normalization of serum calcium concentrations and a mean (+/-SE) increase in lumbar-spine bone mineral density of 8+/-2 percent after 1 year (P=0.005) and 12+/-3 percent after 10 years (P=0.03). Bone mineral density of the femoral neck increased 6+/-1 percent after 1 year (P=0.002) and 14+/-4 percent after 10 years (P=0.002). Bone mineral density of the radius did not change significantly. The 52 asymptomatic patients who did not undergo surgery had no change in serum calcium concentration, urinary calcium excretion, or bone mineral density. However, 14 of these 52 patients (27 percent) had progression of disease, defined as the development of at least one new indication for parathyroidectomy. All 20 patients with symptoms had kidney stones. None of the 12 who underwent parathyroidectomy had recurrent kidney stones, whereas 6 of the 8 patients who did not undergo surgery did have a recurrence. In patients with primary hyperparathyroidism, parathyroidectomy results in the normalization of biochemical values and increased bone mineral density. Most asymptomatic patients who did not undergo surgery did not have progression of disease, but approximately one quarter of them did have some progression.","A 10-year prospective cohort study of patients with primary hyperparathyroidism found that 21% of asymptomatic patients developed decreased bone density at one or more sites. None acquired kidney stones, but hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria did worsen in 10 of 52 patients."
"What is the most effective treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in children
To obtain estimates of the relative efficacy of 3 main treatment strategies for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children and youth (age < 18 years). Design: quantitative systematic review of randomized trials. Subjects: 999 patients with ADHD from 26 randomized trials. Interventions: medications alone, behavioural interventions alone, and a combination of these 2 modalities. Main outcome measure: differences in scores between treatment groups on commonly used teacher- and parent-completed behaviour rating scales. Medication-only therapy was efficacious in ADHD. Behavioural therapies used alone appeared not to be efficacious in ADHD. Combination therapy was more efficacious than placebo or no treatment for parent but not teacher ratings, not more efficacious than drug therapy alone, and more efficacious than behavioural treatments alone based on parent but not teacher ratings. Though stimulant medications were found to be an effective treatment strategy for ADHD in children and youth, it proved difficult to assess the relative benefits of behavioural interventions alone and combined medication and behavioural therapy because of the paucity of treatment studies other than medication-only treatment studies and heterogeneity of various kinds that exist in relation to ADHD studies and treatments.","A fortyyear review looked at 135 trials and 413 RCTs of methylphenidate in over 19,000 children with an average age of 8.8 years (range, 8.3-9.4 years) for an average duration of 6 weeks (range, 3.3-8.0 weeks). Study groups included mostly elementary school-aged male children, with few minorities represented. Comorbid conditions, present in 65% of children with ADHD, were often poorly controlled. Outcome measures varied among studies. The effect size from stimulant medication in these studies averaged 0.8 for symptom relief and between 0.4 and 0.5 for academic achievement. (Effect size is the difference between the means of the experimental and control groups expressed in standard deviations. An effect size of 0.2 is considered small, 0.5 is medium, and 0.8 is considered moderate to large.)"
"Does stopping a statin increase the short-term risk of a cardiovascular event
In addition to lowering lipid profile, statins have pleiotropic effects on improving vascular function. Changes of these pleiotropic effects and their relationship to lipid profile after withdrawal of statin treatment remained unclear. We investigated the changes of lipid profile and plasma concentrations of human soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1) and human tissue type plasminogen activator (tPA) after withdrawal of statin treatment. Twenty-two patients (14 F, 8 M, aged 63+/-13 years) with hypercholesterolemia were treated with atorvastatin (ATOR; 10 mg/day) for 12 weeks. Blood samplings for serum lipid and markers were collected before, after and withdrawal of statin treatment. The total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and sVCAM-1 (from 394.4+/-251.7 to 321.0+/-198.9 ng/ml, p<0.05) all decreased significantly and the tPA (from 9.47+/-3.57 to 11.62+/-3.99 ng/ml, p<0.05) increased significantly after atorvastatin treatment. During the following 3 days after withdrawal of atorvastatin, the total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol did not show any significant change. However, the plasma sVCAM-1 significantly elevated on day 2 (from 321.0+/-198.9 to 371.2+/-220.4 ng/ml, p<0.05) and the plasma tPA significantly decreased on day 1 (from 11.62+/-3.99 to 10.52+/-3.55 ng/ml, p<0.05) and day 3 (from 11.62+/-3.99 to 10.27+/-3.69 ng/ml, p<0.05). Both the significant elevation of sVCAM-1 and decrease of tPA after withdrawal of atorvastatin treatment occurred within 3 days, while the serum cholesterol and LDL-chol levels did not have any significant change and were still within the therapeutic range. After 12 weeks of atorvastatin treatment, the beneficial pleiotropic effects can be demonstrated simultaneously with lowering the lipid profile. However, after withdrawal of atorvastatin, the beneficial pleiotropic effects are abrogated rapidly within days and are independent on elevation of serum cholesterol.","Tissue plasminogen activator levels are decreased after discontinuation of statins, resulting in a relatively hypercoagulable state."
"Is osteoporosis screening in postmenopausal women effective
To determine the ability of measurements of bone density in women to predict later fractures. Meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies published between 1985 and end of 1994 with a baseline measurement of bone density in women and subsequent follow up for fractures. For comparative purposes, we also reviewed case control studies of hip fractures published between 1990 and 1994. Eleven separate study populations with about 90,000 person years of observation time and over 2000 fractures. Relative risk of fracture for a decrease in bone mineral density of one standard deviation below age adjusted mean. All measuring sites had similar predictive abilities (relative risk 1.5 (95% confidence interval 1.4 to 1.6)) for decrease in bone mineral density except for measurement at spine for predicting vertebral fractures (relative risk 2.3 (1.9 to 2.8)) and measurement at hip for hip fractures (2.6 (2.0 to 3.5)). These results are in accordance with results of case-control studies. Predictive ability of decrease in bone mass was roughly similar to (or, for hip or spine measurements, better than) that of a 1 SD increase in blood pressure for stroke and better than a 1 SD increase in serum cholesterol concentration for cardiovascular disease. Measurements of bone mineral density can predict fracture risk but cannot identify individuals who will have a fracture. We do not recommend a programme of screening menopausal women for osteoporosis by measuring bone density.","A meta-analysis of 11 prospective cohort trials showed that all sites of bone mineral density measurements correlated with fractures (relative risk [RR], 1.5; 95% confi-dence interval [CI], 1.4-1.6.). However, dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry of the femoral neck predicted hip fracture better than other measures (RR, 2.6; 95% CI, 2.0-3.5)."
"What is the best way to evaluate secondary infertility
Varicoceles are associated with ipsilateral testicular atrophy in the adolescent. To determine if varicoceles are capable of causing progressive loss of fertility, we conducted a date-matched, retrospective study. We reviewed 2,989 patients evaluated for infertility at our institution from 1985 to 1990. A total of 285 (8.5%) patients were diagnosed with secondary infertility. A varicocele was identified as the cause of the patient's infertility in 177 (69%) men with secondary infertility. When matched by date to an identical number of men with primary infertility in whom 128 (50%) were infertile on the basis of a varicocele effect, the difference was significant (p < 0.0001). We conclude that a varicocele in some men is a progressive and not a static lesion resulting in the loss of previously established fertility. In addition, varicoceles are not only the leading cause of infertility in men with secondary infertility, but also occur with a greater frequency than in men with primary infertility.",A retrospective chart review compared 285 men with secondary infertility with 285 men with primary infertility. Varicoceles were the cause of secondary infertility in 177 (69%) of men with secondary infertility compared with 128 (50%) of men with primary infertility (P<.0001).
"What is the most effective treatment for acute low back pain
The purpose of the study was to assess the efficacy of epidural steroid injections for low-back pain. Data was obtained using computer-aided search of published randomized clinical trials and assessment of the methods of the studies. Twelve randomized clinical trials evaluating epidural steroid injections were identified. Data was extracted based on scores for quality of the methods, using 4 categories (study population, interventions, effect measurement, and data presentation and analysis) and the conclusion of the author(s) with regard to the efficacy of epidural steroid injections. Method scores of the trials ranged from 17 to 72 points (maximum 100 points). Eight trials showed method scores of 50 points or more. Of the 4 best studies (> 60 points), 2 reported positive outcomes and 2 reported negative results. Overall, 6 studies indicated that the epidural steroid injection was more effective than the reference treatment and 6 reported it to be no better or worse than the reference treatment. There appeared to be no relationship between the methodological quality of the trials and reported outcomes. In conclusion, there are flaws in the design of most studies. The best studies showed inconsistent results of epidural steroid injections. The efficacy of epidural steroid injections has not been established. The benefits of epidural steroid injections, if any, seem to be of short duration only. Future research efforts are warranted, but more attention should be paid to the methods of the trials.","A systematic review of 12 trials reported inconsistent results of facet joint, epidural, and local corticosteroid injections; however, only 1 studied epidural injections."
"Which healthy adults should take aspirin
Aspirin therapy reduces stroke by about 25% for persons with atherosclerotic vascular disease, but the effect in those without clinically apparent vascular disease is distinctly different. To define the effect of aspirin use on stroke and other major vascular events when given for primary prevention to persons without clinically recognized vascular disease. Systematic review of randomized clinical trials and large prospective observational cohort studies examining the relation between aspirin use and stroke in persons at low intrinsic risk. Studies were identified by a computerized search of the English-language literature. Five randomized trials of primary prevention included 52 251 participants randomized to aspirin doses ranging from 75 to 650 mg/d; the mean overall stroke rate was 0.3% per year during an average follow-up of 4.6 years. Meta-analysis revealed no significant effect on stroke (relative risk = 1.08; 95% confidence interval, 0.95-1.24) contrasting with a decrease in myocardial infarction (relative risk = 0.74; 95% confidence interval, 0.68-0.82). The lack of reduction of stroke by aspirin for primary prevention was incompatible with its protective effect against stroke in patients with manifest vascular disease (P = .001). Intracranial hemorrhage was increased by the regular use of aspirin (relative risk = 1.35; P = .03), similarly for both primary and secondary prevention. In 4 large observational studies, self-selected use of aspirin was consistently associated with higher rates of stroke. The effect of aspirin therapy on stroke differs between individuals based on the presence or absence of overt vascular disease, in contrast with the consistent reduction in myocardial infarction by aspirin therapy observed in all populations. We hypothesize that the effect of aspirin therapy on stroke for persons with major risk factors for vascular disease may be intermediate between a substantial decrease for those with manifest vascular disease and a possible small increase for healthy persons due to accentuated intracranial hemorrhage. When aspirin is given for primary prevention of vascular events, available data support using 75 to 81 mg/d.","Although the ideal aspirin dosage is uncertain, lower dosages (75-81 mg/d) have been shown to be as beneficial as higher dosages, and may have fewer bleeding complications. Buffered and entericcoated formulations are no more protective than plain aspirin."
"Are beta-2-agonists or anticholinergics more effective for treating COPD
Tiotropium, a once-daily anticholinergic, and salmeterol represent two inhaled, long-acting bronchodilators from different pharmacologic classes. A trial was designed to examine the efficacy and safety of both compounds with multiple outcome measures, including lung function, dyspnea, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in patients with COPD. A 6-month, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group study of tiotropium, 18 microg once daily via dry-powder inhaler, compared with salmeterol, 50 microg bid via metered-dose inhaler, was conducted in patients with COPD. Efficacy was assessed by 12-h monitoring of spirometry, transition dyspnea index (TDI), and the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ). A total of 623 patients participated (tiotropium, n= 209; salmeterol, n = 213; and placebo, n = 201). The groups were similar in age (mean, 65 years), gender (75% men), and baseline FEV(1) (mean, 1.08 +/- 0.37 L; percent predicted, 40 +/- 12% [+/- SD]). Compared with placebo treatment, the mean predose morning FEV(1) following 6 months of therapy increased significantly more for the tiotropium group (0.14 L) than the salmeterol group (0.09 L; p < 0.01). The average FEV(1) (0 to 12 h) for tiotropium was statistically superior to salmeterol (difference, 0.08 L; p < 0.001). Tiotropium improved TDI focal score by 1.02 U compared with placebo (p = 0.01), whereas there was no significant change in TDI focal score with salmeterol (0.24 U). Tiotropium was superior to salmeterol in improving TDI focal score (p < 0.05). At 6 months, the mean improvement in SGRQ total score vs baseline was tiotropium, - 5.14 U (p < 0.05 vs placebo); salmeterol, - 3.54 U (p = 0.4 vs placebo); and placebo, - 2.43 U. A statistically higher proportion of patients receiving tiotropium achieved at least a 4-U change in SGRQ score compared to patients receiving placebo. Both active drugs reduced the need for rescue albuterol (p < 0.0001). Tiotropium once daily produces superior bronchodilation, improvements in dyspnea, and proportion of patients achieving meaningful changes in HRQoL compared to twice-daily salmeterol in patients with COPD.","A 6-month, randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study evaluating the efficacy of salmeterol 50 µg twice daily vs tiotropium (a new long-acting inhaled anticholinergic) 18 µg once daily was published in 2002. Endpoints in 623 patients were assessed using 12-hour spirometric performance, transition dyspnea index (TDI), and the St. George Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ). (SGRQ is a validated disease-specific instrument designed to measure impact on overall health, daily life, and perceived well-being. It measures activity limitations, symptoms, and psychosocial impact.) Tiotropium showed superiority over salmeterol in all endpoints assessed (0.14 L increase in morning FEV1vs 0.09 L, 1.02 U improvement in TDI score vs 0.24, and -5.14 U improvement of SGRQ total score from baseline vs -3.54). However, it should be noted that a difference of 1 on the TDI score was necessary to suggest a clinical benefit. While the overall difference in SGQR between tiotropium and salmeterol did not reach statistical significance, the proportion of patients in the tiotropium group that reached the clinically significant threshold of 4 units improvement in SGRQ score was significantly higher than in the salmeterol group (51% vs 40%; P<.05)."
"Which treatments work best for hemorrhoids
The procedure for prolapse and hemorrhoids (stapled hemorrhoidopexy) has been introduced as an alternative to conventional hemorrhoidectomy. This is a systematic review on stapled hemorrhoidopexy of all randomized, controlled trials that have been published until August 2006. All published, randomized, controlled trials comparing stapled hemorrhoidopexy to conventional hemorrhoidectomy were identified from Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and all Evidence-Based Medicine Reviews (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trial, Cochrane Database of Systemic Review, and Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects) between January 1991 and August 2006. Meta-analysis was performed by using the Forest plot review if feasible. A total of 25 randomized, controlled trials with 1,918 procedures were reviewed. The follow-up duration was from 1 to 62 months. Stapled hemorrhoidopexy was associated with less operating time (weighted mean difference, -11.35 minutes; P = 0.006), earlier return of bowel function (weighted mean difference -9.91 hours; P < 0.00001), and shorter hospital stay (weighted mean difference, -1.07 days; P = 0.0004). There was less pain after stapled hemorrhoidopexy, as evidenced by lower pain scores at rest and on defecation and 37.6 percent reduction in analgesic requirement. The stapled hemorrhoidopexy allowed a faster functional recovery with shorter time off work (weighted mean difference, -8.45 days; P < 0.00001), earlier return to normal activities (weighted mean difference, -15.85 days; P = 0.03), and better wound healing (odds ratio, 0.1; P = 0.0006). The patients' satisfaction was significantly higher with stapled hemorrhoidopexy than conventional hemorrhoidectomy (odds ratio, 2.33; P = 0.003). Although there was increase in the recurrence of hemorrhoids at one year or more after stapled procedure (5.7 vs. 1 percent; odds ratio, 3.48; P = 0.02), the overall incidence of recurrent hemorrhoidal symptoms--early (fewer than 6 months; stapled vs. conventional: 24.8 vs. 31.7 percent; P = 0.08) or late (1 year or more) recurrence rate (stapled vs. conventional: 25.3 vs. 18.7 percent; P = 0.07)--was similar. The overall complication rate did not differ significantly from that of conventional procedure (stapled vs. conventional: 20.2 vs. 25.2 percent; P = 0.06). Compared with conventional surgery, stapled hemorrhoidopexy has less postoperative bleeding (odds ratio, 0.52; P = 0.001), wound complication (odds ratio, 0.05; P = 0.005), constipation (odds ratio, 0.45; P = 0.02), and pruritus (odds ratio, 0.19; P = 0.02). The overall need of surgical (odds ratio, 1.27; P = 0.4) and nonsurgical (odds ratio, 1.07; P = 0.82) reintervention after the two procedures was similar. The Procedure for Prolapse and Hemorrhoid (stapled hemorrhoidopexy) is safe with many short-term benefits. The long-term results are similar to conventional procedure.","A systematic review of 25 studies, including some that were of lower quality, showed a higher recurrence rate at 1 year with stapled hemorrhoidectomy than with conventional surgery."
"What measures relieve postherpetic neuralgia
The main risk factor for postherpetic neuralgia is increasing age; it is uncommon in people under 50 years, but develops in 20% of people aged 60-65 years who have had acute herpes zoster, and in more than 30% of those people aged over 80 years. Up to 2% of people with acute herpes zoster may continue to have postherpetic pain for 5 years or more. METHODS AND OUTCOMES: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of interventions, during an acute attack of herpes zoster, aimed at preventing postherpetic neuralgia? What are the effects of interventions to relieve established postherpetic neuralgia after the rash has healed? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to December 2006 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). We found 28 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions. In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: corticosteroids, dextromethorphan, dressings, gabapentin, oral antiviral agents, oral opioid analgesics, topical anaesthesia (lidocaine), topical antiviral agents (idoxuridine), topical counterirritants (capsaicin), tricyclic antidepressants.","A systematic review found gabapentin to be effective, with a range of number needed to treat from 2.8 to 5.3 for as much as 50% pain reduction based on the visual analog score (VAS)."
"How effective are dietary interventions in lowering lipids in adults with dyslipidemia
The effects of dietary soluble fibers on blood cholesterol are uncertain. This meta-analysis of 67 controlled trials was performed to quantify the cholesterol-lowering effect of major dietary fibers. Least-squares regression analyses were used to test the effect on blood lipids of pectin, oat bran, guar gum, and psyllium. Independent variables were type and amount of soluble fiber, initial cholesterol concentration, and other important study characteristics. Soluble fiber, 2-10 g/d, was associated with small but significant decreases in total cholesterol [-0.045 mmol L(-1).g soluble fiber(-1) (95% CI: -0.054, -0.035)] and LDL cholesterol [-0.057 mmol.L(-1).g(-1) (95% CI: -0.070, -0.044)]. The effects on plasma lipids of soluble fiber from oat, psyllium, or pectin were not significantly different. We were unable to compare effects of guar because of the limited number of studies using 2-10 g/d. Triacylglycerols and HDL cholesterol were not significantly influenced by soluble fiber. Lipid changes were independent of study design, treatment length, and background dietary fat content. Various soluble fibers reduce total and LDL cholesterol by similar amounts. The effect is small within the practical range of intake. For example, 3 g soluble fiber from oats (3 servings of oatmeal, 28 g each) can decrease total and LDL cholesterol by approximately 0.13 mmol/L. Increasing soluble fiber can make only a small contribution to dietary therapy to lower cholesterol.","A meta-analysis of 67 good-quality RCTs evaluated the effects of soluble dietary fiber in 2990 subjects (mean baseline lipid values [mg/dL]: total cholesterol, 240.9; LDL, 164.4). Diets high in soluble fiber (average dose of 9.5 g/d) were associated with a statistically significant decrease in total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein and no significant change in high density lipoprotein or triglycerides. Type of fiber (oat, psyllium, or pectin) was not influential after controlling for initial lipid level."
"What causes a low thyroid-stimulating hormone level with a normal free T4 level
NHANES III measured serum TSH, total serum T(4), antithyroperoxidase (TPOAb), and antithyroglobulin (TgAb) antibodies from a sample of 17,353 people aged > or =12 yr representing the geographic and ethnic distribution of the U.S. population. These data provide a reference for other studies of these analytes in the U.S. For the 16,533 people who did not report thyroid disease, goiter, or taking thyroid medications (disease-free population), we determined mean concentrations of TSH, T(4), TgAb, and TPOAb. A reference population of 13,344 people was selected from the disease-free population by excluding, in addition, those who were pregnant, taking androgens or estrogens, who had thyroid antibodies, or biochemical hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. The influence of demographics on TSH, T(4), and antibodies was examined. Hypothyroidism was found in 4.6% of the U.S. population (0.3% clinical and 4.3% subclinical) and hyperthyroidism in 1.3% (0.5% clinical and 0.7% subclinical). (Subclinical hypothyroidism is used in this paper to mean mild hypothyroidism, the term now preferred by the American Thyroid Association for the laboratory findings described.) For the disease-free population, mean serum TSH was 1.50 (95% confidence interval, 1.46-1.54) mIU/liter, was higher in females than males, and higher in white non-Hispanics (whites) [1.57 (1.52-1.62) mIU/liter] than black non-Hispanics (blacks) [1.18 (1.14-1.21) mIU/liter] (P < 0.001) or Mexican Americans [1.43 (1.40-1.46) mIU/liter] (P < 0.001). TgAb were positive in 10.4 +/- 0.5% and TPOAb, in 11.3 +/- 0.4%; positive antibodies were more prevalent in women than men, increased with age, and TPOAb were less prevalent in blacks (4.5 +/- 0.3%) than in whites (12.3 +/- 0.5%) (P < 0.001). TPOAb were significantly associated with hypo or hyperthyroidism, but TgAb were not. Using the reference population, geometric mean TSH was 1.40 +/- 0.02 mIU/liter and increased with age, and was significantly lower in blacks (1.18 +/- 0.02 mIU/liter) than whites (1.45 +/- 0.02 mIU/liter) (P < 0.001) and Mexican Americans (1.37 +/- 0.02 mIU/liter) (P < 0.001). Arithmetic mean total T(4) was 112.3 +/- 0.7 nmol/liter in the disease-free population and was consistently higher among Mexican Americans in all populations. In the reference population, mean total T(4) in Mexican Americans was (116.3 +/- 0.7 nmol/liter), significantly higher than whites (110.0 +/- 0.8 nmol/liter) or blacks (109.4 +/- 0.8 nmol/liter) (P < 0.0001). The difference persisted in all age groups. In summary, TSH and the prevalence of antithyroid antibodies are greater in females, increase with age, and are greater in whites and Mexican Americans than in blacks. TgAb alone in the absence of TPOAb is not significantly associated with thyroid disease. The lower prevalence of thyroid antibodies and lower TSH concentrations in blacks need more research to relate these findings to clinical status. A large proportion of the U.S. population unknowingly have laboratory evidence of thyroid disease, which supports the usefulness of screening for early detection.","The prevalence of subclinical hypothyroidism depends on the level of thyroid-stimulating hormone used as a threshold. When the lower limit of thyroid-stimulating hormone is set at 0.4 mIU/L, the prevalence was 3.2%."
"What are the best treatments for herpes labialis
Acyclovir cream has been available for the treatment of herpes labialis in numerous countries outside the United States for over a decade. Evidence for its efficacy comes from a few small clinical trials conducted in the 1980s. To examine more comprehensively the efficacy and safety of this formulation, we conducted two independent, identical, parallel, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, large-scale multicenter clinical trials. Healthy adults with a history of frequent herpes labialis were recruited from the general population, screened for eligibility, randomized equally to 5% acyclovir cream or vehicle control, given study medication, and told to self-initiate treatment five times daily for 4 days beginning within 1 h of the onset of a recurrent episode. The number of patients who treated a lesion was 686 in study 1 and 699 in study 2. In study 1, the mean duration of episodes was 4.3 days for patients treated with acyclovir cream and 4.8 days for those treated with the vehicle control (hazards ratio [HR] = 1.23; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.06 to 1.44; P = 0.007). In study 2, the mean duration of episodes was 4.6 days for patients treated with acyclovir cream and 5.2 days for those treated with the vehicle control (HR = 1.24; 95% CI, 1.06 to 1.44; P = 0.006). Efficacy was apparent whether therapy was initiated ""early"" (prodrome or erythema lesion stage) or ""late"" (papule or vesicle stage). There was a statistically significant reduction in the duration of lesion pain in both studies. Acyclovir cream did not prevent the development of classical lesions (progression to vesicles, ulcers, and/or crusts). Adverse events were mild and infrequent.","Two RCTs of topical acyclovir 5% cream, 5 times a day for 4 days (n=689, 699) showed that topical acyclovir, compared with placebo, shortened the duration of an outbreak by 0.5 day (4.3 vs 4.8) and 0.6 day (4.6 vs 5.2), respectively."
"What are safe sleeping arrangements for infants
There is evidence that the risk of sudden infant death syndrome is lower among ethnic groups in which parents generally share a room with the infant for sleeping. We investigated whether the presence of other family members in the infant's sleeping room affects the risk of the sudden infant death syndrome. The case-control study covered a region with 78% of all births in New Zealand during 1987-90. Home interviews were completed with parents of 393 (81.0% of total) babies who died from the sudden infant death syndrome aged 28 days to 1 year and 1592 (88.4% of total) controls, selected from all hospital births in the study region. The relative risk of sudden infant death for sharing the room with one or more adults compared with not sharing was 0.19 (95% CI 0.08-0.45) for sharing at night during the last 2 weeks and 0.27 (0.17-0.41) for sharing in the last sleep, after control for other confounders. Sharing the room with one or more children did not affect the relative risk (1.25 [0.86-1.82] for sharing during last 2 weeks; 1.29 [0.85-1.94] for sharing in last sleep). There was a significant interaction (p = 0.033) between not sharing the room with an adult and prone sleep position in the last sleep. Compared with infants sharing the room with an adult and not prone, the multivariate relative risk was 16.99 (10.43-27.69) for infants not sharing with an adult and prone, 3.28 (2.06-5.23) for infants sharing the room and prone, and 2.60 (1.58-4.30) for infants not sharing the room and not prone. The interaction between adult room-sharing and prone sleep position suggests that both exposures may affect the risk of sudden infant death syndrome through a common mechanism. We recommend that infants sleep in the same bedroom as their parents at night to reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome.","One study found the risk was present in infants less than 20 weeks, but was inconclusive for those greater than 20 weeks."
"Which strategies work best to prevent obesity in adults
Women 25 to 45 years old are at risk for weight gain and future obesity. This trial was designed to evaluate the efficacy of two interventions relative to a control group in preventing weight gain among normal or overweight women and to identify demographic, behavioral, and psychosocial factors related to weight gain prevention. Healthy women (N = 284), ages 25 to 44, with BMI < 30 were randomized to one of three intervention conditions: a clinic-based group, a correspondence course, or an information-only control. Intervention was provided over 2 years, with a follow-up at Year 3. BMI and factors related to eating and weight were assessed yearly. Over the 3-year study period, 40% (n = 114) of the women remained at or below baseline body weight (+/-2 lbs), and 60% gained weight (>2 lbs). Intervention had no effect on weight over time. Independently of intervention, women who were older, not actively dieting to lose weight, and who reported less perceived hunger at baseline were more likely to be successful at weight maintenance. Weight maintenance also was associated with increasing dietary restraint (conscious thoughts and purposeful behaviors to control calorie intake) and decreasing dietary disinhibition (the tendency to lose control over eating) over time. This study raises concern about the feasibility and efficacy of weight gain prevention interventions because most women were interested in weight loss, rather than weight gain prevention, and the interventions had no effect on weight stability. Novel approaches to the prevention of weight gain are needed.","An randomized controlled trials randomized 284 healthy 25- to 44-year-old women with body mass index <30 kg/m2 to group meetings, lessons by mail, or a control group that received an information booklet. The study found no significant difference among the 3 groups in weight maintenance at a 3-year follow-up; 40% maintained weight, and 60% gained more than 2 pounds."
"Should you use antibiotics to treat acute otitis media in children
Otitis media is a common pediatric problem, for which antibiotics are frequently prescribed. To determine the effectiveness of a short course of antibiotics (less than seven days) in comparison to a longer course (seven days or greater) for the treatment of acute otitis media in children. The medical literature was searched for randomized controlled studies of the treatment of ear infections in children with antibiotics published from January 1966 to July 1997. Search last updated March 1998. Studies were included if they met the following criteria: subjects one month to 18 years of age, clinical diagnosis of ear infection, no previous antimicrobial therapy and randomization to treatment with less than seven days versus seven days or more of antibiotics. Data on treatment outcomes were extracted from individual studies, and combined in the form of a summary odds ratio. A summary odds ratio (OR) equivalent to one indicated that the treatment failure rate following less than seven days of antibiotic treatment was similar to the failure rate following seven days or more of antibiotic. The summary OR for treatment outcomes at eight to 19 days in 1,524 children treated with short-acting antibiotics for five days versus eight to 10 days was 1.52, 95% CI: 1.17-1.98, but by 20 to 30 days outcomes between treatment groups (n=2,115) were comparable (OR=1.22, 95% CI:0.98-1.54). The absolute difference in treatment failure (Random effects model RD=2.9%, 95%CI:-0.3% to 6.1%) at 20 to 30 days suggests that at minimum 17 children would need to be treated with the long course of short-acting antibiotics to avoid one treatment failure. Similarity in outcomes was observed for up to three months following therapy (OR=1.16,95% CI=0.9-1.5). Comparable outcomes were shown between treatment with ceftriaxone or azithromycin, and more than seven days of other antibiotics. This review suggests that five days of short-acting antibiotic is effective treatment for uncomplicated ear infections in children.","A 2000 Cochrane review found that 5 days of antibiotic therapy was as effective as a 10-day course of treatment in otherwise healthy children with uncomplicated AOM. A slight increase in signs, symptoms, relapse, or reinfection among children receiving 5 days of antibiotics was noted at 8 to 18 days after treatment (OR=1.52; 95% CI, 1.17-1.98), but the finding was no longer statistically significant at 30 days (OR=1.22; 95% CI, 0.98-1.54)."
"What is the best management for patients with evidence of asymptomatic ischemia on exercise stress testing
The Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial (MRFIT), a coronary heart disease (CAD) primary prevention trial, examined the effect on the CAD mortality rate of a special intervention (SI) program to reduce blood cholesterol level, diastolic blood pressure and cigarette smoking in 35- to 57-year-old men. Half of the 12,866 participants were randomly assigned to usual care (UC) in the community. During 6 to 8 years of follow-up, the CAD mortality rate was 7% lower in the SI than in the UC group, a nonsignificant difference. An a priori subgroup hypothesis proposed that men with a normal electrocardiographic response to a heart-rate-limited exercise test would experience particular benefit from intervention. An abnormal response, defined as an ST-depression integral measured by computer greater than a pre-determined voltage-time cutpoint, was observed in 12.5% of the men at baseline, and was associated with a 3-fold elevation in risk of CAD death within the UC group. In the subgroup with a normal exercise electrocardiographic response, there was no significant SI-UC difference in the CAD mortality rate (16.0 and 13.8 per 1,000, respectively, for SI and UC men). In contrast, there was a 57% lower rate among men in the SI group with an abnormal test result compared with men in the UC group (22.2 vs 51.8 per 1,000). The relative risks (SI/UC) in these 2 strata were significantly different (p = 0.002). These findings suggest that men with elevated risk factors who have an abnormal exercise test response may benefit substantially from risk factor reduction.","While risk factor reduction seems logical for all patients who have asymptomatic ischemia, actual evidence of benefit is limited. In the MRFIT study, high-risk men with asymptomatic ischemia were randomized to either usual care or a special intervention to reduce smoking, blood cholesterol, and diastolic blood pressure. The intervention group had lower cardiac mortality than men who received usual care (22 vs 53 per 1000, P<.002)."
"What is the best diagnostic approach to alopecia in women
Alopecias are traditionally categorized by the presence or absence of scarring and by a diffuse or localized pattern. A common clinical conundrum is that of a woman presenting with the chief complaint of diffuse, nonscarring hair loss. We review the 4 main diagnostic possibilities for this clinical scenario: (1) female pattern hair loss (androgenetic alopecia), (2) acute and chronic telogen effluvium, (3) diffuse alopecia areata, and (4) loose anagen syndrome. We also outline our approach to the individual patient, emphasizing the pertinent history, physical examination, and appropriate diagnostic testing. This approach usually allows the clinician to make a definitive diagnosis or limited differential diagnosis and to offer the patient therapeutic options.","Ancillary laboratory evaluation is sometimes necessary if the diagnosis remains unclear.1,2 Serum ferritin or a complete blood count can be useful to look for iron-deficiency anemia; a thyroid-stimulating hormone test can rule out hypothyroidism."
"How should we manage infants at risk for group B streptococcal disease
Group B streptococcus (GBS) remains a leading cause of serious neonatal infection despite great progress in perinatal GBS disease prevention in the 1990s. In 1996, CDC, in collaboration with other agencies, published guidelines for the prevention of perinatal group B streptococcal disease (CDC. Prevention of perinatal group B streptococcal disease: a public health perspective. MMWR 1996;45[RR-7]:1-24). Data collected after the issuance of the 1996 guidelines prompted reevaluation of prevention strategies at a meeting of clinical and public health representatives in November 2001. This report replaces CDC's 1996 guidelines. The recommendations are based on available evidence and expert opinion where sufficient evidence was lacking. Although many of the recommendations in the 2002 guidelines are the same as those in 1996, they include some key changes: * Recommendation of universal prenatal screening for vaginal and rectal GBS colonization of all pregnant women at 35-37 weeks' gestation, based on recent documentation in a large retrospective cohort study of a strong protective effect of this culture-based screening strategy relative to the risk-based strategy * Updated prophylaxis regimens for women with penicillin allergy * Detailed instruction on prenatal specimen collection and expanded methods of GBS culture processing, including instructions on antimicrobial susceptibility testing * Recommendation against routine intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis for GBS-colonized women undergoing planned cesarean deliveries who have not begun labor or had rupture of membranes * A suggested algorithm for management of patients with threatened preterm delivery * An updated algorithm for management of newborns exposed to intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis Although universal screening for GBS colonization is anticipated to result in further reductions in the burden of GBS disease, the need to monitor for potential adverse consequences of intrapartum antibiotic use, such as emergence of bacterial antimicrobial resistance or increased incidence or severity of non-GBS neonatal pathogens, continues, and intrapartum antibiotics are still viewed as an interim strategy until GBS vaccines achieve licensure.",Intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis has decreased the incidence of early-onset group B streptococcal disease by 65% in the last decade.
"What is the best approach to prevention and treatment of osteoporosis
To determine if estrogen plus progestin reduces the incidence of fractures or height loss in postmenopausal women with coronary disease. We enrolled 2,763 postmenopausal women with coronary disease and with an intact uterus into the Heart Estrogen/progestin Replacement Study, a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled secondary prevention trial of cardiovascular disease. Radiographically documented clinical fractures were a prespecified secondary endpoint. Height loss was used as a surrogate for vertebral fractures. The average age of the women was 66.7 +/- 6.7 years, and fewer than 15% of the women had osteoporosis based on their bone density. Women were randomly assigned to either 0.625 mg of conjugated equine estrogens plus 2.5 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate in 1 tablet daily (n = 1,380) or placebo (n = 1,383). Follow-up averaged 4.1 years; 82% of those assigned to hormone treatment were taking it at the end of 1 year, and 64% at the end of the study. During 10,554 person years of follow-up, 286 women experienced a fracture: 138 in the treatment group (26.3 per 1,000 person years) and 148 in the placebo group (28.0 per 1,000 person years); relative hazard, 0.94; 95% confidence interval 0.8 to 1.2, P = 0.61). These included 58 wrist fractures (1.01; 0.6 to 1.7); 27 hip fractures (1.09; 0.5 to 2.3); 32 spine fractures (0.69; 0.3 to 1.4), and 192 other fractures (0.91; 0.7 to 1.2). There was no difference in average height loss between the treatment and placebo groups or in the percent of women who lost more than 2 cm in height: 10.6% in the treatment group and 12.1% in the placebo group. There was no evidence of a reduction in the incidence of fractures or rate of height loss in older women not selected for osteoporosis. Randomized studies are needed to clarify the effect of hormone replacement therapy on fracture risk among women with and without osteoporosis.","hormone replacement therapy has been associated with increased bone mineral density in RCTs, fewer fractures in observational studies, and fewer fractures in a recent meta-analysis of RCTs. hormone replacement therapy had the greatest benefit among women younger than 60 years (RR = 0.67; 95% CI, 0.56-0.94).4 For women older than 60 years, a nonsignificant trend toward benefit was found (RR = 0.88, 95% CI, 0.71-1.08). However, in a large randomized controlled trials of postmenopausal women, 85% without osteoporotic BMD, 4 years of hormone replacement therapy did not reduce fracture incidence."
"What is the recommended evaluation and treatment for elevated serum prolactin
Hyperprolactinemia is the most common endocrine disorder of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. While it can occur in men, it occurs more commonly in women. The prevalence of hyperprolactinemia ranges from 0.4% in an unselected normal adult population to as high as 9-17% in women with reproductive disorders. There are many possible causes of hyperprolactinemia, falling into three general categories: physiologic, pharmacologic and pathologic. When specific treatable underlying causes have been eliminated and in cases of severe hyperprolactinemia, the most likely cause is a prolactin (PRL)-secreting pituitary adenoma. Microadenomas should be treated medically, with a dopamine agonist, if there is an indication for therapy (such as amenorrhea, infertility or bothersome galactorrhea). If there is no indication for therapy, microadenomas may be followed conservatively, as growth is uncommon. Macroadenomas may grow larger; medical therapy is recommended initially, with neurosurgical evaluation reserved for specific clinical situations, such as failure of medical therapy and evidence of mass effect despite medical therapy. In the United States, the dopamine agonists indicated for treatment of hyperprolactinemia are bromocriptine and cabergoline. Bromocriptine is usually given once or twice daily, while cabergoline has a long duration of action and is given once or twice weekly. Results of comparative studies indicate that cabergoline is clearly superior to bromocriptine in efficacy (PRL suppression, restoration of gonadal function) and tolerability.","Medical therapy with a dopamine agonist is indicated for patients with either symptoms of hypogonadism due to elevated SPL, or neurologic symptoms due to the size of a macroadenoma."
"Does furosemide decrease morbidity or mortality for patients with diastolic or systolic dysfunction
We sought to determine whether non-potassium-sparing diuretics (PSDs) in the absence of a PSD may result in progressive heart failure (HF). Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors incompletely suppress ACE activity in HF patients. Furthermore, non-PSDs are activators of aldosterone secretion. We reasoned that non-PSDs, in the absence of a PSD, might result in progressive HF. In the 6,797 patients in the Studies Of Left Ventricular Dysfunction (SOLVD), we compared the risk of hospitalization for, or death from, HF between those taking a PSD and those who were not, adjusting for known covariates. The risk of hospitalization from worsening HF in those taking a PSD relative to those taking only a non-PSD was 0.74 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.55 to 0.99; p = 0.047). The relative risk for cardiovascular death was 0.74 (95% CI 0.59 to 0.93; p = 0.011), for death from all causes 0.73 (95% CI 0.59 to 0.90; p = 0.004), and for hospitalization for, or death from, HF 0.75 (95% CI 0.58 to 0.97; p = 0.030). Compared with patients not taking any diuretic, the risk of hospitalization or death due to worsening HF in patients taking non-PSDs alone was significantly increased (risk ratio [RR] = 1.31, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.57; p = 0.0004); this was not observed in patients taking PSDs with or without a non-PSD (RR = 0.99, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.30; p = 0.95). The use of PSDs in HF patients is associated with a reduced risk of death from, or hospitalization for, progressive HF or all-cause or cardiovascular death, compared with patients taking only a non-PSD.","One large retrospective study evaluated 6796 patients using potassium-sparing diuretics vs non-potassium-sparing diuretics in the Studies of Left Ventricular Dysfunction (SOLVD) trial. Rates of hospitalization or death from worsening congestive heart failure were significantly higher in the non-potassium-sparing diuretic population than in the nondiuretic population (relative risk [RR]=1.31, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.09-1.57; number needed to harm=5.78). This increased risk was not found for patients taking potassium-sparing diuretics (RR=0.99; 95% CI, 0.76-1.30)."
"When is it OK for children to start drinking fruit juice
To assess adherence to infant feeding recommendations among a sample of infants and toddlers four to 24 months of age in the United States. Descriptive analysis of data collected in the 2002 Feeding Infants and Toddlers Study (FITS) based on telephone interviews and 24-hour dietary recalls collected with the Nutrition Data System for Research of the University of Minnesota. A national random sample of 3,022 infants and toddlers age four to 24 months, including 2,024 infants age four to 11 months. Breastfeeding, timing of introduction of complementary foods, and adherence to infant feeding recommendations. Means and standard errors, percentile distributions, and percentages by age group (four to six months, seven to eight months, and nine to 11 months). About 76% of infants and toddlers were fully or partly breastfed at birth. This percentage declined to 30% at six months and 16% at 12 months-short of Healthy People 2010 goals of 50% and 25%, respectively. The average duration of breastfeeding was 5.5 months for all who initiated breastfeeding. About two-thirds of infants had been introduced to complementary foods between four and six months-the period recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP); 17% consumed juice before the AAP recommended age of six months or later. Twenty-two percent of infants nine to 11 months consumed cow's milk on a daily basis before the recommended age of 12 months or later, and one in 10 consumed french fries and/or sweetened beverages on any given day. More parents and caregivers can benefit from guidance about the introduction of developmentally appropriate, micronutrient-rich first solid foods such as iron-rich infant cereals, iron-fortified grain products, meats, soft fruits, and cooked vegetables and the importance of breastfeeding through the first year of life. A smaller proportion of parents and caregivers require guidance on delaying the introduction of juices until six months of age and cow's milk other than formula until one year of age.","Data from the Feeding Infants and Toddlers Survey (FITS) indicate that 100% fruit juice and sugar-sweetened beverages are now the second and third leading sources, respectively, of energy (and carbohydrates) for American children between 1 and 2 years of age."
"Which drugs are most effective for moderate to severe depression in adolescents
The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued warnings that use of antidepressant medications poses a small but significantly increased risk of suicidal ideation/suicide attempt for children and adolescents. To assess the efficacy and risk of reported suicidal ideation/suicide attempt of antidepressants for treatment of pediatric major depressive disorder (MDD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and non-OCD anxiety disorders. PubMed (1988 to July 2006), relevant US and British regulatory agency reports, published abstracts of important scientific meetings (1998-2006), clinical trial registries, and information from authors. Studies were published and unpublished randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trials of second-generation antidepressants (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, nefazodone, venlafaxine, and mirtazapine) in participants younger than 19 years with MDD, OCD, or non-OCD anxiety disorders. Information was extracted on study characteristics, efficacy outcomes, and spontaneously reported suicidal ideation/suicide attempt. Twenty-seven trials of pediatric MDD (n = 15), OCD (n = 6), and non-OCD anxiety disorders (n = 6) were selected, and risk differences for response and for suicidal ideation/suicide attempt estimated by random-effects methods. Pooled risk differences in rates of primary study-defined measures of responder status significantly favored antidepressants for MDD (11.0%; [95% confidence interval {CI}, 7.1% to 14.9%]), OCD (19.8% [95% CI, 13.0% to 26.6%), and non-OCD anxiety disorders (37.1% [22.5% to 51.7%]), corresponding to a number needed to treat (NNT) of 10 (95% CI, 7 to 15), 6 (4 to 8), and 3 (2 to 5), respectively. While there was increased risk difference of suicidal ideation/suicide attempt across all trials and indications for drug vs placebo (0.7%; 95% CI, 0.1% to 1.3%) (number needed to harm, 143 [95% CI, 77 to 1000]), the pooled risk differences within each indication were not statistically significant: 0.9% (95% CI, -0.1% to 1.9%) for MDD, 0.5% (-1.2% to 2.2%) for OCD, and 0.7% (-0.4% to 1.8%) for non-OCD anxiety disorders. There were no completed suicides. Age-stratified analyses showed that for children younger than 12 years with MDD, only fluoxetine showed benefit over placebo. In MDD trials, efficacy was moderated by age, duration of depression, and number of sites in the treatment trial. Relative to placebo, antidepressants are efficacious for pediatric MDD, OCD, and non-OCD anxiety disorders, although the effects are strongest in non-OCD anxiety disorders, intermediate in OCD, and more modest in MDD. Benefits of antidepressants appear to be much greater than risks from suicidal ideation/suicide attempt across indications, although comparison of benefit to risk varies as a function of indication, age, chronicity, and study conditions.",Pooled results of 3 RCTs demonstrated that paroxetine was no better than placebo. Two RCTs of citalopram and 1 randomized controlled trials of escitalopram showed marginally significant benefit over placebo only when pooled.
"Do any folk remedies or herbals help induce labor
This is one of a series of reviews of methods of cervical ripening and labour induction using standardised methodology. The use of complementary therapies is increasing and some women look to complementary therapies during pregnancy and childbirth to be used alongside conventional medical practice. Acupuncture involves the insertion of very fine needles into specific points of the body. The limited observational studies to date suggest acupuncture for induction of labour appears safe, has no known teratogenic effects, and may be effective. The evidence regarding the clinical effectiveness of this technique is limited. To determine the effects of acupuncture for third trimester cervical ripening or induction of labour. The Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group trials register (February 2003), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library, Issue 1, 2003), PubMed (1966 to present), CISCOM (1960 to present), EMBASE (1980 to present) and bibliographies of relevant papers. Clinical trials comparing acupuncture used for third trimester cervical ripening or labour induction with placebo/no treatment or other methods listed above it on a predefined list of labour induction methods. A strategy was developed to deal with the large volume and complexity of trial data relating to labour induction. This involved a two-stage method of data extraction. One trial of 56 women was included in the review. Data were not in a form that could be included in the meta-analysis. There is a need for well-designed randomised controlled trials to evaluate the role of acupuncture to induce labour and for trials to assess clinically meaningful outcomes.","A Cochrane systematic review evaluating acupuncture for inducing labor identified 1 randomized trial with methodologic flaws (allowing no conclusion), 3 case series, and 2 nonrandomized trials. The first case series used electroacupuncture at 38 to 42 weeks to successfully induce labor in 21 of 31 women. The second series, using acupuncture with and without electrical stimulation, induced labor in 10 of 12 women at 19 to 43 weeks. The third study induced labor with electroacupuncture in 78% of 41 women-34 term and postterm patients and 7 with a fetal demise. In the first nonrandomized trial, 20 of 27 women at term who received electroacupuncture gave birth between 39 weeks 3 days and 40 weeks, compared with 47 of 102 women in the control group. In the second study, 31 of 35 women who received electroacupuncture reported increased intensity of contractions compared with none of the 35 women in the control group."
"What are effective treatments for oppositional defiant behaviors in adolescents
The study tested alternative intervention strategies to reduce escalation in problem behaviors among high-risk young adolescents (11 to 14 years old). A total of 158 families with young adolescents (male and female) participated in this study. Of these, 119 families were randomly assigned to 1 of the following intervention conditions: (a) parent focus, (b) teen focus, (c) parent and teen focus, (d) self-directed change (materials only). In addition, 39 families of young adolescents were recruited as a quasi-experimental control. Parent focus and teen focus interventions resulted in immediate beneficial effects in observed and reported family conflict. The parent intervention conditions showed immediate beneficial effects on behavior problems at school. Longitudinal trends suggest that the parent focus condition may reduce subsequent tobacco use, compared with all other approaches. Interventions that aggregated high-risk youths into groups, however, showed the highest escalations in tobacco use and problem behavior at school, beginning at termination and persisting to follow-up. These findings are discussed with respect to the need to re-evaluate strategies that aggregate high-risk youths into intervention programs and focus more on strategies to engage parents in prevention.","A 2-year case-control study of 158 self-referred families with young adolescents (11 to 14 years old) without a formal oppositional defiant disorder diagnosis but with reported problem behaviors (defined as smoking, negative engagement in family problem solving, and parental ratings of unpleasant events) found significant improvements (P<.01) with parent-only, teen-only, and parent-teen behavioral interventions for negative engagement behaviors (average of 30% reduction in scores), and with parent and teen interventions for unpleasant events (average of 9% reduction in scores). Interventions comprised 12 weekly 90-minute sessions, with the parent-only group targeting family management practices and communication skills, the teen-only group targeting adolescent self-regulation and pro-social behavior, and the parent-teen group following a structured curriculum."
"How useful is high-sensitivity c-reactive protein as a risk factor for coronary artery disease
C-reactive protein is an inflammatory marker believed to be of value in the prediction of coronary events. We report data from a large study of C-reactive protein and other circulating inflammatory markers, as well as updated meta-analyses, to evaluate their relevance to the prediction of coronary heart disease. Measurements were made in samples obtained at base line from up to 2459 patients who had a nonfatal myocardial infarction or died of coronary heart disease during the study and from up to 3969 controls without a coronary heart disease event in the Reykjavik prospective study of 18,569 participants. Measurements were made in paired samples obtained an average of 12 years apart from 379 of these participants in order to quantify within-person fluctuations in inflammatory marker levels. The long-term stability of C-reactive protein values (within-person correlation coefficient, 0.59; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.52 to 0.66) was similar to that of both blood pressure and total serum cholesterol. After adjustment for base-line values for established risk factors, the odds ratio for coronary heart disease was 1.45 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.25 to 1.68) in a comparison of participants in the top third of the group with respect to base-line C-reactive protein values with those in the bottom third, and similar overall findings were observed in an updated meta-analysis involving a total of 7068 patients with coronary heart disease. By comparison, the odds ratios in the Reykjavik Study for coronary heart disease were somewhat weaker for the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (1.30; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.13 to 1.51) and the von Willebrand factor concentration (1.11; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.97 to 1.27) but generally stronger for established risk factors, such as an increased total cholesterol concentration (2.35; 95 percent confidence interval, 2.03 to 2.74) and cigarette smoking (1.87; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.62 to 2.16). C-reactive protein is a relatively moderate predictor of coronary heart disease. Recommendations regarding its use in predicting the likelihood of coronary heart disease may need to be reviewed.","A large study reports adjusted odds for development of coronary artery disease of 1.45 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.25-1.68) for subjects in the top third of hs-CRP levels compared with those in the bottom third. Odds ratios (OR) for other predictors of coronary artery disease are higher than this, in particular total cholesterol (OR=2.35; 95% CI, 2.03-2.74), cigarette smoking (OR=1.87; 95% CI, 1.62-2.22), and elevated systolic blood pressure (OR=1.50; 95% CI, 1.30-1.73). This shows that hs-CRP does not contribute as much as these factors to the established risk profile for coronary heart disease."
"Do patients at high risk of Alzheimer's disease benefit from early treatment
To assess the potential of anticholinergic drugs as a cause of non-degenerative mild cognitive impairment in elderly people. Longitudinal cohort study. 63 randomly selected general practices in the Montpellier region of southern France. 372 people aged > 60 years without dementia at recruitment. Anticholinergic burden from drug use, cognitive examination, and neurological assessment. 9.2% of subjects continuously used anticholinergic drugs during the year before cognitive assessment. Compared with non-users, they had poorer performance on reaction time, attention, delayed non-verbal memory, narrative recall, visuospatial construction, and language tasks but not on tasks of reasoning, immediate and delayed recall of wordlists, and implicit memory. Eighty per cent of the continuous users were classified as having mild cognitive impairment compared with 35% of non-users, and anticholinergic drug use was a strong predictor of mild cognitive impairment (odds ratio 5.12, P = 0.001). No difference was found between users and non-users in risk of developing dementia at follow-up after eight years. Elderly people taking anticholinergic drugs had significant deficits in cognitive functioning and were highly likely to be classified as mildly cognitively impaired, although not at increased risk for dementia. Doctors should assess current use of anticholinergic drugs in elderly people with mild cognitive impairment before considering administration of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors.","A longitudinal cohort study found that patients taking anticholinergic drugs had an 80% prevalence of MCI, compared with a 35% prevalence in a matched population of patients not using these drugs; yet Alzheimer's disease had not increased among the anticholinergic drug users at 8-year follow-up. Attributable risk for mild cognitive impairment from anticholinergic drug use was 19%. Stopping anticholinergic medications may reduce the prevalence of MCI."
"When should we screen children for hyperlipidemia
The recommended therapy of hypercholesterolemia in children consists of dietary modification and bile acid-binding resins. Unfortunately, the lipid-lowering efficacy of bile acid-binding resins is modest, and moreover, long-term compliance is poor because of side effects. In contrast, hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) are widely used in adults and are considered to be the first choice in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia in that age category. In the last few years, several randomized trials have been conducted to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of statin therapy in both children and adolescents. In this article, we review statin therapy in hypercholesterolemic children in terms of efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics, and psychosocial functioning. Statins are not only effective in reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in children with familial hypercholesterolemia but also improve endothelial function and reduce the progressive thickening of the intima media complex of the carotid arteries. Statins seem safe at the longer term in children in terms of plasma levels of liver enzymes and liver function, creatine kinase levels, and muscle function, as well as growth and sexual development. Long-term follow-up studies are needed to assess whether statin treatment started early in children with familial hypercholesterolemia can prevent future cardiovascular events.","The use of statins by children with familial hypercholesterolemia for up to 2 years is safe and lowers low density lipoprotein cholesterol. Longer use by children has not been studied, so no comment can be made about long-term safety and decreased coronary heart disease morbidity and mortality."
"How does venous thromboembolism risk for the patch and vaginal ring compare with oral contraceptives
This open-label, randomized, Phase III study compared the efficacy and tolerability of and compliance with NuvaRing, a combined contraceptive vaginal ring releasing 15 microg of ethinylestradiol (EE) and 120 microg of etonogestrel daily, with those of and with a combined oral contraceptive (COC) containing 150 microg of levonorgestrel (LNG) and 30 microg of EE. Subjects received NuvaRing or a COC for 13 cycles (3 weeks of ring/pill treatment followed by a 1-week ring-/pill-free period). A total of 1030 subjects (NuvaRing, n=512; COC, n=518) was randomized and started treatment (intent-to-treat [ITT] population). The percentage of women in the ITT population who completed the trial was 70.9% for the NuvaRing group and 71.2% for the COC group. Five in-treatment pregnancies occurred in each group, giving Pearl indices of 1.23 for NuvaRing and 1.19 for the COC. Compliance with both treatments was excellent and both were well tolerated. In conclusion, NuvaRing has comparable efficacy and tolerability with a COC containing 150 microg of LNG and 30 microg of EE and does not require daily dosing.","A 1-year, open-label, randomized Phase III study of 1030 women compared the NuvaRing with a combination oral contraceptive containing levonorgestrel and 30 µg EE. One case of deep venous thrombosis occurred in the NuvaRing group. In reviewing the data, the authors concluded that the NuvaRing demonstrated comparable safety and tolerability to the OC."
"Can patients with steatohepatitis take statins
Studies that evaluate the risk of hepatotoxicity from statins in hyperlipidemic subjects with elevated baseline serum transaminases are lacking. We conducted a study to test the hypothesis that patients with elevated baseline liver enzymes have higher risk of statin hepatotoxicity. Our study consisted of the following 3 cohorts of patients seen between January 1, 1998 and June 31, 2002: Cohort 1: 342 hyperlipidemic patients with elevated baseline enzymes (AST >40 IU/L or ALT >35 IU/L) who were prescribed a statin; cohort 2: 1437 hyperlipidemic patients with normal transaminases who were prescribed a statin; and cohort 3: 2245 patients with elevated liver enzymes but who were not prescribed a statin. The effect of statins on liver biochemistries was assessed over a 6-month period after statins were prescribed. Elevations in liver biochemistries during follow-up were categorized into mild-moderate or severe based on predefined criteria. The incidence of mild-moderate elevations and severe elevations in liver biochemistries in cohort 1 were 4.7% and 0.6%, respectively. Compared with cohort 1, individuals in cohort 2 had lower incidence of mild-moderate elevations (1.9%, P = 0.002) but not severe elevations (0.2%, P = 0.2). However, between cohorts 1 and 3, there were no differences in the incidence of mild-moderate elevations (4.7% vs. 6.4%, respectively, P = 0.2) or severe elevations (0.6% vs. 0.4%, respectively, P = 0.6). Statin discontinuation during the follow-up was similar between cohorts 1 and 2 (11.1% vs. 10.7%, respectively, P = 0.8). These data suggest that individuals with elevated baseline liver enzymes do not have higher risk for hepatotoxicity from statins.","A retrospective study of patients with baseline elevated transaminases who took statins showed no significant increase in transaminase levels during treatment compared with patients with elevated transaminases who did not take statins. The study reviewed electronic medical records for patients with preexisting elevated liver enzymes who initiated statin therapy (atorvastatin, simvastatin, or fluvastatin) and had follow-up labs drawn 6 months later (cohort 1, n=342). The comparison groups included patients with normal liver enzymes who initiated statins (cohort 2, n=1437) and patients with elevated baseline liver enzymes who did not take statins (cohort 3, n=2245). At follow-up, 4.7% of cohort 1 patients had mild-to-moderate elevations in liver enzymes, which did not differ significantly (P=.2) from those in cohort 3. Within cohort 2, 1.9% experienced mild-to-moderate elevations of transaminases (defined as less than 10 times the upper limit of normal)."
"Do antibiotics interfere with the efficacy of oral contraceptives
To evaluate the evidence on possible drug interactions between antibiotics and oral contraceptives (OCs) that may lead to OC failure. MEDLINE and Lexis/Nexis Medical Library searches for 1966-1999 using the key word ""oral contraceptives,"" cross-indexed with the terms ""antibiotics,"" ""adverse effects,"" and ""pregnancy,"" and MEDLINE search using the additional MeSH term ""drug interactions."" No language restrictions were used. A total of 167 articles were retrieved for analysis. Another 32 articles were identified by review of the references cited in these publications. Articles were selected based on their ability to provide information on the relationship between antibiotic therapy and OC efficacy in otherwise compliant users (defined as women with unplanned pregnancies who reported compliance with their OC regimen). Additionally, studies that either directly measured the effects of antibiotics on the pharmacokinetics of OC components, or that analyzed the effects of antibiotics on measures of ovulation in OC users were accepted. At least 30 cases have been reported of pregnancies occurring in women taking OCs and antibiotics, particularly rifampin. Approximately 20% of pregnant women reporting to family planning or abortion clinics reported concomitant OC and antibiotic use. Information from adverse event reporting databases generally mirrors the types of information gleaned from these case reports and clinical surveys and accounts for approximately one-third of reported cases. Retrospective surveys, primarily from dermatology-based practices, also have reported 24 pregnancies in OC users who concomitantly received therapy with antibiotics, most commonly tetracyclines and penicillins. Apparent OC failure rates in clinical surveys were within the usual range expected for patterns of typical use. In pooled results obtained from relatively small populations, oral antibiotics, with the exception of rifampin, have not significantly affected the pharmacokinetics of ethinyl estradiol, levonorgestrel, and norethindrone or reduced the serum concentrations of gonadotropins. However, individual patients have been identified who experienced significant decreases in the plasma concentration of these components of OCs and who appeared to ovulate. Rifampin impairs the effectiveness of OCs. Pharmacokinetic studies of other antibiotics have not shown any systematic interaction between antibiotics and OC steroids. However, individual patients do show large decreases in the plasma concentrations of ethinyl estradiol when they take certain other antibiotics, notably tetracycline and penicillin derivatives. Because it is not possible to identify these women in advance, a cautious approach is advised.","Multiple studies have looked at oral contraceptive serum levels with and without antibiotic treatment. These studies show that the coadministration of antibiotics (ampicillin, tetracycline, doxycycline, metronidazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin, temafloxacin, fluconazole, ciprofloxacin, or ofloxacin) did not reduce serum levels of either the estrogen or progestin components of the oral contraceptives."
"Which drugs are safest for moderate to severe depression in adolescents
There has been concern that widely used antidepressant agents might be associated with an increased risk of suicidal ideation and behavior (suicidality) in pediatric patients. To investigate the relationship between antidepressant drugs and suicidality in pediatric patients participating in randomized, placebo-controlled trials. Data were derived from 23 trials conducted in 9 drug company-supported programs evaluating the effectiveness of antidepressants in pediatric patients and 1 multicenter trial (the Treatment for Adolescents With Depression Study) that evaluated fluoxetine hydrochloride. All placebo-controlled trials submitted to the Food and Drug Administration were eligible for inclusion. Evaluable data were derived from 4582 patients in 24 trials. Sixteen trials studied patients with major depressive disorder, and the remaining 8 studied obsessive-compulsive disorder (n = 4), generalized anxiety disorder (n = 2), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (n = 1), and social anxiety disorder (n = 1). Only 20 trials were included in the risk ratio analysis of suicidality because 4 trials had no events in the drug or placebo groups. Individual patient data were available for all the trials. A meta-analysis was conducted to obtain overall suicidality risk estimates for each drug individually, for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in depression trials as a group, and for all evaluable trials combined. There were no completed suicides in any of these trials. The multicenter trial was the only individual trial to show a statistically significant risk ratio (4.62; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-20.92). The overall risk ratio for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in depression trials was 1.66 (95% CI, 1.02-2.68) and for all drugs across all indications was 1.95 (95% CI, 1.28-2.98). The overall risk difference for all drugs across all indications was 0.02 (95% CI, 0.01-0.03). Use of antidepressant drugs in pediatric patients is associated with a modestly increased risk of suicidality.","A recent study that incorporated the food and drug administration meta-analysis analyzed data from 4582 patients. Although no completed suicides were reported in any trial, the drug-treated groups had a two-fold in-crease in suicidality compared with placebo groups (4% vs 2%; number needed to harm [NNH]=50)."
"Do antibiotics prevent recurrent urinary tract infection in children with anatomic abnormalities
The objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of low-dose, long-term antibiotics for the prevention of symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI) in children. This was a systematic review of randomized controlled trials with a random effects model meta-analysis. Five trials involving 463 children were performed. Three trials (n = 392) evaluated the effectiveness of long treatment courses of antibiotics (2 to 6 months) for children with acute UTI to prevent subsequent, off-treatment infection. Only 2 trials (n = 71) evaluated the effectiveness of long-term, low-dose antibiotics to prevent on-treatment UTI. Very few of the children enrolled in the trials were boys, had abnormal renal tracts, or were infants. The trial quality was poor, with a lack of blinding, and unstated UTI definitions were almost universal. Long-term antibiotic administration reduced the risk of UTI with treatment (relative risk 0.31, 95% confidence limits 0.10 to 1.00), but there was significant heterogeneity (Q = 13.45, P <.01), and there was no sustained benefit once antibiotics had ceased (relative risk 0.79, 0.61 to 1.02). Methodologic and applicability problems with published trials mean that there is considerable uncertainty about whether long-term, low-dose antibiotic administration prevents UTI in children. Well-designed, randomized, placebo-controlled trials are still required to evaluate this commonly used intervention.",A systematic review evaluated the use of antibiotics to prevent urinary tract infection in children. This review of 5 randomized controlled trials included a total of 463 children between the ages of 2 months to 16 years. Three out of 5 trials evaluated the effectiveness of antibiotic treatment for 2 to 6 months to prevent subsequent off-treatment recurrence. The 2 smaller trials (n=71) evaluated the use of low-dose long-term antibiotics to prevent UTI. Benefits for long-term prophylaxis are even less clear in children with low-grade reflux (I-II).
"Can patients with steatohepatitis take statins
It is recommended that lovastatin be avoided in patients with unexplained elevation in transaminase levels. However, there are no studies that evaluated the risk of lovastatin hepatotoxicity in subjects with elevated liver enzymes. Our study tested the hypothesis that patients with elevated liver enzymes are not at higher risk for hepatotoxicity from lovastatin. Our study consisted of the following three cohorts of patients seen between December 1987 and December 1998: cohort 1: 135 patients with elevated baseline enzymes (aspartate transaminase [AST] >40 IU/L or alanine transaminase [ALT] >35 IU/L) who received lovastatin; cohort 2: 620 patients without elevated liver enzymes who received lovastatin; and cohort 3: 2644 patients with elevated liver enzymes but not prescribed lovastatin. Elevations in liver biochemistries over a 12-month period after lovastatin was prescribed were categorized into mild-moderate or severe elevations and into ""Hy's Rule"" based on published criteria. The incidence of mild-moderate elevations and severe elevations in liver biochemistries in cohort 1 were 6.6% and 0%, respectively. Compared with cohort 2, individuals in cohort 1 had higher incidence of mild-moderate elevations (6.6% versus 3%; P = 0.03) but not severe elevations (0% versus 0.3%; P = 0.9). Compared with cohort 3, patients in cohort 1 had similar mild-moderate elevations (6.6% versus 11%; P = 0.2) but lower severe elevations (0% versus 5.5%; P < 0.01). No one in cohorts 1 or 2 developed elevations meeting Hy's Rule, whereas 3.5% of the patients in cohort 3 exhibited such elevations (P < 0.05 versus cohort 1 or cohort 2). Significant hepatotoxicity from lovastatin was very infrequent in this study, and individuals with elevated baseline liver enzyme levels did not have higher frequency of lovastatin hepatotoxicity than those with normal liver enzyme levels.","A retrospective study of patients with baseline elevated transaminases who took statins showed no significant increase in transaminase levels during treatment compared with patients with elevated transaminases who did not take statins. The cohort study of patients with preexisting elevated liver enzymes found comparable results with lovastatin. Among lovastatin patients (n=135), 6.6% had mild-to-moderate elevations in transaminases during therapy vs 11% of the cohort of patients with preexisting elevated liver enzymes who did not take statins. This difference was not statistically significant (P=.2)."
"Is folate supplementation indicated for patients with coronary artery disease
To establish guidelines for the screening and treatment of hyperhomocysteinemia in the investigation and management of coronary artery disease (CAD). Measurement of plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) levels in the fasting state or 4-6 hours after oral methionine load; vitamin supplementation with folic acid and vitamins B6 and B12; adherence to the recommended daily allowance of dietary sources of folate and vitamins B6 and B12. This article reviews the available evidence on the association between plasma tHcy levels and CAD and the effect of lowering tHcy levels through vitamin supplementation or dietary intake. MEDLINE was searched for relevant English-language articles published from January 1966 to June 1999; also reviewed were additional articles identified from the bibliographies. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in Canada. Homocysteine, generated in the metabolism of methionine, may have a role in the development of cardiovascular disease. The prevalence of hyperhomocysteinemia in the general population is between 5% and 10% and may be as high as 30%-40% in the elderly population. If population-based studies are correct, tHcy may be responsible for up to 10% of CAD events and thus may represent an important and potentially modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Laboratory testing for tHcy is currently restricted to research centres, and costs range from $30 to $50 per person. Newer, less costly techniques have been developed and should become readily available with time. The strength of evidence was evaluated using the methods of the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care. Although there is insufficient evidence to recommend the screening or management of hyperhomocysteinemia at present (grade C recommendation), adherence to recommended daily allowance of dietary sources of folate and vitamins B12 and B6 should be encouraged. If elevated tHcy levels are discovered, vitamin deficiency should be ruled out to allow specific treatment and prevention of complications, such as neurological sequelae due to vitamin B12 deficiency. Experts in the field advocate treatment of elevated tHcy levels in high-risk people, such as those with a personal or family history of premature atherosclerosis or a predisposition to develop hyperhomocysteinemia. Definitive guidelines for the management of hyperhomocysteinemia await the completion of randomized trials to establish the effect of vitamin supplementation on CAD events. The findings of this analysis were reviewed through an iterative process by the members of the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care. The Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care is funded through a partnership between the Provincial and Territorial Ministries of Health and Health Canada.","In 22 of 27 retrospective case-control studies, patients with coronary artery disease had significantly higher plasma homocysteine levels than control subjects (odds ratio [OR]=1.2-10.9, after adjustment for other coronary artery disease risk factors). However, only 4 of 7 prospective nested case-control trials showed a correlation between elevated homocysteine and myocardial infarction (MI) and coronary death."
"What is the best approach to prevention and treatment of osteoporosis
With the aging of the population, the medical and social costs of skeletal fragility leading to fractures will cause an immense burden on society unless effective prophylactic and therapeutic regimens can be developed. Exercise is suggested as a possible regimen against involutional bone loss. The purpose of the present meta-analysis is to address a quantitative review of the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and nonrandomized controlled trials (CTs) on the effects of exercise training programs on bone mass, measured as bone mineral density (BMD) or bone mineral content (BMC), of the lumbar spine (LS) and the femoral neck (FN) in pre- and postmenopausal women. The literature from 1966 through December 1996 was searched for published RCTs and CTs. Study treatment effect is defined as the difference between percentage change in bone mass per year in the training group and the control group. Overall treatment effects (OTs) with the 95% confidence intervals of these study treatment effects were calculated using inverse-variance weighting. Of the 62 articles identified, 25 met the inclusion criteria and were maintained for further analyses. The weighted OTs for the RCTs showed very consistently that the exercise training programs prevented or reversed almost 1% of bone loss per year in both LS and FN for both pre- and postmenopausal women. The two OTs that could be calculated for strength training programs did not reach significance. The OTs for the CTs were almost twice as high as those for the RCTs, which gives an indication of the confounding introduced by the nonrandom allocation of the subjects to groups.","Raloxifene and calcitonin have some supporting evidence as well. In a large 4-year placebo-controlled trial, raloxifene decreased vertebral fracture risk (RR = 0.7; 95% CI, 0.5-0.8) but had no effect on hip fracture and a threefold increase in thromboembolic risk (RR = 3.1; 95% CI, 1.5-6.2).7 Regarding calcitonin, one randomized controlled trials compared 3 doses of intranasal calcitonin and placebo in osteoporotic women and showed an increase in lumbar spine bone mineral density in treated groups.8 Over the 5-year study (59% of participants were lost to follow-up), there was a 39% reduction in risk of radiologic deformities (P=.03) only for women taking 200 IU. Many subjects also used vitamin D and calcium, but effective doses of both agents are still in question. Combined calcium and vitamin D supplements have decreased fracture risk using 700 to 800 international units of vitamin D and 500 to 1200 mg of calcium daily,9 but a systematic review of vitamin D without calcium found no clear benefit.10 A meta-analysis showed that exercise training programs may play a preventive role, potentially preventing or reversing 1% of bone loss annually among women."
"What treatments prevent miscarriage after recurrent pregnancy loss
Progesterone, a female sex hormone, is known to induce secretory changes in the lining of the uterus essential for successful implantation of a fertilized egg. It has been suggested that a causative factor in many cases of miscarriage may be inadequate secretion of progestogens. Therefore, progestational agents have been used, beginning in the first trimester of pregnancy, in an attempt to prevent spontaneous miscarriage. To determine the efficacy and safety of progestogens as a preventative therapy against miscarriage. We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group trials register (April 2003), CENTRAL, MEDLINE (1966 to April 2003), EMBASE (1980 to April 2003), CINAHL (1982 to April 2003), NHMRC Clinical Trials Register (April 2003) and Meta-Register (April 2003). We searched references from relevant articles, attempting to contact authors where necessary, and contacted experts in the field for unpublished works. Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing progestogens with placebo or no treatment given in an effort to prevent miscarriage. Thirty trials were identified in the initial search. At least, two reviewers assessed trial quality and extracted data. Data for all outcomes were in dichotomous form and the Peto odds ratio was used in the meta-analysis for all comparisons. Fourteen trials (1988 women) met the inclusion criteria. The meta-analysis of all women, regardless of gravidity and number of previous miscarriages, showed no statistically significant difference in the risk of miscarriage between progestogen and placebo or no treatment groups (odds ratio (OR) 1.05, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.83 to 1.34) and no statistically significant difference in the incidence of adverse effect in either mother or baby. In a subgroup analysis of three trials involving women who had recurrent miscarriages (three or more consecutive miscarriages), progestogen treatment showed a statistically significant decrease in miscarriage rate compared to placebo or no treatment (OR 0.39, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.91). No statistically significant differences were found between the route of administration of progestogen (oral, intramuscular, vaginal) versus placebo or no treatment. There is no evidence to support the routine use of progestogen to prevent miscarriage in early to mid pregnancy. However, further trials in women with a history of recurrent miscarriage may be warranted, given the trend for improved live birth rates in these women and the finding of no statistically significant difference between treatment and control groups in rates of adverse effects suffered by either mother or baby in the available evidence.","A Cochrane meta-analysis on the use of progesterone to prevent pregnancy loss looked at a subset of 3 small RCTs that evaluated women with 3 or more pregnancy losses. Patients with primary recurrent spontaneous abortion (RSA) (no prior live births), were not differentiated from those with secondary recurrent spontaneous abortion (previous live birth with subsequent miscarriages). Progesterone administration resulted in a significant reduction in miscarriage compared with placebo (odds ratio [OR]=0.37; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.17-0.91), independent of administration routes (oral, vaginal, or intramuscular). This benefit was lost in the larger meta-analysis when studies containing women with fewer than 3 pregnancy losses were included."
"First- or second-generation antihistamines: which are more effective at controlling pruritus
This review begins with a brief survey of the neurophysiology and neuroanatomy of pruritus, and goes on to describe the etiology of the major allergic and nonallergic pruritic disorders. The etiology of pruritus often suggests the appropriate treatment. For example, urticaria, which is primarily mediated by histamine, is amenable to treatment with H1 antihistamines. Second-generation, nonsedating antihistamines appear to be more effective than sedating antihistamines, perhaps because of better compliance. Other systemic pharmacologic options may be useful in nonhistamine-mediated disorders, for example, immunomodulators for inflammation-induced pruritus or opiate antagonists for atopic dermatitis. Nonpharmacologic measures, such as proper skin care, and physical modalities, such as phototherapy or acupuncture, may also be helpful.","One recent nonsystematic, narrative review of pruritic dermatoses concluded second-generation antihistamines appear to be more effective."
"What is the best approach for patients with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance detected on Pap smear
Controversy exists in the United States regarding the proper evaluation and management of low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) and equivocal (atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance [ASCUS, now ASC-US]) cervical cytologic interpretations. To address this issue, the National Cancer Institute initiated the ASCUS-LSIL Triage Study (ALTS). ALTS is a multicenter, randomized clinical trial designed to evaluate 3 alternative methods of management, namely, immediate colposcopy, cytologic follow-up, and triage by human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing. This article summarizes the major findings of ALTS that have been published to date. Patients with ASCUS (n = 3488) or LSIL (n = 1572) were randomly assigned to research arms between November 1996 and December 1998, and were monitored for 2 years. The disease outcome was histologic cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 3/cancer. The prevalence of oncogenic HPV was too high to permit effective triage of LSIL using HPV DNA testing by Hybrid Capture 2. However, for the women referred with a cytologic interpretation of ASCUS, HPV triage proved useful, with sensitivity equivalent to immediate colposcopy and a halving of colposcopic referrals. Among older women with ASCUS, HPV testing remained sensitive for detecting CIN 3 and cancer, but the referral percentage was dramatically lower compared to younger women. ALTS yielded insight into the performance of cytology and histopathology; experienced pathologists differed significantly in their interpretations of cervical abnormalities, especially histologic CIN 1 and cytologic ASCUS. Nonetheless, it was possible to distinguish a relatively uncommon type of ASCUS, equivocal for high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion, that has a high positive predictive value for identifying women with underlying high-grade CIN. Many additional analyses are underway.","For women aged 29 years or older, HPV testing resulted in a much lower colposcopy referral rate, 31% vs 65% for younger women, without sacrificing sensitivity."
"Does a low-fat diet help prevent breast cancer
Pooled analyses of cohort studies show no relation between fat intake and breast-cancer risk. However, food-frequency questionnaire (FFQ) methods used in these studies are prone to measurement error. We assessed diet with an FFQ and a detailed 7-day food diary in 13070 women between 1993 and 1997. We compared 168 breast-cancer cases incident by 2000 with four matched controls. Risk of breast cancer was associated with saturated-fat intake measured with the food diary (hazard ratio 1.22 [95% CI 1.06-1.40], p=0.005, per quintile increase in energy-adjusted fat intake), but not with saturated fat measured with the FFQ (1.10 [0.94-1.29], p=0.23). Dietary measurement error might explain the absence of a significant association between dietary fat and breast-cancer risk in cohort studies.","Case-control studies have shown some minimally increased risk related to dietary fat consumption, but there is concern about recall bias in these studies."
"What is the best workup for hypocalcemia
The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency was evaluated in a population of elderly institutionalized subjects in seven long-term geriatric care facilities in France (Amiens, Francheville, Ivry, Lille, Montpellier, Oissel and Villejuif). Residents whose functional capability was relatively good were entered into the study. There were 126 patients (99 females and 27 males) with a mean age +/- SD of 84 +/- 6.6 years. All subjects had been institutionalized for over six months and were capable of walking at least as far as the dining room. None had received vitamin D or other compounds known to affect the metabolism of phosphorus and calcium within six months before the study. Vitamin D status was evaluated by determining serum 25 hydroxyvitamin D (25 OH D) levels using a radiocompetition assay after extraction and chromatographic separation. Mean serum 25 OH D was 3.17 +/- 2.52 ng/ml (median 2.5). Eighty-five per cent of subjects had serum 25 OH D values of less than 5 ng/ml and 98% had values under 10 ng/ml, which is the cutoff usually taken to define vitamin D deficiency. Mean serum levels of intact parathyroid hormone were increased approximately two-fold as compared with values in healthy adults (70 +/- 39 pg/ml versus 33 +/- 12 pg/ml). Biochemical markers for bone formation (alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin) and bone resorption (TRAP, hydroxyproline, pyridinoline) were all increased, with mean values 1.4-fold to 3.4-fold those seen in healthy adults. Serum 25 OH D levels were negatively correlated with serum intact parathyroid hormone levels (r = 0.41; p < 0.0001). Serum intact parathyroid hormone levels were positively correlated with alkaline phosphatase activity (r = 0.30; p < 0.001) and serum osteocalcin levels (r = 0.36; p < 0.0001) and negatively correlated with corrected serum calcium levels (r = -0.20; p < 0.02). Conclusion. Our data demonstrate that severe vitamin D deficiency is present in virtually all elderly institutionalized subjects and is accompanied with secondary hyperparathyroidism responsible for increases in markers of bone remodeling. Routine vitamin D supplementation is warranted in elderly institutionalized subjects.",The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (<15 ng/mL of 25-OH vitamin D) is and 95% in institutionalized elderly patients.
"What's the best way to screen for anxiety and panic disorders
The research literature is replete with evidence of and concerns about the prevalence and undertreatment of mental disorders in primary care. Although screening, on its own, may not directly affect clinical outcomes, it is still the most efficient and effective way to identify psychologically distressed patients for either research purposes or to provide patients with or refer patients to appropriate care. The current study sought to establish the utility of the MHI-5 for the detection of patients suffering from major depression or panic disorder, two of the most common psychiatric conditions seen in primary care settings. This study was conducted in a family medicine clinic and 246 adult outpatients participated. Patients completed the Mental Health Index-5 (MHI-5) as the screening measure and the PRIME-MD Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) as the diagnostic instrument. ROC analyses indicated that a cut-off score of 23 on the MHI-5 yielded a sensitivity of 91% and a specificity of 58% for predicting provisional diagnoses of major depression or panic disorder from the PHQ. Using a single item to screen for a PHQ diagnosis of major depression yielded a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 62% and a second question had a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 63% for PHQ diagnosis of panic disorder. These results indicate that it is possible to use a small number of items to efficiently and effectively screen for mental disorders affecting a significant portion of primary care patients.",The MHI-5 screens for panic disorder with a single item taken from a larger questionnaire for panic disorder and depression. It has 100% sensitivity but a poor positive likelihood ratio. The sample size was very small-only 9 persons with panic disorder were tested.
"What is the best way to distinguish type 1 and 2 diabetes
Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) has been reported to occur in type 2 diabetes, but the frequency and distinguishing features of this syndrome remain to be defined. We determined the ""diabetic types,"" ethnic distributions, and phenotypes of patients with DKA in an urban hospital. We reviewed the hospital admissions and followed the clinical course of adults who developed DKA. We classified patients as ""type 1,"" ""type 2,"" or ""new onset"" based on their treatment history. New-onset patients were reassessed 2 1/2 years or more after the episode of DKA and classified as ""type 1"" or ""type 2"" based on insulin requirements. We compared the groups for ethnic distributions and clinical features. Of 141 patients, 55 (39%) who presented with DKA had type 2 diabetes, while 75 (53%) had type 1 diabetes and 11 (8%) could not be ""typed."" Hispanics mainly had type 2 and whites predominantly had type 1, while African Americans had a slight preponderance of type 1 diabetes (P=.001). Type 1 patients were mainly lean, while the body mass indexes (BMIs) (calculated as the weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters) of type 2 patients were bimodally distributed (33% with BMI<25 and 51% with BMI>30; P<.001). Age of onset of diabetes was predominantly younger than 40 years in the type 1 group but was more broadly distributed in the type 2 group (P<.001). Ninety-three percent of the new-onset patients who were reassessed had type 2 diabetes. Half of the type 2 patients had no identifiable stress factor associated with the episode of DKA. A high proportion of DKA in nonwhite adults occurs in persons with type 2 diabetes, especially in those with previously undiagnosed diabetes. The frequency and clinical heterogeneity of this syndrome in a multiethnic population have significant implications for the diagnosis, classification, and management of adults with diabetes.","A history of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) also does not reliably distinguish between types 1 and 2. A retrospective chart review gathered data on adults over 18 years of age who were admitted for DKA in a urban US hospital. Many patients with DKA were subsequently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. Rates of type 2 diabetes in patients with DKA varied by race: 47% of Hispanics, 44% of African Americans, and 17% of Caucasians had type 2 diabetes."
"Do abnormal fetal kick counts predict intrauterine death in average-risk pregnancies
A complaint of decreased fetal movements is a common indication for the assessment of fetal well being. The aim of this study was to review the outcome of a group of women whose primary indication for referral was decreased fetal movements. Over a 20 month period, 435 patients were seen in the fetal assessment unit of an inner London teaching hospital, following a primary complaint of reduced fetal movements. Investigations included: the fetal abdominal circumference (AC), amniotic fluid volume (AFV), the umbilical artery pulsatility index (UAPI) derived from Doppler ultrasound waveforms and a computerised analysis of fetal heart rate (FHR) recordings or cardiotocograph (CTG). Outcome measures were: gestational age at delivery, Apgar score < 7 at 5 minutes, admission to the Special Care Baby Unit (SCBU), the need for delivery by an emergency cesarean section for fetal compromise (CSFC), and any perinatal deaths. A comparison of actual versus expected outcome for women with decreased fetal movement revealed the following relative risks, with the 95% confidence intervals (CI) in brackets; low 5 minute Apgar score 0.03 vs. 0.05 expected (CI = 0.01, 0.05), SCBU admission, 0.06 vs. 0.07 (0.04, 0.08), and preterm delivery, 0.08 vs. 0.11 (0.05, 0.10). Cesarean sections for fetal compromise, 0.07 vs. 0.053 (0.050-0.096). The addition of FHR monitoring to standard ultrasound assessment of well being did not appear to confer any added benefit. There were no fetal deaths. The outcome for pregnancies where the mother presents with decreased fetal movements in the third trimester is comparable with the outcome for the general population.","A retrospective cohort study of 6793 patients compared pregnancy outcomes of 463 women who presented for evaluation of decreased fetal movement with outcomes among the general obstetric population. The study excluded women who reported complete cessation of fetal movement. Pregnancies evaluated for decreased fetal movement were less likely to have an Apgar score <7 at 5 minutes (relative risk [RR]=0.56; 95% CI, 0.29-0.96; P=.05) and less likely to be preterm (RR=0.68; 95% CI, 0.48-0.94; P=.02). No significant difference in cesarean section for fetal distress or admission to the neonatal intensive care unit was noted between the study and control groups. The study suggests that maternal perception of decreased fetal movement is not associated with poor fetal outcome."
"Do statins cause myopathy
Muscle symptoms in patients who are treated with statins and have normal creatine kinase levels are not well understood. To report biopsy-confirmed myopathy and normal creatine kinase levels associated with statin use. Case reports from preliminary analysis of an ongoing clinical trial. Clinical research center in a community hospital. Four patients with muscle symptoms that developed during statin therapy and reversed during placebo use. 1) Patients' ability to identify blinded statin therapy and 2) standard measures of functional capacity and muscle strength. All four patients repeatedly distinguished blinded statin therapy from placebo. Strength testing confirmed weakness during statin therapy that reversed during placebo use. Muscle biopsies showed evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction, including abnormally increased lipid stores, fibers that did not stain for cytochrome oxidase activity, and ragged red fibers. These findings reversed in the three patients who had repeated biopsy when they were not receiving statins. Creatine kinase levels were normal in all four patients despite the presence of significant myopathy. Some patients who develop muscle symptoms while receiving statin therapy have demonstrable weakness and histopathologic findings of myopathy despite normal serum creatine kinase levels.","A small study of 21 patients on statins with muscle symptoms but normal creatine kinases described 4 patients who were able to distinguish statins from placebo, with objective reversible weakness and abnormal muscle biopsies."
"What environmental modifications improve pediatric asthma
Avoidance of exposure to indoor allergens is an important element in the treatment of allergic disease. The results of several studies provide strong evidence in support of a role for allergen avoidance; however, strategies that optimize allergen reduction in houses have not been determined. Complex issues regarding the efficacy of physical and chemical measures that target house dust mite, pet, and cockroach allergens in the home are discussed. The greatest challenge is to educate allergic patients so that they can play an important role in controlling their own disease.",Two authors reported that the use of chemicals for house dust mite control and the use of synthetic pillows in lieu of feather pillows may actually exacerbate asthma.
"Is screening urinalysis in children worthwhile
Screening children for asymptomatic bacteriuria to prevent pyelonephritis and renal scarring is widely recommended, but its cost-effectiveness has not been established. We reviewed published studies to determine the costs and benefits of screening toilet-trained, asymptomatic children for bacteriuria. Given the sensitivity and specificity of current screening methods (approximately 80% each) and the prevalence of bacteriuria in asymptomatic children (approximately 1% in girls and 0.03% in boys), screening 100,000 children would result in 19,897 (20%) false-positive tests; initial screening and two urine cultures to confirm the diagnosis of asymptomatic bacteriuria would miss 28% of 515 children with true bacteriuria, and cost nearly $2.9 million. There is no evidence that detection and treatment of children with asymptomatic bacteriuria prevents subsequent pyelonephritis or renal scarring. Screening for bacteriuria in asymptomatic children is costly, fails to prevent pyelonephritis or renal scarring, and should be discontinued as a part of routine well-child care.","Expert opinion varies as to the necessity of screening urinalysis. No prospective randomized trials demonstrate improved outcomes, and limited evidence suggests that detection and treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria improves long-term outcomes such as renal scarring, hypertension, or pyelone phritis."
"What evaluation is best for an isolated, enlarged cervical lymph node
To determine the diagnostic accuracy of cervical lymphadenopathy by fine needle aspiration (FNAC) and imprint cytology (IC). This study included 94 patients with cervical lymphadenopathy. This study was carried out in the Departments of General Surgery and Pathology, King Fahad Hospital, Hofuf, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, from June 2001 through to July 2002. They were subjected to clinical examination and FNAC of one of the enlarged lymph nodes. This was followed by IC and histological examination of this lymph node after its excision. Clinical examination was correct in 78% of the cases. The overall accuracy of fine needle aspiration was 93%. It was accurate on all cases of reactive hyperplasia, 93% of tuberculosis lymphadenitis, 90% in Hodgkin's lymphoma, 86% in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and 91% of metastasis lymphadenopathy. On the other hand, the overall accuracy of IC was higher than that of fine needle aspiration, being 97%. It diagnosed all cases of reactive hyperplasia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, 97% in tuberculosis lymphadenitis, 90% in Hodgkin's lymphoma and 95% in metastasis lymphadenopathy. These techniques proved to be reliable, rapid, and inexpensive procedures in diagnosis of lymphadenopathy. They can differentiate well between inflammatory and neoplastic lesions, in cases of lymphoma, cytological diagnosis should be followed by histological diagnosis for accurate classification and grading.","In a study of 309 patients with supraclavicular lymphadenopathy, fine-needle aspiration had a sensitivity of 97%, a specificity of 98%, and a positive predictive value of 98%. A study of 94 patients found that clinical exam alone was 78% sensitive in diagnosing the cause of lymphadenopathy; this improved to 93% sensitivity with fine-needle aspiration."
"What is the best way to diagnose a suspected rotator cuff tear
Rotator cuff tears account for almost 50% of major shoulder injuries but are sometimes difficult to diagnose. To aid diagnosis, we did a prospective study, comparing results of 23 clinical tests from 400 patients with and without rotator cuff tears. Three simple tests were predictive for rotator cuff tear: supraspinatus weakness, weakness in external rotation, and impingement. When all three were positive, or if two tests were positive and the patient was aged 60 or older, the individual had a 98% chance of having a rotator cuff tear; combined absence of these features excluded this diagnosis.","A prospective study of 400 patients comparing 23 different clinical exams found that 3 simple clinical tests-supraspinatus weakness, weakness in external rotation, and the presence of impingement-were highly predictive of rotator cuff tear. When all 3 tests were positive, or when 2 tests were positive for a patient aged >60 years, there was a 98% chance of the patient having a rotator cuff tear."
"Are there big differences among beta-blockers in treating essential hypertension
To quantify the effect of first-line antihypertensive treatment with beta-blockers on mortality, morbidity and withdrawal rates, compared with the other main classes of antihypertensive agents. We identified eligible trials by searching the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, Medline, Embase, reference lists of previous reviews, and contacting researchers. We extracted data independently in duplicate and conducted meta-analysis by analysing trial participants in groups to which they were randomized, regardless of subsequent treatment actually received. Thirteen trials with 91,561 participants, meeting inclusion criteria, compared beta-blockers to placebo (four trials; n = 23,613), diuretics (five trials; n = 18,241), calcium-channel blockers (CCBs) (four trials; n = 44,825), and renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors, namely angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (three trials; n = 10,828). Compared to placebo, beta-blockers reduced the risk of stroke (relative risk 0.80; 95% confidence interval 0.66-0.96) with a marginal fall in total cardiovascular events (0.88, 0.79-0.97), but did not affect all-cause mortality (0.99, 0.88-1.11), coronary heart disease (0.93, 0.81-1.07) or cardiovascular mortality (0.93, 0.80-1.09). The effect on stroke was less than that of CCBs (1.24, 1.11-1.40) and RAS inhibitors (1.30, 1.11-1.53), and that on total cardiovascular events less than that of CCBs (1.18, 1.08-1.29). In addition, patients on beta-blockers were more likely to discontinue treatment than those on diuretics (1.80; 1.33-2.42) or RAS inhibitors (1.41; 1.29-1.54). Beta-blockers are inferior to CCBs and to RAS inhibitors for reducing several important hard end points. Compared with diuretics, they had similar outcomes, but were less well tolerated. Hence beta-blockers are generally suboptimal first-line antihypertensive drugs.","A recent systematic review found beta blockers to be inferior to calcium channel blockers and renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (ACE inhibitors or ARBs) for major endpoints of all-cause mortality, coronary heart disease, stroke, total cardiovascular events, and cardiovascular mortality. This review found beta-blockers had similar outcomes as diuretics but were less well tolerated than diuretics (RR=1.80; 95% CI, 1.33-2.42) or renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RR=1.41; 1.29-1.54). Thirteen trials with 91,561 participants, meeting inclusion criteria, compared beta-blockers with placebo (4 trials; n=23,613), diuretics (5 trials; n=18,241), calcium-channel blockers (4 trials; n=44,825), and renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (3 trials; n=10,828). Compared with placebo, beta-blockers reduced the risk of stroke (RR=0.80; 95% CI, 0.66-0.96) with a marginal fall in total cardiovascular events (RR=0.88; 95% CI, 0.79-0.97), but did not affect all-cause mortality (RR=0.99, 0.88-1.11), coronary heart disease (RR=0.93, 0.81-1.07), or cardiovascular mortality (RR=0.93, 0.80-1.09). The effect on stroke was less than that of calcium-channel blockers (RR=1.24, 1.11-1.40) and renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RR=1.30, 1.11-1.53). The effect on total cardiovascular events was less than that of calcium-channel blockers (RR=1.18, 1.08-1.29)."
"What is the best oral antifungal medication for tinea capitis
Tinea capitis is one of the most common infections of children. The standard treatment is griseofulvin. Itraconazole and terbinafine have in large part replaced griseofulvin in the treatment of onychomycosis and, in addition to fluconazole and ketoconazole, are evolving treatments for tinea capitis. The purpose of this review is to compare the efficacy, safety, and cost of oral antifungal agents for tinea capitis. Small, open-label studies of itraconazole, terbinafine, and fluconazole have reported encouraging results, suggesting that these drugs may be effective alternatives to griseofulvin; however, in large controlled studies griseofulvin continues to exhibit greater or equal efficacy. Ketoconazole appears to be the least efficacious. All five drugs appear relatively safe, however, only griseofulvin has a long track record of safety, is Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for the treatment of tinea capitis in children, and has the least known drug interactions. Fluconazole is FDA approved for use in children more than 6 months of age, yet not for the treatment of tinea capitis. Oral griseofulvin and terbinafine tablets are the least expensive of the antifungal agents; griseofulvin suspension is, however, more expensive than fluconazole suspension. For the combined reasons of efficacy, safety, and cost, and a long track record of use, we feel oral griseofulvin is still the present treatment of choice for tinea capitis. Newer antifungals are currently under investigation, and their role in treating tinea capitis in children is still being defined.","The exact efficacy of any agent is difficult to determine, because most studies were small, used different doses and definitions of cure, and were conducted in different populations. With the exception of ketoconazole, all agents seem to have roughly similar efficacy and cure rates of approximately 70% to 80%. None of these agents require laboratory monitoring at the recommended lengths of treatment for tinea capitis."
"How can you help prevent a recurrence of diverticulitis
Previous studies suggest that elective colectomy is often required after an episode of acute diverticulitis. Acute diverticulitis initially treated nonoperatively does not require elective colectomy. Retrospective cohort study. Twelve Kaiser Permanente hospitals in Southern California. Three thousand one hundred sixty-five patients with acute diverticulitis. Colectomy or nonoperative treatment with or without percutaneous abscess drainage. Recurrent diverticulitis. Emergency colectomy was performed in 614 patients (19.4%). Nonoperative treatment was initially used in 2551 patients (80.6%). Of these, 185 patients (7.3%) had an elective colectomy and the remaining 2366 patients (92.7%) did not. Factors associated with undergoing elective colectomy compared with nonoperative treatment were younger age of the patient, fewer comorbidities, and percutaneous abscess drainage. Mean follow-up was 8.9 years, with a maximum of 12 years. After nonoperative treatment, 314 patients (13.3%) recurred-222 patients had a single recurrence and 92 patients had a rerecurrence. After adjusting for other variables, older age (hazard ratio, >/=50 years vs <50 years = 0.68; 95% confidence interval, 0.53-0.87) was associated with a lower recurrence, whereas higher comorbidity was associated with higher recurrence. Gender and percutaneous abscess drainage had no influence on recurrence. All 92 rerecurrences were treated nonoperatively. The risk of a rerecurrence (29.3%) was significantly higher than a first recurrence (P<.001). Age, gender, Charlson comorbidity index, and percutaneous abscess drainage did not predict rerecurrence. Very few patients with acute diverticulitis treated nonoperatively have recurrence. Younger age was associated with recurrence. A first recurrence was the only factor that predicted rerecurrences. The low recurrence rate argues against routine elective colectomy after successful nonoperative management of acute diverticulitis.","One large retrospective study followed 3165 patients for 6 to 12 years after hospitalization for diverticulitis. Of the patients treated nonoperatively, 13% had a single recurrence and 4% had multiple recurrences; the annual recurrence rate was approximately 2%. The authors concluded that routine elective colectomy is rarely indicated after a first episode of uncomplicated acute diverticulitis."
"What does the evidence tell us about treating very-high-risk patients to an low density lipoprotein <70 mg/dL
Previous trials have demonstrated that lowering low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels below currently recommended levels is beneficial in patients with acute coronary syndromes. We prospectively assessed the efficacy and safety of lowering LDL cholesterol levels below 100 mg per deciliter (2.6 mmol per liter) in patients with stable coronary heart disease (CHD). A total of 10,001 patients with clinically evident CHD and LDL cholesterol levels of less than 130 mg per deciliter (3.4 mmol per liter) were randomly assigned to double-blind therapy and received either 10 mg or 80 mg of atorvastatin per day. Patients were followed for a median of 4.9 years. The primary end point was the occurrence of a first major cardiovascular event, defined as death from CHD, nonfatal non-procedure-related myocardial infarction, resuscitation after cardiac arrest, or fatal or nonfatal stroke. The mean LDL cholesterol levels were 77 mg per deciliter (2.0 mmol per liter) during treatment with 80 mg of atorvastatin and 101 mg per deciliter (2.6 mmol per liter) during treatment with 10 mg of atorvastatin. The incidence of persistent elevations in liver aminotransferase levels was 0.2 percent in the group given 10 mg of atorvastatin and 1.2 percent in the group given 80 mg of atorvastatin (P<0.001). A primary event occurred in 434 patients (8.7 percent) receiving 80 mg of atorvastatin, as compared with 548 patients (10.9 percent) receiving 10 mg of atorvastatin, representing an absolute reduction in the rate of major cardiovascular events of 2.2 percent and a 22 percent relative reduction in risk (hazard ratio, 0.78; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.69 to 0.89; P<0.001). There was no difference between the two treatment groups in overall mortality. Intensive lipid-lowering therapy with 80 mg of atorvastatin per day in patients with stable CHD provides significant clinical benefit beyond that afforded by treatment with 10 mg of atorvastatin per day. This occurred with a greater incidence of elevated aminotransferase levels.","The Treating to New Targets (TNT) study showed that in patients with stable CHD, intensive lipid lowering with atorvastatin 80 mg daily delivered significant clinical benefit beyond that provided by atorvastatin 10 mg daily. The mean low density lipoprotein achieved in treating to new targets was 77 mg/dL on 80 mg atorvastatin, compared with 101 mg/dL on 10 mg. Patients with diabetes who took 80 mg had a 2.26% absolute risk reduction for major cardiovascular events (number needed to treat=43). Secondary outcomes-including all cardiovascular events, cerebrovascular events, and congestive heart failure with hospitalization-also improved on 80 mg atorvastatin. Although this study enrolled a total of 10,001 patients with clinically evident CHD, it was not sufficiently powered to demonstrate differences in overall mortality between the 2 groups. While it is clear that patients in the 80-mg group had better outcomes than patients in the lower-dose group, the exact role of low density lipoprotein lowering cannot be easily separated from other potentially beneficial effects of the higher dose of atorvastatin."
"How should you treat Candida vaginitis in patients on antibiotics
Although it is the second most common vaginal infection in North America, vulvovaginal candidiasis is a non-notifiable disease and has been excluded from the ranks of sexually transmitted diseases. Not surprisingly, vulvovaginal candidiasis has received scant attention by public health authorities, funding agencies, and researchers. Epidemiologic data on risk factors and pathogenic mechanisms remain inadequately studied. Most important, standards of care, including diagnosis and therapy, remain undefined. A conference was held in April 1996 to define and summarize what is known and supported by scientific data in the areas of epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis; but, more important, the conference aimed at defining what is not known, poorly studied, and controversial. Guidelines for the treatment and diagnosis of the different forms of vulvovaginal candidiasis are suggested.","Antibiotics are thought to increase risk of vulvovaginal candidiasis by killing endogenous vaginal flora (particularly Lactobacillus), allowing microorganisms resistant to the antibiotics, like Candida, to flourish."
"What is the most beneficial diet for patients with diverticulosis
To review recent evidence on dietary factors associated with diverticular disease (DD) with special emphasis on dietary fibre. MEDLINE was searched from January 1966 to December 2001 for articles on the relationship between dietary and other lifestyle factors and DD. Most articles either focused on dietary intervention in treating symptomatic DD or were case-control studies with inherent limitations for studying diet-disease associations. Only one large prospective study of male health professionals in the United States assessed diet at baseline and before initial diagnosis of DD. A diet high in fibre mainly from fruits and vegetables and low in total fat and red meat decreases risk of DD. Evidence indicates that the insoluble component of fibre is strongly associated with lower risk of DD; this association was particularly strong for cellulose. Caffeine and alcohol do not substantially increase risk of DD, nor does obesity, but higher levels of physical activity seem to reduce risk of DD. A diet high in fibre and low in total fat and red meat and a lifestyle with more physical activity might help prevent DD.","Because of strong epidemiological evidence that people from cultures with high-fiber diets are far less likely to develop diverticulosis than are people who live in cultures of low-fiber diets, it has been assumed that a diet high in fiber can prevent diverticulosis. Many small, uncontrolled studies have also investigated the effect of high-fiber diets and supplements on symptoms of diverticulosis and prevention of diverticulitis episodes."
"Is pneumococcal vaccine effective in nursing home patients
Three randomized controlled trials of the effectiveness of pneumococcal vaccine in elderly and chronically ill adults in the United States have failed to show significant protective efficacy during 44,213 person-years of follow-up. Case-control studies have greater statistical power to detect significant prevention of rare diseases such as pneumococcal bacteremia, but they also have a greater susceptibility to bias, necessitating consistent results from multiple studies. Three case-control studies at two different universities have shown prevention of systemic infection, but another study found no benefit. Patients with pneumococcal bacteremia who were at least 2 years old and had chronic illness indicating the need for pneumococcal vaccine, or who were at least 65 years old were compared with matched control subjects for frequency of prior vaccination. Matching variables included date of admission, age, sex, race, type and duration of chronic illness serving as the major vaccine indication, number of vaccine indications and number of medical hospitalizations since licensure of the pneumococcal vaccine in 1978, and type of primary medical care. Pneumococcal vaccination was documented in the records of six (7%) of 85 cases and 26 (17%) of 152 control subjects, suggesting 81% efficacy in conditional logistical regression analysis (95% confidence interval, 34% to 94%, P = .008). Four case-control studies at three universities have now demonstrated significant protective efficacy of pneumococcal vaccine for preventing pneumococcal bacteremia. The development of antibiotic-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae indicates an urgent need for an increased rate of vaccination among high-risk patients and for the development of more immunogenic conjugate vaccines that may enhance efficacy among elderly and immunocompromised patients as well as infants.","Farr and colleagues found efficacy of 70% (95% confidence interval [CI], 37%-86%) among 2 groups of patients: those ≥ 2 years of age with chronic disease or those ≥ 65 years."
"Which patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) should have esophagogastroduoudenoscopy (EGD)
Endoscopy is often performed in patients with gastroesophageal reflux (GER) disease because of concern about the presence of Barrett's esophagus (BE). The purpose of this study was to determine whether the duration of GER symptoms and/or a history of esophagitis was associated with an increased risk of BE. This was an observational, prospective, community-based study. Consecutive patients undergoing elective endoscopy because of GER symptoms were enrolled. Endoscopy reports and pathological findings were reviewed to classify patients as having no esophagitis, esophagitis, or probable BE. Correlations with duration of symptoms and a history of esophagitis were analyzed. In all, 701 of 2641 patients (27%) undergoing elective endoscopy had GER symptoms, and 77 of these patients had probable BE. Compared with patients with GER symptoms for less than 1 yr, the odds ratio for BE in patients with GER symptoms for 1-5 years was 3.0 and increased to 6.4 in patients with symptoms for more than 10 yr (p < 0.001). A history of esophagitis was not an independent risk factor for BE (p = 0.17). Prevalence of BE is strongly associated with duration of GER symptoms.","A total of 701 patients referred for EGD by gastroenterologists for gastroesophageal reflux disease symptoms yielded 77 cases of Barrett's esophagus. Compared with patients without Barrett's esophagus, patients with the condition were more likely to have symptoms greater than 1 year: 1 to 5 years (OR=3.0 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.2-8.0]), 5 to 10 years [OR=5.1 (95% CI, 1.2-14.7)], more than 10 years [OR=6.4 (95% CI, 2.4-17.10)]."
"Is screening urinalysis in children worthwhile
To study awareness of urinary tract infections (UTIs) by determining the diagnostic rate of first UTI in children <2 years of age and to estimate the minimum incidence. Twenty-six of a total of 43 pediatric centers participated in the study. Sixty-four percent of the total childhood population <2 years of age was covered. The number of all children included in the study was used to calculate the diagnostic rate. Only UTI confirmed by either suprapubic aspiration (any growth) or midstream or bag samples with >/=100 000 bacteria/mL, together with a positive nitrite reaction, was used to estimate the minimum incidence. The mean diagnostic rate was 1.5% for boys (range, 0.7%-3.0%) and 1.7% for girls (range, 0.7%-2.9%). The diagnostic rate was significantly higher in June than in December. The mean incidence was 1.0% for both boys and girls (range, 0.3%-3.0% and 0.4%-2.9%, respectively). The minimum cumulative incidence at 2 years of age was estimated to be 2.2% for boys and 2.1% for girls. This study suggests a high UTI awareness in Sweden as indicated by a higher diagnostic rate and, despite stricter diagnostic criteria, a higher incidence of UTI in children <2 years of age than previously reported. It is suggested that a high UTI awareness may reduce chronic renal failure because of pyelonephritic renal scarring.",The prevalence of urinary tract infection in childhood has been estimated to be roughly 1%.
"Does surgery for carpal tunnel syndrome improve outcomes
To compare the efficacy of local steroid injection and open carpal tunnel release, a symptom and functional status questionnaire (Boston Questionnaire) and sensory and motor nerve conduction studies were performed in 90 patients with electrophysiologically proven idiopathic carpal tunnel syndrome, of whom 44 were treated surgically and 46 by two-dose steroid injection. Electrophysiologic studies and the Boston Questionnaire were applied before and at the 3rd and 6th months after treatment. Both groups showed significant improvement at first follow-up. The surgically treated group showed a significant and further improvement of symptoms and conduction values between the 3rd- and 6th-month evaluations, whereas no significant change was observed in the patient group treated by steroid injection. By the end of follow-up, 5% of the hands in the open carpal tunnel release (OCTR) group and 13% of the hands in the local steroid injection (LSIG) group showed electrophysiological worsening, and 5% of the hands in the OCTR group and 22% of the hands in the LSIG group showed symptomatic worsening. Our results show that steroid injection provides an improvement comparable with that from surgical release of the median nerve at a 3-month interval. However, this improvement is not long-lasting.","One cohort study of 90 patients concluded that with respect to symptom control and return to function, open release surgery was as effective as local steroid injection at 1 month follow-up.3 However, at 4 to 6 months after the operation, surgery patients were found to have significantly improved symptom and function scores, with continued improvement compared with patients who received the steroid injection. In this study the patients' pretreatment symptom and functioning scores were worse in the surgery group than in the nonsurgical group. The investigators in this study did not report controlling for these scores."
"What is the best way to identify patients with white-coat hypertension
To investigate whether measurement of blood pressure at home (HBP) and by ambulatory monitoring (ABP) are reliable alternatives to the traditional strategy for the diagnosis of hypertension based on blood pressure measurement on repeated clinic visits (CBP). Comparison of the diagnosis of hypertension based on HBP (on six workdays) or ABP monitoring (two occasions) with that based on CBP (five visits within 3 months). Outpatient hypertension clinic. We enrolled 133 individuals with a diastolic CBP of 90-115 mmHg on the initial visit. CBP, HBP and ABP values, and the diagnosis of hypertension. Hypertension was diagnosed in 70, 63 and 56% of individuals using the CBP, ABP and HBP methods respectively (P = 0.04). Agreement in the diagnosis of hypertension between all three methods was found in 59% of individuals. Disagreement between CBP and ABP was found in 27%, between CBP and HBP in 29% and between ABP and HBP in 26% of individuals. The sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative predictive values of ABP to diagnose hypertension correctly were 76, 67, 85 and 53% respectively; for HBP the respective values were 69, 77, 88 and 51%. The same parameters for HBP compared with ABP in the detection of white-coat hypertension were 61, 79, 48 and 86% respectively. Indiscriminate use of HBP or ABP monitoring in the evaluation of all individuals with high blood pressure will probably result in confusion and therefore should be discouraged. However, in the detection of white-coat hypertension, HBP appears to be useful as a screening test, which, if positive, requires confirmation with ABP monitoring.","In a study that enrolled patients from a hypertension clinic, 133 untreated patients with dias-tolic blood pressure 90 to 115 mm Hg underwent ambulatory blood pressure monitoring for a reference standard. The sensitivity of home blood pressure monitoring in identifying white-coat hypertension was 61% and the PV+ was 48%."
"What's the best treatment for cradle cap
Pityrosporum ovale appears to play an important role in the pathogenesis of seborrhoeic dermatitis. Ketoconazole is an antimycotic agent with a high in vitro and in vivo efficacy against P. ovale. We performed a multicentre study to investigate the efficacy of ketoconazole 2% shampoo in the treatment and prophylaxis of seborrhoeic dermatitis and dandruff. Five hundred and seventy-five patients presenting with moderate to severe seborrhoeic dermatitis and dandruff of the scalp were treated with 2% ketoconazole shampoo twice weekly for 2-4 weeks, producing an excellent response in 88%. Of those patients who responded, 312 were included in a prophylactic phase, lasting 6 months. These patients were treated with the active preparation (shampoo containing 2% ketoconazole) once-weekly, once every other week, alternating with placebo (shampoo without ketoconazole), or with placebo only once-weekly. Forty-eight (47%) patients in the placebo group experienced a relapse of seborrhoeic dermatitis, compared with 23 (19%) patients in the active treatment group, and 31 (31%) patients in the active/placebo group. The medication was well tolerated in all three groups. We conclude that ketoconazole 2% shampoo is highly effective, not only in clearing scalp seborrhoeic dermatitis and dandruff, but also in preventing relapse of the disease when used prophylactically once weekly.","An uncontrolled multicenter trial with 575 adults found ketoconazole shampoo was superior to placebo for treatment of scalp seborrheic dermatitis with an 88% ""excellent response"" rate (P<.0001, no relative risk or confidence intervals given)."
"What drugs are best for bipolar depression
This study evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of quetiapine monotherapy for depressive episodes in patients with bipolar I or II disorder (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition) who were randomized to 8 weeks of double-blind treatment with quetiapine (300 or 600 mg/d; once daily, evening dosing) or placebo. Patients were assessed weekly using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D). The primary end point was change in MADRS total score from baseline to Week 8 (analysis of covariance/last-observation-carried-forward analysis). Of 509 patients randomized, 59% completed the study. Improvements from baseline in mean MADRS total scores were significantly greater with quetiapine 300 and 600 mg/d than with placebo from first evaluation (Week 1) through Week 8 (both P <or= 0.001 vs. placebo). Therapeutic effect sizes at Week 8 were 0.61 and 0.54 for quetiapine 300 and 600 mg/d, respectively. Improvements in mean HAM-D scores were also significantly greater with both quetiapine doses than with placebo (P < 0.001) as early as Week 1 and throughout the study. The MADRS response and remission rates were also significantly greater in both quetiapine dose groups compared with placebo. Improvements in primary and secondary outcomes were observed with both 300 and 600 mg/d quetiapine without major differences between the doses. Common adverse events included dry mouth, sedation, somnolence, dizziness, and constipation. The incidence of treatment-emergent mania or hypomania was lower with quetiapine treatment than placebo. This study demonstrates that quetiapine monotherapy is an effective and well-tolerated treatment for depressive episodes in bipolar disorder, confirming the results observed from a previous study (BipOLar DEpRession [BOLDER] I).","In an RCT, 509 patients were randomized to double-blind treatment with quetiapine (300 or 600 mg/day) or placebo and assessed weekly with the montgomery-asberg depression rating scale and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS).6 Improvements in mean hamilton depression rating scale scores were greater with both quetiapine doses than with placebo (P<.001). Clinical effect sizes were moderate at week 8 (0.61 at 300 mg/day and 0.54 at 600 mg/day), although dose titration effects were not established."
"What is the best treatment for pertussis
The worldwide incidence of whooping cough (pertussis) has been estimated at 48.5 million cases and nearly 295,000 deaths per year. In low-income countries, the case-fatality rate among infants may be as high as 4%. Much of the morbidity of whooping cough in children and adults is due to the effects of the paroxysmal cough. Cough treatments proposed include corticosteroids, beta 2-adrenergic agonists, pertussis-specific immunoglobulin, antihistamines and possibly leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs). To assess the effectiveness and safety of interventions to reduce the severity of paroxysmal cough in whooping cough in children and adults. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2009, issue 1), which contains the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register and the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE); MEDLINE (1950 to March 2009); EMBASE (1980 to March 2009); AMED (1985 to March 2009); CINAHL (1982 to March 2009) and LILACS (March 2009). Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs of any intervention (excluding antibiotics and vaccines) to suppress the cough in whooping cough. Two review authors (SB, MT) independently selected trials, extracted data and assessed the quality of each trial. The primary outcome was frequency of paroxysms of coughing. Secondary outcomes were frequency of vomiting, frequency of whoop, frequency of cyanosis (turning blue), development of serious complications, mortality from any cause, side effects due to medication, admission to hospital and duration of hospital stay. Ten trials were included of varying sample sizes (N = 9 to 135) from high-income countries. Study quality was generally poor. Included studies did not show a statistically significant benefit for any of the interventions. Diphenhydramine did not change coughing episodes; the mean difference of coughing spells per 24 hours was 1.9 (95% confidence interval (CI) - 4.7 to 8.5). One study on pertussis immunoglobulin reported a possible mean reduction of -3.1 whoops per 24 hours (95% CI -6.2 to 0.02) but no change in hospital stay (-0.7 days) (95% CI -3.8 to 2.4). Dexamethasone did not show a clear decrease in length of hospital stay (-3.5 days) (95% CI -15.3 to 8.4) and salbutamol showed no change in coughing paroxysms per 24 hours (-0.22) (95% CI -4.13 to 3.69). Insufficient evidence exists to draw conclusions about the effects of interventions for the cough in whooping cough.","A Cochrane review of 8 trials examined the effectiveness of the symptomatic treatment of cough in children and adults with pertussis. There were many problems with the methodological quality of these trials, including small sample sizes and poor reporting of the methods. Diphenhydramine, pertussis immunoglobulin, corticosteroids and salbutamol were compared with placebo. There were no statistically significant differences in coughing paroxysms, mean number of whoops per 24 hours or in duration of hospital stay between these interventions and placebo."
"How should patients with Barrett's esophagus be monitored
Adenocarcinoma of the esophagus and the gastroesophageal junction is the twentieth most common malignancy in the United States. In developed countries, the incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma is increasing 5% to 10% per year. Despite the use of endoscopy for earlier detection, mortality from esophageal adenocarcinoma has not declined. Using an evidence-based approach, we review screening methods for esophageal adenocarcinoma, including the use of a symptom questionnaire, identification of patients with a family history of Barrett's esophagus, peroral or transnasal endoscopy, barium swallow, fecal occult blood testing, and brush and balloon cytology. Screening has not been shown to reduce rate of progression of Barrett's esophagus to esophageal cancer. Many treatment options for dysplastic Barrett's esophagus or early carcinoma appear effective, but long-term follow-up data are not available. There is currently insufficient evidence supporting population-based screening for Barrett's esophagus. Several risk factors, including severe reflux symptoms, male sex, and obesity, may identify patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease who are at the greatest risk of the development of cancer.","A systematic review assessing screening tools for esophageal carcinoma found standard endoscopy to be superior (90%-100% sensitivity) to other less invasive methods such as questionnaire (60%-70%), and fecal occult blood testing (20%). Additional endoscopy tools such as brush and balloon cytology increased the cost of surveillance without any improvement in diagnostic yield."
"What is the best treatment for plantar fasciitis
Extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) is increasingly used for plantar fasciitis, but limited evidence supports its use. To determine whether ultrasound-guided ESWT reduces pain and improves function in patients with plantar fasciitis. Double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial conducted between April 1999 and June 2001. Participants were recruited from the community-based referring physicians (primary care physicians, rheumatologists, orthopedic surgeons, and sports physicians) of a radiology group in Melbourne, Australia. We screened 178 patients and enrolled 166; 160 completed the 15-week protocol. Entry criteria included age at least 18 years with plantar fasciitis, defined as heel pain maximal over the plantar aspect of the foot of at least 6 weeks' duration, and an ultrasound-confirmed lesion, defined as thickening of the origin of the plantar fascia of at least 4 mm, hypoechogenicity, and alterations in the normal fibrillary pattern. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either ultrasound-guided ESWT given weekly for 3 weeks to a total dose of at least 1000 mJ/mm(2) (n = 81), or identical placebo to a total dose of 6.0 mJ/mm(2) (n = 85). Overall, morning, and activity pain, measured on a visual analog scale; Maryland Foot Score; walking ability; Short-Form-36 Health Survey (SF-36) score; and Problem Elicitation Technique score, measured at 6 and 12 weeks after treatment completion. At 6 and 12 weeks, there were significant improvements in overall pain in both the active group and placebo group (mean [SD] improvement, 18.1 [30.6] and 19.8 [33.7] at 6 weeks [P =.74 for between-group difference], and 26.3 [34.8] and 25.7 [34.9] at 12 weeks [P =.99], respectively). Similar improvements in both groups were also observed for morning and activity pain, walking ability, Maryland Foot Score, Problem Elicitation Technique, and SF-36. There were no statistically significant differences in the degree of improvement between treatment groups for any measured outcomes. We found no evidence to support a beneficial effect on pain, function, and quality of life of ultrasound-guided ESWT over placebo in patients with ultrasound-proven plantar fasciitis 6 and 12 weeks following treatment.","One randomized controlled study of 166 patients found no evidence to support a beneficial effect on pain, function, and quality of life of extracorporeal shock wave therapy over a sham treatment. Of note, this study enrolled patients who had a minimum of 6 weeks of symptoms. All recommendations in the US are to reserve extracorporeal shock wave therapy for patients with more than 6 months of symptoms."
"Are beta-2-agonists or anticholinergics more effective for treating COPD
One of the major goals of bronchodilator therapy in patients with COPD is to decrease airflow limitation in the airways and, as a consequence, improve dyspnea and exercise tolerance. The focus of this systematic review is to assess the effects of treatment with beta-agonists, anticholinergics, and theophyllines on dyspnea, and steady-state and incremental exercise capacity. Thirty-three, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled studies written in English were selected. This review shows that approximately half of the studies showed a significant effect of bronchodilator therapy on exercise capacity. Anticholinergic agents have significant beneficial effects in the majority of studies, especially when measured by steady-state exercise protocols. There is a trend toward a better effect of high-dose compared to low-dose anticholinergics. Short-acting beta(2)-mimetics have favorable effects on exercise capacity in more than two thirds of the studies; surprisingly, the situation is less clear for long-acting beta(2)-agents. The majority of the results of the published reports on theophyllines and their effects on exercise are negative. Direct comparisons of different classes of bronchodilators have not been made in a sufficient number of studies for a rational preference. The addition of a second bronchodilator has no proven advantage for improving exercise test results, but this has not been studied extensively and not in sufficiently large studies. The majority of studies reporting a measure of dyspnea found improvements, even in the absence of improvement in exercise capacity.","A review of 33 double-blind randomized placebo-controlled studies showed a significant effect of bronchodilator therapy on exercise capacity in COPD patients in about one half of studies. Anticholinergic agents had significant beneficial effects in the majority, and these effects tended to be somewhat dose-dependent. Short-acting β2-agonists improved exercise capacity in more than two thirds of the studies, but long-acting agents led to mixed outcomes. The researchers identified no superior agent between the 2 classes, citing a lack of adequate studies making a direct comparison."
"What is the best approach for managing recurrent bacterial vaginosis
Bacterial vaginosis is an imbalance of the normal vaginal flora with an overgrowth of anaerobic bacteria and a lack of the normal lactobacillary flora. Bacterial vaginosis during pregnancy has been associated with poor perinatal outcome and, in particular, preterm birth. Identification and treatment may reduce the risk of preterm birth and its consequences. To assess the effects of antibiotic treatment of bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy. We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group trials register (September 2002). Randomized trials comparing antibiotic treatment with placebo or no treatment, or comparing two or more antibiotic regimens in pregnant women with bacterial vaginosis. Two reviewers assessed trials and extracted data independently. Study authors were contacted for additional information. Ten trials involving 4249 women were included; all were of good quality. Antibiotic therapy was effective at eradicating bacterial vaginosis during pregnancy (odds ratio (OR) 0.21, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.18 to 0.24, eight trials of 3825 women). Treatment did not significantly reduce the risk of preterm birth before 37 weeks (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.10, eight trials of 4062 women), 34 weeks (OR 1.20, 95% CI 0.69 to 2.07, five trials of 851 women), or 32 weeks (OR 1.08, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.68, three trials of 3080 women). However, antibiotic treatment did significantly decrease the risk of preterm prelabour rupture of membranes (OR 0.32, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.67, three trials of 562 women). In women with a previous preterm birth, treatment did not affect the risk of subsequent preterm birth (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.17, five trials of 622 women) but it did decrease the risk of preterm prelabour rupture of membranes (OR 0.14, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.38, two trials of 114 women) and low birthweight (OR 0.31, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.75, five trials of 622 women). Antibiotic treatment can eradicate bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy. However, the current evidence does not support screening and treating all pregnant women with asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis to prevent preterm birth and its consequences. For women with a previous preterm birth, there is little suggestion that detection and treatment of bacterial vaginosis will prevent a further preterm birth, but it may reduce the risk of low birthweight and preterm prelabour rupture of membranes.","The CDC reviewers identified causal relationships between bacterial vaginosis and plasmacell endometritis, postpartum fever, and posthysterectomy vaginal-cuff cellulitis. They therefore concluded it is reasonable to try to prevent post-procedure infections by treating women who have asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis before hysterectomy or pregnancy termination. Although bacterial vaginosis has been associated with preterm labor, trials evaluating treatment of bacterial vaginosis to prevent preterm delivery are conflicting. A Cochrane review of bacterial vaginosis and preterm labor suggests treating women at high risk for preterm birth may reduce the risk of low birthweight and preterm prelabor rupture of membranes."
"What are effective treatments for panic disorder
There is a paucity of long-term outcome studies of panic disorder that exceed a 2-year follow-up. The aim of the study was to evaluate the long-term follow-up of patients with panic disorder with agoraphobia treated according to a standardized protocol. A consecutive series of 200 patients satisfying the DSM-IV criteria for panic disorder with agoraphobia was treated in an out-patient clinic with behavioural methods based on exposure homework. One hundred and thirty-six patients became panic free after 12 sessions of psychotherapy and 132 were available for follow-up. A 2- to 14-year (median = 8 years) follow-up was performed. Survival analysis was employed to characterize the clinical course of patients. Thirty-one of the 132 patients (23%) had a relapse of panic disorder at some time during follow-up. The estimated cumulative percentage of patients remaining in remission was 93.1 after 2 years, 82.4 after 5 years, 78.8 after 7 years and 62.1 after 10 years. Such probabilities increased with younger age, and in the absence of a personality disorder, of high pre-treatment levels of depressed mood, of residual agoraphobic avoidance after exposure, and of concurrent use of benzodiazepines and antidepressant drugs. The findings suggest that exposure treatment can provide lasting relief to the majority of patients with panic disorder and agoraphobia. Disappearance of residual and subclinical agoraphobic avoidance, and not simply of panic attacks, should be the aim of exposure therapy.",Behavioral therapy with exposure homework has good long-term results.
"Do antipyretics prolong febrile illness
A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted to study the effects of over-the-counter analgesic/antipyretic medications on virus shedding, immune response, and clinical status in the common cold. Sixty healthy volunteers were challenged intranasally with rhinovirus type 2 and randomized to one of four treatment arms: aspirin, acetaminophen, ibuprofen, or placebo. Fifty-six volunteers were successfully infected and shed virus on at least 4 days after challenge. Virus shedding, antibody levels, clinical symptoms and signs, and blood leukocyte levels were carefully monitored. Use of aspirin and acetaminophen was associated with suppression of serum neutralizing antibody response (P less than .05 vs. placebo) and increased nasal symptoms and signs (P less than .05 vs. placebo). A concomitant rise in circulating monocytes suggested that the suppression of antibody response may be mediated through drug effects on monocytes and/or mononuclear phagocytes. There were no significant differences in viral shedding among the four groups, but a trend toward longer duration of virus shedding was observed in the aspirin and acetaminophen groups.","A randomized controlled trial involving 60 volunteers given intranasal rhinovirus type 2 monitored the effect of aspirin, acetaminophen, ibuprofen, or placebo on virus shedding, immune response, and clinical status. There was no difference in duration of illness. There was a trend toward longer duration of virus shedding in the aspirin and acetaminophen groups, but serum neutralizing antibody response was suppressed (P<.05 vs placebo). Aspirin and acetaminophen worsened symptoms of turbinate edema and nasal obstruction (P<.05 vs placebo)."
"Do beta-blockers worsen respiratory status for patients with COPD
Beta-blocker therapy has a proven mortality benefit in patients with hypertension, heart failure and coronary artery disease, as well as during the perioperative period. These drugs have traditionally been considered contraindicated in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). To assess the effect of cardioselective beta-blockers on respiratory function of patients with COPD. A comprehensive search of the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register (derived from systematic searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL) was carried out to identify randomised blinded controlled trials from 1966 to May 2005. We did not exclude trials on the basis of language. Randomised, blinded, controlled trials of single dose or longer duration that studied the effects of cardioselective beta-blockers on the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) or symptoms in patients with COPD. Two independent reviewers extracted data from the selected articles, reconciling differences by consensus. Two interventions studied were the administration of beta-blocker, given either as a single dose or for longer duration, and the use of beta2-agonist given after the study drug. Eleven studies of single-dose treatment and 9 of treatment for longer durations, ranging from 2 days to 12 weeks, met selection criteria. Cardioselective beta-blockers, given as a single dose or for longer duration, produced no change in FEV1 or respiratory symptoms compared to placebo, and did not affect the FEV1 treatment response to beta2-agonists. A subgroup analysis revealed no change in results for those participants with severe chronic airways obstruction or for those with a reversible obstructive component. Cardioselective beta-blockers, given to patients with COPD in the identified studies did not produce adverse respiratory effects. Given their demonstrated benefit in conditions such as heart failure, coronary artery disease and hypertension, cardioselective beta-blockers should not be routinely withheld from patients with COPD.","A 2004 meta-analysis synthesized the data of 19 clinical controlled trials that compared active therapy with either placebo or prior-to-treatment controls, assessing differences in FEV1, response to a beta2-agonist, and patient-reported respiratory symptoms. Trials included in the meta-analysis used cardioselective beta-blockers and evaluated either single-dose treatments or therapy of longer duration (2 days to 3.3 months). The authors concluded that patients with COPD who received cardioselective beta-blockers (such as metoprolol, atenolol, or bisoprolol) did not experience a statistically significant short-term deterioration in FEV1, worsening of COPD symptoms, or decreased responsiveness to beta2-agonists. The authors reported similar results for an analysis restricted to only those patients with severe COPD. This meta-analysis was limited by the relatively small number of participants (N=141 in single-dose treatment studies; N=126 in studies of longer duration treatment) in the handful of eligible studies. Consequently, rare or minimally harmful effects could have gone undetected."
"For those intolerant to angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors and ARBs, what is the best therapy for reducing the risk of diabetic nephropathy
Numerous studies suggest that the dihydropyridine calcium antagonists (DCAs) and nondihydropyridine calcium antagonists (NDCAs) have differential antiproteinuric effects. Proteinuria reduction is a correlate of the progression of renal disease. In an earlier systematic review, calcium antagonists were shown as effective antihypertensive drugs, but there was uncertainty about their renal benefits in patients with proteinuria and renal insufficiency. A systematic review was conducted to assess the differential effects of DCAs and NDCAs on proteinuria in hypertensive adults with proteinuria, with or without diabetes, and to determine whether these differential effects translate into altered progression of nephropathy. Studies included in the review had to be randomized clinical trials with at least 6 months of treatment, include a DCA or NDCA treatment arm, have one or more renal end points, and have been initiated after 1986. Summary data were extracted from 28 studies entered into two identical but separate databases, which were compared and evaluated by independent reviewers. The effects of each drug class on blood pressure (N= 1338) and proteinuria (N= 510) were assessed. After adjusting for sample size, study length, and baseline value, there were no statistically significant differences in the ability of either class of calcium antagonist to decrease blood pressure. The mean change in proteinuria was +2% for DCAs and -30% for NDCAs (95% CI, 10% to 54%, P= 0.01). Consistently greater reductions in proteinuria were associated with the use of NDCAs compared with DCAs, despite no significant differences in blood pressure reduction or presence of diabetes. This analysis supports (1) similar efficacy between subclasses of calcium antagonists to lower blood pressure, and (2) greater reductions in proteinuria by NDCAs compared to DCAs in the presence or absence of diabetes. Based on these findings, NDCAs, alone or in combination with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), are suggested as preferred agents to lower blood pressure in hypertensive patients with nephropathy associated with proteinuria.","According to a systematic review, NDCAs cause a greater reduction in proteinuria compared with DCAs (dihydropyridine calcium antagonists, such as nifedipine and amlodipine), although there was no significant differences in lowering blood pressure. Mean change in proteinuria was +2% for DCAs and -30% for NDCAs (95% confidence interval [CI], 10%-54%; P=.01)."
"Do insulin-sensitizing drugs increase ovulation rates for women with PCOS
This paper is a systematic review of metformin versus clomiphene citrate (CC) in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Meta-analysis Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) and QUality Of Reporting Of Meta-analyses (QUOROM) guidelines were followed. A systematic computerized literature search was done of seven bibliographic databases. Inclusion criteria included cohort and randomized controlled trials (RCT) of women with PCOS and the following medications: metformin versus placebo; metformin versus CC; metformin plus CC versus placebo plus CC. Rev-man 4.1 and Metaview 4.0 were used to analyse data. Relative risk (RR) estimates were presented. A chi2-test determined the significance of the association. Heterogeneity was determined by the Cochran Q-test. Metformin was 50% better than placebo for ovulation induction in infertile PCOS patients [RR 1.50; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.13, 1.99]. Metformin was also of benefit in non-infertile (i.e. patients with PCOS who were not complaining of infertility) PCOS patients for cycle regulation compared to placebo (RR 1.45; CI 1.11, 1.90). Metformin was not of confirmed benefit versus placebo for achievement of pregnancy (RR 1.07; CI 0.20, 5.74). Metformin plus CC may be 3-4-fold superior to CC alone for ovulation induction (RR 3.04; CI 1.77, 5.24) and pregnancy (RR 3.65; CI 1.11, 11.99) in women with PCOS. Metformin is effective for ovulation induction and cycle regulation in this group of patients. Metformin plus CC appears to be very effective for achievement of pregnancy compared to CC alone. No RCTs directly compare metformin to CC but the need for such a trial exists.","A meta-analysis of eight RCTs addressing the use of metformin or clomiphene for treatment of PCOS were reviewed for ovulation and pregnancy rates. Metformin is 50% better than placebo for ovulation induction among infertile PCOS patients (relative risk [RR]=1.50; 95% CI, 1.31-1.99), but this benefit is not necessarily improved with longer duration (>3 months) of therapy (RR=1.37; 95% CI, 1.05-1.79). Also, metformin is beneficial in regulating cycles for fertile PCOS patients with irregular menses (RR=1.45; 95% CI, 1.11-1.90)."
"How does venous thromboembolism risk for the patch and vaginal ring compare with oral contraceptives
There is concern that a new transdermal contraceptive patch containing ethinyl estradiol (EE) and the progestin norelgestromin increases the risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE) compared to previously marketed oral contraceptives (OCs). Quantitative information was obtained on the risk of nonfatal VTE in women using the contraceptive patch in comparison to women using OCs, norgestimate (either monophasic or triphasic) and 35 microg EE (norgestimate-35), an OC that has been marketed for over a decade. Nested case-control design based on information from PharMetrics, a US-based company that collects and organizes information on claims paid by managed care plans. The study was nested among all women aged 15 to 44, who started either the contraceptive patch or norgestimate-35 after April 1, 2002. Cases were women with current use of one of these two study drugs and a documented diagnosis of VTE in the absence of identifiable clinical risk factors (idiopathic VTE). Up to four controls were matched to each case by age and calendar time. Odds ratios (ORs) comparing the risk of nonfatal VTE in new users of the two contraceptives and incidence rates of nonfatal VTE for new users of each of the study contraceptives. We identified 68 newly diagnosed, idiopathic cases of VTE in the study population. In the case-control analysis, the OR comparing the contraceptive patch to norgestimate-35 was 0.9 (95% CI 0.5-1.6). The overall incidence rate for VTE was 52.8 per 100,000 women-years (95% CI 35.8-74.9) among users of the contraceptive patch and 41.8 per 100,000 women-years among users of norgestimate-35 (95% CI 29.4-57.6), and the age-adjusted VTE incidence rate ratio (IRR) for current use of the contraceptive patch vs. norgestimate-35 was 1.1 (95% CI 0.7-1.8). The risk of nonfatal VTE for the contraceptive patch is similar to the risk for OCs containing 35 microg ethinylestradiol and norgestimate.","The overall incidence of venous thromboembolism in this study was 52.8 per 100,000 women-years (95% confidence interval [CI], 35.8-74.9) among patch users and 41.8 per 100,000 women-years among oral contraceptive users (95% CI, 29.4-57.6). The study concluded that the risk of nonfatal venous thromboembolism for the patch is not higher than the risk for an oral contraceptive containing 35 µg EE and norgestimate (odds ratio [OR]=0.9; 95% CI, 0.5-1.6; incidence rate ratio [IRR]=1.1; 95% CI, 0.7-1.8)."
"Are steroid injections effective for tenosynovitis of the hand
In a controlled, prospective, double-blind study, the incidence of accurate injection of the abductor pollicis longus (APL) and extensor pollicis brevis (EPB) tendon compartments was defined and correlated with clinical relief of de Quervain's tendinitis. X-ray dye was included with steroid and lidocaine injections for 19 patients; dye location was immediately checked by 1 radiologist blinded to the clinical results. Dye was confirmed to be within the first dorsal compartment in 16 of 19 cases. There was relief of symptoms in 11 of 19 patients. Four of 5 patients with dye in both the APL and EPB tendon compartments, experienced relief of symptoms, while all 3 with dye in neither compartment experienced no relief. This suggests that accurate injection of steroids is required for relief of de Quervain's tendinitis. The EPB compartment was often missed (13/19 cases), possibly because it was separate or of small size and deep location. This may be a factor in failed injections, just as surgery can fail if a separate EPB compartment is not released.","In 1 small, controlled, prospective, double-blinded study, the authors attempted to correlate clinical relief of de Quervain's tenosynovitis with accuracy of injection into the first dorsal compartment. The researchers enrolled 19 patients. The same hand surgeon injected 3 cc of 1% lidocaine, 1 cc betamethasone, and 1 cc Omnipaque 300 dye into the abductor pollicis longus sheath and then attempted, with ulnar deviation of the needle, to fill the extensor pollicis brevis sheath. Patients were followed-up at 1 month and 3 months postinjection. Success-defined as a negative Finkelstein's test, absence of pain, and normal activities of daily living-was noted in 11 of 19 patients at 3 months. In a radiographic check, 4 of 5 of the patients with dye in both compartments were asymptomatic, while the 3 who had no dye in either compartment remained symptomatic. This suggests that the location of injection may be important in de Quervain's tenosynovitis."
"Does routine amniotomy have a role in normal labor
Intentional artificial rupture of the amniotic membranes during labour, sometimes called amniotomy or 'breaking of the waters', is one of the most commonly performed procedures in modern obstetric and midwifery practice. The primary aim of amniotomy is to speed up contractions and, therefore, shorten the length of labour. However, there are concerns regarding unintended adverse effects on the woman and baby. To determine the effectiveness and safety of amniotomy alone for (1) routinely shortening all labours that start spontaneously, and (2) shortening labours that have started spontaneously, but have become prolonged. We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 March 2007). Randomised controlled trials comparing amniotomy alone versus intention to preserve the membranes. We excluded quasi-randomised trials. Two authors assessed identified studies for inclusion. Both authors extracted data. Primary analysis was by intention to treat. We have included 14 studies in this review, involving 4893 women. There was no evidence of any statistical difference in length of first stage of labour (weighted mean difference -20.43 minutes, 95% confidence interval (CI) -95.93 to 55.06), maternal satisfaction with childbirth experience (standardised mean difference 0.27, 95% CI -0.49 to 1.04) or low Apgar score less than seven at five minutes (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.05). Amniotomy was associated with an increased risk of delivery by caesarean section compared to women in the control group, although the difference was not statistically significant (RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.62). There was no consistency between papers regarding the timing of amniotomy during labour in terms of cervical dilatation. On the basis of the findings of this review, we cannot recommend that amniotomy should be introduced routinely as part of standard labour management and care. We do recommend that the evidence presented in this review should be made available to women offered an amniotomy and may be useful as a foundation for discussion and any resulting decisions made between women and their caregivers.","No significant differences between the amniotomy and intact groups were noted in less uniformly reported maternal outcomes, including need for oxytocin to augment labor, rate of infection, serious morbidity, or death. Likewise, differences in neonatal outcomes-such as sepsis, respiratory failure, admission to the special care unit, and death-weren't statistically significant. Notably, however, these secondary outcomes occurred too rarely to measure the effect precisely."
"What is the best regimen for newly diagnosed hypertension
The Valsartan Antihypertensive Long-term Use Evaluation (VALUE) trial was designed to test the hypothesis that for the same blood-pressure control, valsartan would reduce cardiac morbidity and mortality more than amlodipine in hypertensive patients at high cardiovascular risk. 15?245 patients, aged 50 years or older with treated or untreated hypertension and high risk of cardiac events participated in a randomised, double-blind, parallel-group comparison of therapy based on valsartan or amlodipine. Duration of treatment was event-driven and the trial lasted until at least 1450 patients had reached a primary endpoint, defined as a composite of cardiac mortality and morbidity. Patients from 31 countries were followed up for a mean of 4.2 years. Blood pressure was reduced by both treatments, but the effects of the amlodipine-based regimen were more pronounced, especially in the early period (blood pressure 4.0/2.1 mm Hg lower in amlodipine than valsartan group after 1 month; 1.5/1.3 mm Hg after 1 year; p<0.001 between groups). The primary composite endpoint occurred in 810 patients in the valsartan group (10.6%, 25.5 per 1000 patient-years) and 789 in the amlodipine group (10.4%, 24.7 per 1000 patient-years; hazard ratio 1.04, 95% CI 0.94-1.15, p=0.49). The main outcome of cardiac disease did not differ between the treatment groups. Unequal reductions in blood pressure might account for differences between the groups in cause-specific outcomes. The findings emphasise the importance of prompt blood-pressure control in hypertensive patients at high cardiovascular risk.","A long-term trial has compared valsartan vs amlodipine in the Valsartan Antihypertensive Long-term Use Evaluation VALUE trial. In the VALUE trial, the primary endpoint of time to cardiac event was not different between valsartan and amlodipine (25.5 vs 24.7 events per 1000 patient-years, valsartan and amlodipine, respectively; P=.49)."
"What is the best strategy for impaired glucose tolerance in nonpregnant adults
The worldwide increase in type 2 diabetes mellitus is becoming a major health concern. We aimed to assess the effect of acarbose in preventing or delaying conversion of impaired glucose tolerance to type 2 diabetes. In a multicentre, placebo-controlled randomised trial, we randomly allocated patients with impaired glucose tolerance to 100 mg acarbose or placebo three times daily. The primary endpoint was development of diabetes on the basis of a yearly oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Analyses were by intention to treat. We randomly allocated 714 patients with impaired glucose tolerance to acarbose and 715 to placebo. We excluded 61 (4%) patients because they did not have impaired glucose tolerance or had no postrandomisation data. 211 (31%) of 682 patients in the acarbose group and 130 (19%) of 686 on placebo discontinued treatment early. 221 (32%) patients randomised to acarbose and 285 (42%) randomised to placebo developed diabetes (relative hazard 0.75 [95% CI 0.63-0.90]; p=0.0015). Furthermore, acarbose significantly increased reversion of impaired glucose tolerance to normal glucose tolerance (p<0.0001). At the end of the study, treatment with placebo for 3 months was associated with an increase in conversion of impaired glucose tolerance to diabetes. The most frequent side-effects to acarbose treatment were flatulence and diarrhoea. Acarbose could be used, either as an alternative or in addition to changes in lifestyle, to delay development of type 2 diabetes in patients with impaired glucose tolerance.","In the STOP-NIDDM trial of 1429 persons over 3.3 years of follow-up, acarbose 100 mg 3 times daily resulted in a 9% reduction of progression to diabetes, compared with placebo (NNT=11)"

The management of abnormal cervical cytology in adolescents differs from that for the adult population in many cases. Certain characteristics of adolescents may warrant special management considerations. It is important to avoid aggressive management of benign lesions in adolescents because most cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grades 1 and 2 regress. Surgical excision or destruction of cervical tissue in a nulliparous adolescent may be detrimental to future fertility and cervical competency. Care should be given to minimize destruction of normal cervical tissue whenever possible.

"What is the role of combination therapy insulin plus oral medication in type 2 diabetes
To compare the abilities and associated hypoglycemia risks of insulin glargine and human NPH insulin added to oral therapy of type 2 diabetes to achieve 7% HbA(1c). In a randomized, open-label, parallel, 24-week multicenter trial, 756 overweight men and women with inadequate glycemic control (HbA(1c) >7.5%) on one or two oral agents continued prestudy oral agents and received bedtime glargine or NPH once daily, titrated using a simple algorithm seeking a target fasting plasma glucose (FPG) <or=100 mg/dl (5.5 mmol/l). Outcome measures were FPG, HbA(1c), hypoglycemia, and percentage of patients reaching HbA(1c) <or=7% without documented nocturnal hypoglycemia. Mean FPG at end point was similar with glargine and NPH (117 vs. 120 mg/dl [6.5 vs. 6.7 mmol/l]), as was HbA(1c) (6.96 vs. 6.97%). A majority of patients ( approximately 60%) attained HbA(1c) <or=7% with each insulin type. However, nearly 25% more patients attained this without documented nocturnal hypoglycemia (<or=72 mg/dl [4.0 mmol/l]) with glargine (33.2 vs. 26.7%, P < 0.05). Moreover, rates of other categories of symptomatic hypoglycemia were 21-48% lower with glargine. Systematically titrating bedtime basal insulin added to oral therapy can safely achieve 7% HbA(1c) in a majority of overweight patients with type 2 diabetes with HbA(1c) between 7.5 and 10.0% on oral agents alone. In doing this, glargine causes significantly less nocturnal hypoglycemia than NPH, thus reducing a leading barrier to initiating insulin. This simple regimen may facilitate earlier and effective insulin use in routine medical practice, improving achievement of recommended standards of diabetes care.","An open-label randomized controlled trials of 756 patients with inadequate glycemic control (HbA1c >7.5%, mean 8.6%) on either 1 or 2 oral agents (70% taking both metformin and a sulfonylurea) compared combination therapy using bedtime insulin glargine with combination therapy using morning NPH. Each group titrated insulin doses to achieve a target fasting glucose ≤100. By 24 weeks, both groups had equivalently reduced HbA1c (mean HbA1c=6.96% with glargine, and 6.97% with NPH; P=NS), but fewer patients experienced nocturnal hypoglycemia with glargine than with NPH (33.2% vs 26.7%, P<.05)."

"Which interventions are best for alleviating nipple pain in nursing mothers
To review the literature on nipple pain and to delineate effective strategies for the prevention and treatment of nipple pain in breastfeeding mothers. Computerized searches on MEDLINE, Pre-MEDLINE, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library. Articles from indexed journals relevant to the objective were reviewed from January 1983 to April 2004. Preference was given to research-based studies in English. Data were extracted and organized under two headings: prevention of nipple pain or trauma and treatment of nipple pain or trauma. The Critical Appraisal Form by J. Briggs was used to extract the data from research-based articles. The health benefits of breastfeeding for mother and infant are well documented; however, nipple pain is a common reason reported by women for the early termination of breastfeeding. Several studies have compared various treatments for either the prevention of or treatment for nipple pain. These treatments include warm water compresses, tea bag compresses, heat, application of expressed mother's milk, lanolin, vitamin A, collagenase, dexpanthenol, hydrogel therapy, glycerin gel therapy, moist occlusive dressing, education regarding proper latch-on and positioning, and no treatment. No one topical agent showed superior results in the relief of nipple discomfort. The most important factor in decreasing the incidence of nipple pain is the provision of education in relation to proper breastfeeding technique and latch-on as well as anticipatory guidance regarding the high incidence of early postpartum nipple pain.","Two studies of educational sessions, 1 antenatal (N=75) and 1 immediately postnatal (N=160), reported less nipple pain in the intervention groups (number needed to treat [NNT]=1.6 and 5.6, respectively). The antenatal education study demonstrated higher continuation of breastfeeding at 6 weeks postpartum in the intervention group (NNT=4.5), whereas the postnatal study showed no significant difference in continuation of breastfeeding in the intervention group at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months."

There was no evidence of any statistical difference in length of first stage of labour (weighted mean difference -20.43 minutes, 95% confidence interval (CI) -95.93 to 55.06), maternal satisfaction with childbirth experience (standardised mean difference 0.27, 95% CI -0.49 to 1.04) or low Apgar score less than seven at five minutes (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.05). Amniotomy was associated with an increased risk of delivery by caesarean section compared to women in the control group, although the difference was not statistically significant (RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.62). There was no consistency between papers regarding the timing of amniotomy during labour in terms of cervical dilatation. On the basis of the findings of this review, we cannot recommend that amniotomy should be introduced routinely as part of standard labour management and care. We do recommend that the evidence presented in this review should be made available to women offered an amniotomy and may be useful as a foundation for discussion and any resulting decisions made between women and their caregivers.","A Cochrane review of 14 trials (4893 women) investigated the risks and benefits of routine amniotomy vs intention to leave membranes intact. All trials included only very-low-risk women in spontaneous labor at term with a singleton fetus in vertex presentation. Five of the trials (1127 women) reported length of first-stage labor. No statistically significant difference was found between amniotomy and control groups (weighted mean difference [WMD]=-20.43 minutes; 95% confidence interval [CI], -95.93 to 55.06). Furthermore, subgroup analysis found no statistically significant reduction in length of first-stage labor for nulliparous (WMD=-57.93 min; 95% CI, -152.66 to 36.80) or multiparous women (WMD= 23.10 min; 95% CI, -50.89 to 97.09)."
"What are the causes of elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone in a newborn
The purpose of this study was to relate severity of illness at 1, 7, 14, and 28 postnatal days in preterm infants groups, 23-27 (n = 73), 28-30 (n = 160), and 31-34 (n = 208) wk gestation, to the corresponding sera levels of T(4), free T(4), T(4)-binding globulin, TSH, T(3), rT(3), and T(4) sulfate. The British Association of Perinatal Medicine and Neonatal Nurses Association 1992 scoring categories (published elsewhere) were used as an index of illness severity: level 1 (maximal intensive care) was compared with level 2 (high-dependency intensive care) combined with level 3 (special care); infants were scored on 1, 7, 14, and 28 postnatal days. In level 1 infants, there were significant reductions in T(3) at 7 d (28-30 wk), 14, and 28 d (23-27 and 28-30 wk); T(4) at 7, 14, and 28 d (23-27 wk); at 14 and 28 d (28-30 wk); and at 7 d (31-34 wk); and free T(4) at 14 d (23-27 wk). TSH was unchanged in all groups at all ages and with reductions in T(4) and T(3) being the key features of severe illness in extreme preterm infants.","Another study confirmed that thyroid-stimulating hormone levels were higher in infants born preterm; babies with the earliest gestational ages had the highest thyroid-stimulating hormone levels. The same study also found that thyroid-stimulating hormone levels increased with increasing degrees of illness. Very preterm babies, those with cerebral pathology, low Apgar scores, respiratory distress syndrome, persistent ductus arteriosus requiring treatment, and necrotizing enterocolitis were at highest risk for having abnormally elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone levels in this study. If a sample is drawn from a newborn exhibiting symptoms (such as poor feeding or hypotonia), the thyroid-stimulating hormone level may be elevated in spite of normal thyroid function."
"What interventions reduce the risk of contrast nephropathy for high-risk patients
This study was designed to test a rapid protocol of intravenous acetylcysteine for prevention of radiocontrast-induced nephropathy (RCIN). Oral acetylcysteine (NAC) may provide better prophylaxis against RCIN than intravenous (i.v.) hydration alone. Current protocols preclude prophylaxis of same-day or emergency patients owing to the need for prolonged pretreatment. We prospectively randomized 80 patients with stable renal dysfunction undergoing cardiac catheterization/intervention to a rapid protocol of i.v. NAC (150 mg/kg in 500 ml N/saline over 30 min immediately before contrast followed by 50 mg/kg in 500 ml N/saline over 4 h, n = 41, 67 +/- 10 years, 90% men) or i.v. hydration (1 ml/kg/h N/saline for 12 h pre- and post-contrast, n = 39, 71 +/- 8.8 years, 85% men). Radiocontrast-induced nephropathy occurred in 2 of the 41 patients in the NAC group (5%) and in 8 of the 39 patients in the hydration group (21%; p = 0.045; relative risk: 0.28; 95% confidence interval 0.08 to 0.98). In the NAC group, mean serum creatinine fell from 1.85 +/- 0.59 to 1.77 +/- 0.73 and 1.79 +/- 0.73 mg/dl 48 h and four days post-contrast (p = 0.02 and 0.023 vs. baseline, respectively). In the hydration group, serum creatinine increased from 1.75 +/- 0.41 to 1.81 +/- 0.6 48 h and 1.80 +/- 0.50 mg/dl four days post-contrast (p = 0.99 and 0.23, respectively). NAC infusion was ceased after the bolus in three patients (7%) due to flushing, itching, or a transient rash. Administration of i.v. NAC should be considered in all patients at risk of RCIN before contrast exposure when time constraints preclude adequate oral prophylaxis, provided the patient is able to tolerate this degree of volume loading.",Preliminary evidence shows that intravenous administration of acetylcysteine immediately before contrast administration lowers the risk of contrast nephropathy. Oral acetylcysteine is low in cost and has no known side effects.
"What are safe sleeping arrangements for infants
After striking changes in rates of sudden unexplained infant death (SIDS) around 1990, four large case-control studies were set up to re-examine the epidemiology of this syndrome. The European Concerted Action on SIDS (ECAS) investigation was planned to bring together data from these and new studies to give an overview of risk factors for the syndrome in Europe. We undertook case-control studies in 20 regions. Data for more than 60 variables were extracted from anonymised records of 745 SIDS cases and 2411 live controls. Logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) for every factor in isolation, and to construct multivariate models. Principal risk factors were largely independent. Multivariately significant ORs showed little evidence of intercentre heterogeneity apart from four outliers, which were eliminated. Highly significant risks were associated with prone sleeping (OR 13.1 [95% CI 8.51-20.2]) and with turning from the side to the prone position (45.4 [23.4-87.9]). About 48% of cases were attributable to sleeping in the side or prone position. If the mother smoked, significant risks were associated with bed-sharing, especially during the first weeks of life (at 2 weeks 27.0 [13.3-54.9]). This OR was partly attributable to mother's consumption of alcohol. Mother's alcohol consumption was significant only when baby bed-shared all night (OR increased by 1.66 [1.16-2.38] per drink). For mothers who did not smoke during pregnancy, OR for bed-sharing was very small (at 2 weeks 2.4 [1.2-4.6]) and only significant during the first 8 weeks of life. About 16% of cases were attributable to bed-sharing and roughly 36% to the baby sleeping in a separate room. Avoidable risk factors such as those associated with inappropriate infants' sleeping position, type of bedding used, and sleeping arrangements strongly suggest a basis for further substantial reductions in SIDS incidence rates.",A study found a 10-fold increased risk.
"When should travelers begin malaria prophylaxis
The spread of chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium falciparum malaria has led to increased use of mefloquine prophylaxis by US Peace Corps volunteers in sub-Saharan Africa. We compared long-term mefloquine with other drug regimens for effectiveness and tolerance. The incidence of Plasmodium falciparum infections and of adverse reactions was compared in Peace Corps volunteers who took chloroquine weekly, mefloquine weekly, mefloquine every other week, or weekly chloroquine plus daily proguanil. Weekly mefloquine was 94% more effective than chloroquine (95% CI 86% to 97%), 86% more effective than chloroquine plus proguanil (95% CI 67% to 94%), and 82% more effective than prophylaxis with mefloquine when taken every other week (95% CI 68% to 90%). No serious adverse reactions were observed. Mild adverse events were equally frequent in mefloquine users and chloroquine users, and the frequency of these events declined with increasing duration of prophylaxis. Mefloquine is an effective and well-tolerated drug for prophylaxis of malaria by short-term and long-term travellers.",A study of the long-term use of mefloquine in 421 healthy Peace Corps volunteers has shown it to be safe.
"What are the best prophylactic drugs for migraine
We used meta-analytic statistical techniques to synthesize findings from studies that evaluated propranolol HCI for the prevention of recurrent migraine (2,403 treated patients). The modal migraine sufferer treated in these studies was a female, about 37 years of age, who suffered from common (rather than classical) migraines and reported a 17-year history of problem migraines. The modal treatment was 160 mg. propranolol per day. Meta-analysis revealed that, on average, propranolol yielded a 44% reduction in migraine activity when daily headache recordings were used to assess treatment outcome, and a 65% reduction in migraine activity when less conservative measures (e.g., clinical ratings of improvement, global patient reports) were used. Meta-analysis thus revealed substantial support for short-term effectiveness of propranolol. However, little information was available concerning the long-term effectiveness of propranolol.","In a meta-analysis, propranolol resulted in a 44% reduction in the headache index-a composite score that takes into account both intensity and duration-compared with a 14% reduction for placebo."
"What evaluation is best for an isolated, enlarged cervical lymph node
Lymphadenopathy is common, affecting patients of all ages. The current referral pattern for investigating patients with lymphadenopathy varies widely with no universally practised pathway. Our institution set up a lymph node diagnostic clinic (LNDC) accepting direct referrals from primary care physicians. Details of clinical presentation and investigations were recorded prospectively. Between December 1996 and July 2001, 550 patients were referred (M: 203; F:347). The median age was 40 years (range 14-90). The median time between initial referral and the first clinic visit was 6 days. Of 95 patients diagnosed to have malignant diseases, the median time from the first clinic visit to reaching malignant diagnosis was 15 days. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified five significant predictors for malignant nodes: male gender (risk ratio (RR)=2.72; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.63-4.56), increasing age (RR=1.05; 95% CI: 1.04-1.07), white ethnicity (RR=3.01; 95% CI: 1.19-7.6) and sites of lymph nodes: supraclavicular region (RR=3.72; 95% CI: 1.52-9.12) and > or = 2 regions of lymph nodes (RR=6.41; 95% CI: 2.82-14.58). Ultrasound and fine-needle aspiration cytology of palpable lymph nodes were performed in 154 and 289 patients, respectively. An accuracy of 97 and 84% was found, respectively. In conclusion, a multidisciplinary lymph node diagnostic clinic enables a rapid, concerted approach to a common medical problem and patients with malignant diseases were diagnosed in a timely fashion.","Histologic evaluation after excisional biopsy is the gold standard for diagnosis. Fine-needle aspiration is an alternate, minimally invasive option for further work-up. Fine-needle aspiration had a sensitivity of 49% and specificity of 97% in a study of 550 patients."
"How do you evaluate macrocytosis without anemia
Macrocytosis is considered to be an important sign of disease, although it often seems to be ignored. The aim of the present study was to assess the quality of the work done by general practitioners using macrocytosis as an indicator. All consecutive outpatients at Tampere City Health Center who had blood counts taken during 8 months in 1990 and were found to have macrocytosis (MCV > or = 100 femtoliters) that had not earlier been examined, were included in this study. The further examinations undertaken were analyzed. Of the 9,527 blood counts, previously unexamined macrocytosis was found in 3% (n = 287, 154 men and 133 women). Further examination because of macrocytosis was undertaken in 65 (42%) men and in 48 (36%) women. Alcohol abuse was the most common disease present in 52 (80%) men and in 22 (46%) women. No cause for macrocytosis was found in seven men and in 17 women. No difference between the examined and unexamined groups was found concerning medical history, medications, symptoms, or blood count values, including hemoglobin and MCV. Evaluation of macrocytosis, when undertaken, was well done by general practitioners. However, it was performed too seldom and, thus, several diseases, especially alcohol abuse, may have been overlooked.",A retrospective chart review of 113 cases of macrocytosis in outpatients found that general practitioners often did not order a peripheral smear and reticulocyte count to complete their diagnostic workups.
"What is the evaluation and treatment strategy for Raynaud's phenomenon
It was expected that stress and anxiety would be related to Raynaud's phenomenon (RP) attack characteristics when mild outdoor temperatures produced partial or no digital vasoconstriction. Hypotheses were that in warmer temperature categories, compared to those below 40 degrees F, higher stress or anxiety would be associated with more frequent, severe, and painful attacks. The Raynaud's Treatment Study recruited 313 participants with primary RP. Outcomes were attack rate, severity, and pain. Predictors were average daily outdoor temperature, stress, anxiety, age, gender, and a stress-by-temperature or an anxiety-by-temperature interaction. Outcomes were tested separately in multiple linear regression models. Stress and anxiety were tested in separate models. Stress was not a significant predictor of RP attack characteristics. Higher anxiety was related to more frequent attacks above 60 degrees F. It was also related to greater attack severity at all temperatures, and to greater pain above 60 degrees F and between 40 degrees and 49.9 degrees F.","Conservative management is helpful for all patients with Raynaud's phenomenon, and may be the only treatment needed. Experts advise dressing warmly, wearing gloves when appropriate, using abortive strategies such as placing the hands into warm water, and avoiding sudden cold exposure, emotional stress, and vasoconstrictive agents such as nicotine."
"Which postmenopausal women should be offered combined hormone replacement therapy
Despite decades of accumulated observational evidence, the balance of risks and benefits for hormone use in healthy postmenopausal women remains uncertain. To assess the major health benefits and risks of the most commonly used combined hormone preparation in the United States. Estrogen plus progestin component of the Women's Health Initiative, a randomized controlled primary prevention trial (planned duration, 8.5 years) in which 16608 postmenopausal women aged 50-79 years with an intact uterus at baseline were recruited by 40 US clinical centers in 1993-1998. Participants received conjugated equine estrogens, 0.625 mg/d, plus medroxyprogesterone acetate, 2.5 mg/d, in 1 tablet (n = 8506) or placebo (n = 8102). The primary outcome was coronary heart disease (CHD) (nonfatal myocardial infarction and CHD death), with invasive breast cancer as the primary adverse outcome. A global index summarizing the balance of risks and benefits included the 2 primary outcomes plus stroke, pulmonary embolism (PE), endometrial cancer, colorectal cancer, hip fracture, and death due to other causes. On May 31, 2002, after a mean of 5.2 years of follow-up, the data and safety monitoring board recommended stopping the trial of estrogen plus progestin vs placebo because the test statistic for invasive breast cancer exceeded the stopping boundary for this adverse effect and the global index statistic supported risks exceeding benefits. This report includes data on the major clinical outcomes through April 30, 2002. Estimated hazard ratios (HRs) (nominal 95% confidence intervals [CIs]) were as follows: CHD, 1.29 (1.02-1.63) with 286 cases; breast cancer, 1.26 (1.00-1.59) with 290 cases; stroke, 1.41 (1.07-1.85) with 212 cases; PE, 2.13 (1.39-3.25) with 101 cases; colorectal cancer, 0.63 (0.43-0.92) with 112 cases; endometrial cancer, 0.83 (0.47-1.47) with 47 cases; hip fracture, 0.66 (0.45-0.98) with 106 cases; and death due to other causes, 0.92 (0.74-1.14) with 331 cases. Corresponding HRs (nominal 95% CIs) for composite outcomes were 1.22 (1.09-1.36) for total cardiovascular disease (arterial and venous disease), 1.03 (0.90-1.17) for total cancer, 0.76 (0.69-0.85) for combined fractures, 0.98 (0.82-1.18) for total mortality, and 1.15 (1.03-1.28) for the global index. Absolute excess risks per 10 000 person-years attributable to estrogen plus progestin were 7 more CHD events, 8 more strokes, 8 more PEs, and 8 more invasive breast cancers, while absolute risk reductions per 10 000 person-years were 6 fewer colorectal cancers and 5 fewer hip fractures. The absolute excess risk of events included in the global index was 19 per 10 000 person-years. Overall health risks exceeded benefits from use of combined estrogen plus progestin for an average 5.2-year follow-up among healthy postmenopausal US women. All-cause mortality was not affected during the trial. The risk-benefit profile found in this trial is not consistent with the requirements for a viable intervention for primary prevention of chronic diseases, and the results indicate that this regimen should not be initiated or continued for primary prevention of CHD.","The Women's Health Initiative (WHI), the largest randomized trial of HRT, showed that long-term use of hormone replacement therapy poses more risks than benefits for healthy postmenopausal women. women's health initiative studied the use of estrogen plus progestin for prevention of coronary heart disease in 16,608 postmenopausal women age 50-79 years. After 5 years of follow-up, this arm of the study was stopped because of the adverse effects of the intervention. The researchers found that hormone replacement therapy increases the risk of several events: 1) coronary heart disease events (number needed to harm [NNH]=1428); 2) invasive breast cancer (NNH=1250); 3) stroke (NNH=1250); 4) venous thromboembolic events (NNH=555); 5) pulmonary embolism (NNH=1250)."
"What is the initial approach to the treatment of shoulder pain
To compare the efficacy of physiotherapy, manipulation, and corticosteroid injection for treating patients with shoulder complaints in general practice. Randomised, single blind study. Seven general practices in the Netherlands. 198 patients with shoulder complaints, of whom 172 were divided, on the basis of physical examination, into two diagnostic groups: a shoulder girdle group (n = 58) and a synovial group (n = 114). Patients in the shoulder girdle group were randomised to manipulation or physiotherapy, and patients in the synovial group were randomised to corticosteroid injection, manipulation, or physiotherapy. Duration of shoulder complaints analysed by survival analysis. In the shoulder girdle group duration of complaints was significantly shorter after manipulation compared with physiotherapy (P < 0.001). Also the number of patients reporting treatment failure was less with manipulation. In the synovial group duration of complaints was shortest after corticosteroid injection compared with manipulation and physiotherapy (P < 0.001). Drop out due to treatment failure was low in the injection group (17%) and high in the manipulation group (59%) and physiotherapy group (51%). For treating shoulder girdle disorders, manipulation seems to be the preferred treatment. For the synovial disorders, corticosteroid injection seems the best treatment.","A randomized single-blind study of primary care patients reported superiority of manipulative therapy over classic physiotherapy in the treatment of shoulder pain (70% vs 10% cure rate at 5 weeks). Manipulative therapy as performed by general practitioners or physiotherapists included mobilization and manipulation of the upper spine and ribs, acromioclavicular joint, and the glenohumeral joint. Classic physiotherapy as performed by physiotherapists included only exercise therapy, massage, and physical applications. For the patients with synovial pain, intra-articular corticosteroid injection was superior to both manipulative therapy and classic physiotherapy (cure rates of 75% vs 40% and 20%, respectively, at 5 weeks), yet many primary care physicians may not have enough experience to specifically diagnose synovial pain."
"Does furosemide decrease morbidity or mortality for patients with diastolic or systolic dysfunction
In patients with chronic heart failure (CHF), diuretic requirements increase as the disease progresses. Because diuretic resistance can be overcome with escalating doses, the evaluation of CHF severity and prognosis may be incomplete without considering the intensity of therapy. The prognostic importance of diuretic resistance (as evidenced by a high-dose requirement) was retrospectively evaluated in 1153 patients with advanced CHF who were enrolled in the Prospective Randomized Amlodipine Survival Evaluation (PRAISE). The relation of loop diuretic and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor doses (defined by their median values) and other baseline characteristics to total and cause-specific mortality was determined by proportion hazards regression. High diuretic doses were independently associated with mortality, sudden death, and pump failure death (adjusted hazard ratios [HRs] 1.37 [P =.004], 1.39 [P =.042], and 1.51 [P =.034], respectively). Use of metolazone was an independent predictor of total mortality (adjusted HR = 1.37, P =.016) but not of cause-specific mortality. Low angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor dose was an independent predictor of pump failure death (adjusted HR = 2.21, P =.0005). Unadjusted mortality risks of congestion and its treatment were additive and comparable to those of established risk factors. The independent association of high diuretic doses with mortality suggests that diuretic resistance should be considered an indicator of prognosis in patients with chronic CHF. These retrospective observations do not establish harm or rule out a long-term benefit of diuretics in CHF, because selection bias may entirely explain the relation of prescribed therapy to death.","A retrospective study of 1153 patients with new york heart association Class III to IV heart failure, who were enrolled in the Prospective Randomized Amlodipine Survival Evaluation (PRAISE), found high diuretic doses to be independently associated with mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [HR]=1.37; P=.004), sudden death (HR=1.39; P=.042), and pump failure death (HR=1.51; P=.034)."
"What is the best way to evaluate and manage diarrhea in the febrile infant
This review was designed to assess the evidence from randomized controlled trials on effects of probiotics in the treatment and prevention of acute infectious diarrhea in infants and children. A systematic review of published, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials on probiotics in the treatment or prevention of acute diarrhea defined as >3 loose or watery stools per 24 hours in infants and children. The use of probiotics as compared with placebo was associated with a significantly reduced risk of diarrhea lasting >3 days. The pooled estimate risk was 0.43 (95% CI, 0.34-0.53) with a fixed-effect model, and remained significant in a random-effect model (0.40; 95% CI, 0.28-0.57). Only Lactobacillus GG showed a consistent effect. Probiotics significantly reduced the duration of diarrhea when compared with placebo, particularly in rotaviral gastroenteritis-the pooled, weighted, mean difference (WMD) assuming the random-effect model was -20.1 hours (95% CI, -26.1 to -14.2) and -24.8 (95% CI, -31.8 to -17.9) respectively. A meta-analysis of the prevention studies was not feasible because of significant clinical and statistical heterogeneity. There is evidence of a clinically significant benefit of probiotics in the treatment of acute infectious diarrhea in infants and children, particularly in rotaviral gastroenteritis. Lactobacillus GG showed the most consistent effect, although other probiotic strains may also be effective. Further research is needed. Clinical and statistical heterogeneity of the prophylactic interventions preclude drawing firm conclusions about the efficacy of probiotics in preventing acute gastroenteritis.","An randomized controlled trials showed that Lactobacillus supplementation shortened the duration of diarrhea for infants and young children. Lactobacillus supplementation reduced the risk of diarrhea persisting more than 3 days (relative risk [RR]=0.43; 95% CI, 0.34-0.53; P<.001; number needed to treat [NNT]=4)."
"Should we screen women for hypothyroidism
Osteoporosis is the main cause of spine and hip fractures. Morbidity, mortality, and costs arising from hip fractures have been well documented. Thyroid hormones (TH) are widely prescribed, mainly in the elderly. Some studies (but not all) found a deleterious effect of suppressive TH therapy on bone mass. These conflicting data raised a controversy as to the safety of current prescribing and follow-up habits, which, in turn, raised major health-care issues. To look for a detrimental effect on bone of TH therapy, we performed a meta-analysis (by pooling standardized differences, using a fixed effect model) of all published controlled cross-sectional studies (41, including about 1250 patients) concerning the impact of TH therapy on bone mineral density (BMD). Studies with women receiving estrogen therapy were excluded a priori, as were studies with a high percentage of patients with postoperative hypoparathyroidism, when no separate data were available. We decided to stratify the data according to anatomical site, menopausal status, and suppressive or replacement TH therapy, resulting in 25 meta-analysis on 138 homogeneous subsets of data. The main sources of heterogensity between studies that we could identify were replacement or suppressive TH therapy, menopausal status, site (lumbar spine, femoral neck, Ward's triangle, greater trochanter, midshaft and distal radius, with various percentages of cortical bone), and history of hyperthyroidism, which has recently been found to impair bone mass in a large epidemiological survey. To improve homogeneity, we excluded a posteriori 102 patients from 3 studies, who had a past history of hyperthyroidism and separate BMD data, thus allowing assessment of the TH effect in almost all 25 subset meta-analyses. However, controls were usually not matched with cases for many factors influencing bone mass, such as body weight, age at menarche and at menopause, calcium dietary intake, smoking habits, alcohol intake, exercise, etc. For lumbar spine and hip (as for all other sites), suppressive TH therapy was associated with significant bone loss in postmenopausal women (but not in premenopausal women), whereas, conversely, replacement therapy was associated with bone loss in premenopausal women (spine and hip), but not in postmenopausal women. The detrimental effect of TH appeared more marked on cortical bone than on trabecular bone. Only a large long term prospective placebo-controlled trial of TH therapy (e.g. in benign nodules) evaluating BMD (and ideally fracture rate) would provide further insight into these issues.","A meta-analysis of 41 controlled, cross-sectional studies involving 1250 women treated with thyroid replacement for all causes (ie, not specifically subclinical hypothyroidism) found that replacement therapy (mean duration of treatment, 7 to 9 years) was associated with bone loss in premenopausal women, but not in postmenopausal women."
"Should patients with acute deep venous thrombosis limit activity
The aim of prescribing strict bed rest for acute deep venous thrombosis is to reduce the risk of pulmonary embolism and pain in the legs, as well as swelling. This study was performed in order to compare outcome of mobilization against 5 days of strict bed rest in patients with acute proximal deep venous thrombosis (DVT). 103 in-patients with proximal DVT or patients admitted to the hospital because of proximal DVT were recruited to a randomized study. All patients were treated in hospital and given a lower leg and thigh compression bandage as well as therapeutic doses of the low molecular weight heparin, dalteparin-sodium (Fragmin). Seven of 52 patients (13.5%) in the mobile group versus 14 of 50 patients (28.0%) in the immobile group suffered at least one of the outcomes defined under the combined primary endpoint (clinically relevant pulmonary embolisms, pulmonary embolisms detectable by scintigraphy or computer tomography, progression of thrombosis or new thrombosis, nosocomial infections and/or serious adverse events) (p = 0.088), whereby serious adverse events occurred once in the mobile group and three times in the immobile group. New pulmonary embolisms over the course were seen in 10 of 50 patients (20%) with a perfusion disorder at baseline scintigraphy, while such was ascertained only in one of 52 patients (1.9%) without a perfusion disorder at baseline scintigraphy. Leg pain was reduced from 54.1 (+/-30.4) to 20.7 (+/-19.2) in the mobilized group and from 41.0 (+/-26.8) to 14.0 (+/-11.1) in the immobilized patients. Leg pain was assessed using the visual analogue scale (0 = no pain, 100 = maximum pain). More immobilized patients complained of increasing back pain (23% versus 6%) and disturbed micturition (10% versus 2%) as well as defecation (13% versus 6%) on day 5. More patients in the mobile group reported increased stress from the thrombosis and its treatment (15% versus 6%). No benefit of prescribing bed rest in patients with deep venous thrombosis could be detected in this study. Based on data available, strict bed rest for at least 5 days is not justified if adequate therapy with low molecular weight heparin and adequate compression is assured. It remains open whether patients with initial signs of pulmonary embolism might profit from a brief immobilization.","An randomized controlled trials revealed a trend toward thrombus progression occurring more often in patients who were treated with bed rest compared with patients treated with ambulation and compression, though the difference did not reach statistical significance because of small sample size. The clinical importance of these phlebographic studies is not clear."
"What is the best surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma in chronic carriers of hepatitis B
Screening for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been conducted for over 20 years, but there is no conclusive evidence that screening may reduce HCC mortality. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of screening on HCC mortality in people at increased risk. This study included 18,816 people, aged 35-59 years with hepatitis B virus infection or a history of chronic hepatitis in urban Shanghai, China. Participants were randomly allocated to a screening (9,373) or control (9,443) group. Controls received no screening and continued to use health-care facilities. Screening group participants were invited to have an AFP test and ultrasonography examination every 6 months. Screening was stopped in December 1997; by that time screening group participants had been offered five to ten times. All participants were followed up until December 1998. The primary outcome measure was HCC mortality. The screened group completed 58.2 percent of the screening offered. When the screening group was compared to the control group, the number of HCC was 86 versus 67; subclinical HCC being 52 (60.5%) versus 0; small HCC 39 (45.3%) versus 0; resection achieved 40 (46.5%) versus 5 (7.5%); 1-, 3,-, and 5-year survival rate 65.9%, 52.6%, 46.4% versus 31.2%, 7.2%, 0, respectively. Thirty-two people died from HCC in the screened group versus 54 in the control group, and the HCC mortality rate was significantly lower in the screened group than in controls, being 83.2/100,000 and 131.5/100,000, respectively, with a mortality rate ratio of 0.63 (95%CI 0.41-0.98). Our finding indicated that biannual screening reduced HCC mortality by 37%.","Additional data became available in 2002. The original study authors of the Shanghai trial claimed the new data showed a statistically significant disease-specific mortality rate ratio of 0.63, favoring the screened group."
"Should we screen women for hypothyroidism
The relationship between subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) and an atherogenic lipoprotein profile is still controversial. We measured lipoproteins in 49 SCH patients by comparison with 33 euthyroid controls. Total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLc), apolipoprotein A(1), apolipoprotein B, and lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)] were measured after an overnight fast. Patients were randomly assigned to levothyroxine therapy or placebo and re-evaluated after 6 months of euthyroidism. SCH patients showed significantly higher TC (P < 0.01), LDLc (P = 0.01), and apolipoprotein B (P = 0.001) levels than controls, positively correlated with baseline TSH levels (P = 0.003, P = 0.01, and P = 0.03, respectively). Elevated Lp(a) levels were significantly more frequent in SCH (P < 0.05) and associated with familial diabetes mellitus and/or coronary heart disease (P < 0.01). Levothyroxine treatment resulted in a significant decrease of both TC and LDLc concentrations (P = 0.003), in direct proportion to the respective baseline values (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01, respectively), whereas no change in Lp(a) level was observed. No changes occurred in the placebo group. In conclusion, only serum LDLc levels are increased specifically and reversibly in association with SCH. Altered Lp(a) values reflect a genetic influence rather than a reduced thyroid hormone action.","A randomized trial involving 42 women with subclinical hypothyroidism measured lipid levels before and after 6 months of levothyroxine treatment. Levothyroxine reduced total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein significantly compared with placebo. Additionally, the subclinical hypothyroidism patients had higher baseline lipid levels when compared with 27 euthyroid controls."
"Is antibiotic prophylaxis effective for recurrent acute otitis media
Antibiotic resistance is increasing among the pathogens that commonly cause acute otitis media. This development may merit changes in the traditional antibiotic treatment of acute otitis media. Risk factors for resistant pathogens include recent antibiotic treatment of acute otitis media, children in day care facilities, wintertime infections and acute otitis media in children less than two years of age. Amoxicillin remains the antibiotic of first choice, although a higher dosage (80 mg per kg per day) may be indicated to ensure eradication of resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. Oral cefuroxime or amoxicillin-clavulanate and intramuscular ceftriaxone are suggested second-line choices for treatment failure. Compliance with antibiotic regimens is enhanced by selecting agents that require less frequent dosing (such as one or two times a day) and by prescribing shorter (five days or less) treatment courses. Selective use of tympanocentesis if the patient does not respond to empiric therapy can help confirm the diagnosis and guide effective therapy.","A review article states: ""Many children with acute otitis media do not benefit from antimicrobial therapy because the cause of their illness is not bacterial or the infection is cleared by the immune system without use of a drug. At present, we do not have clinical criteria for distinguishing which children are in need of antibiotic therapy for AOM.""."
"Does surgery for carpal tunnel syndrome improve outcomes
Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) can be treated with nonsurgical or surgical options. However, there is no consensus on the most effective method of treatment. To compare the short-term and long-term efficacy of splinting and surgery for relieving the symptoms of CTS. A randomized controlled trial conducted from October 1998 to April 2000 at 13 neurological outpatient clinics in the Netherlands. A total of 176 patients with clinically and electrophysiologically confirmed idiopathic CTS were assigned to wrist splinting during the night for at least 6 weeks (89 patients) or open carpal tunnel release (87 patients); 147 patients (84%) completed the final follow-up assessment 18 months after randomization. General improvement, number of nights waking up due to symptoms, and severity of symptoms. In the intention-to-treat analyses, surgery was more effective than splinting on all outcome measures. The success rates (based on general improvement) after 3 months were 80% for the surgery group (62/78 patients) vs 54% for the splinting group (46/86 patients), which is a difference of 26% (95% confidence interval [CI], 12%-40%; P<.001). After 18 months, the success rates increased to 90% for the surgery group (61/68 patients) vs 75% for the splinting group (59/79 patients), which is a difference of 15% (95% CI, 3%-27%; P =.02). However, by that time 41% of patients (32/79) in the splint group had also received the surgery treatment. Treatment with open carpal tunnel release surgery resulted in better outcomes than treatment with wrist splinting for patients with CTS.","A well-designed randomized controlled trials of 176 patients published since that Cochrane review stated that with regard to overall improvement of symptoms and function status, surgical treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome was more effective than wrist splinting 18 months posttreatment. The investigators found that surgery resulted in worse short-term outcomes at 1 month follow-up (29% vs 42% success), but by 3 months the improvement in all outcomes was greater in the surgery group (80% vs 54% success). The number needed to treat (NNT) over 18 months was only 2 patients in the treatment-received (per protocol) analysis (92% vs 37% success) and 7 in the intention-to-treat analysis (90% vs 75% success). Patients in the conservative treatment group who underwent surgery after splinting had failed had a higher success rate after 18 months follow-up than patients who did not have surgery (94% vs 62% success rate; number needed to treat = 3)."
"Is exercise treadmill testing useful for detecting heart disease in women
Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death among women and accounts for more than half of their deaths. Women have been underrepresented in most studies of cardiovascular disease. Reduced physical fitness has been shown to increase the risk of death in men. Exercise capacity measured by exercise stress test is an objective measure of physical fitness. The hypothesis that reduced exercise capacity is associated with an increased risk of death was investigated in a cohort of 5721 asymptomatic women who underwent baseline examinations in 1992. Information collected at baseline included medical and family history, demographic characteristics, physical examination, and symptom-limited stress ECG, using the Bruce protocol. Exercise capacity was measured in metabolic equivalents (MET). Nonfasting blood was analyzed at baseline. A National Death Index search was performed to identify all-cause death and date of death up to the end of 2000. The mean age of participants at baseline was 52+/-11 years. Framingham Risk Score-adjusted hazards ratios (with 95% CI) of death associated with MET levels of <5, 5 to 8, and >8 were 3.1 (2.0 to 4.7), 1.9 (1.3 to 2.9), and 1.00, respectively. The Framingham Risk Score-adjusted mortality risk decreased by 17% for every 1-MET increase. This is the largest cohort of asymptomatic women studied in this context over the longest period of follow-up. This study confirms that exercise capacity is an independent predictor of death in asymptomatic women, greater than what has been previously established among men. The implications for clinical practice and health care policy are far reaching.",A cohort study of 5721 women found that an exercise capacity of <5 metabolic equivalents (METS) tripled the risk of death as compared with those with an exercise capacity of >8 METS. These studies support the role of exercise treadmill testing for risk stratification for coronary artery disease disease in women.
"What is the recommended evaluation and treatment for elevated serum prolactin
Bromocriptine, a specific dopamine receptor agonist, has been used for the treatment of various hyperprolactinemic conditions and as adjunctive therapy for acromegaly (with or without concomitant hyperprolactinemia) and Parkinson's disease. Bromocriptine is extremely effective in suppressing prolactin secretion regardless of the cause, in restoring gonadal function and fertility, and in decreasing the size of prolactin-secreting pituitary tumors. Most patients with acromegaly have clinical improvement with this drug. When bromocriptine is added to a regimen of levodopa or carbidopa, patients with Parkinson's disease frequently have additional clinical improvement and, in most patients, the levodopa or carbidopa dose can be reduced. Withdrawal of bromocriptine therapy is associated in most patients with reversal of its beneficial effects--return of hyperprolactinemia, return of excess growth hormone secretion, and exacerbation of Parkinson's disease.","In a review of 13 cohort studies, bromocriptine improved symptoms and reduced SPLs to normal for 229 of 280 women (82%)."
"What is the best duration of steroid therapy for contact dermatitis rhus
Contact dermatitis is a common reason for patient visits to primary-care clinics and represents up to 7% of all dermatologic consultations in the US. Substantial progress has been made in elucidating the pathophysiology of contact dermatitis, particularly the allergic form. A better understanding of pathologic mechanisms has led to improved management of cases and will continue to advance treatment modalities. The present paper reviews the pathogenesis and current treatment of allergic contact dermatitis and speculates on the prospects for improved future therapy.","A review recommends using systemic steroids for severe cases, defined as involvement of greater than 20% of total body surface area, bullae formation, or extensive facial involvement. That review recommends a starting dose of 1 mg/kg/d, or 40 to 60 mg/d in adults, followed by a 2- to 3-week taper of oral prednisone."
"Does combining aspirin and warfarin decrease the risk of stroke for patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation
Despite the efficacy of warfarin sodium therapy for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation, many physicians hesitate to prescribe it to elderly patients because of the risk for bleeding complications and because of inconvenience for the patients. The Second Copenhagen Atrial Fibrillation, Aspirin, and Anticoagulation Study was a randomized, controlled trial examining the following therapies: warfarin sodium, 1.25 mg/d; warfarin sodium, 1.25 mg/d, plus aspirin, 300 mg/d; and aspirin, 300 mg/d. These were compared with adjusted-dose warfarin therapy (international normalized ratio of prothrombin time [INR], 2.0-3.0). Stroke or a systemic thromboembolic event was the primary outcome event. Transient ischemic attack, acute myocardial infarction, and death were secondary events. Data were handled as survival data, and risk factors were identified using the Cox proportional hazards model. The trial was scheduled for 6 years from May 1, 1993, but due to scientific evidence of inefficiency of low-intensity warfarin plus aspirin therapy from another study, our trial was prematurely terminated on October 2, 1996. We included 677 patients (median age, 74 years). The cumulative primary event rate after 1 year was 5.8% in patients receiving minidose warfarin; 7.2%, warfarin plus aspirin; 3.6%, aspirin; and 2.8%, adjusted-dose warfarin (P = .67). After 3 years, no difference among the groups was seen. Major bleeding events were rare. Although the difference was insignificant, adjusted-dose warfarin seemed superior to minidose warfarin and to warfarin plus aspirin after 1 year of treatment. The results do not justify a change in the current recommendation of adjusted-dose warfarin (INR, 2.0-3.0) for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation.","The Second Copenhagen Atrial Fibrillation, Aspirin, and Anticoagulation Study (AFASAK-2) completed 3 of the scheduled 6 years; it compared warfarin 1.25 mg/d, warfarin 1.25 mg/d plus aspirin 300 mg, aspirin 300 mg alone, and adjusted-dose warfarin (INR=2.0-3.0) to treat non-valvular atrial fibrillation for patients with a median age of 74 years (range, 44-89). The cumulative stroke event rate after 1 year was 5.8% on fixed-dose warfarin, 7.2% on combination, 3.6% on aspirin, and 2.8% on adjusted-dose warfarin. The researchers concluded that while the difference was not statistically significant, adjusted-dose warfarin seemed superior to other treatments after 1 year."
"Should induction of labor be considered in a woman with a macrosomic baby
Suspected macrosomic fetuses are usually induced in order to reduce the risk of difficult operative delivery. The objective of this review was to assess the effects of a policy of labour induction for suspected fetal macrosomia on method of delivery and maternal or perinatal morbidity. We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group trials register and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register. Randomised trials of induction of labour for suspected fetal macrosomia in non-diabetic women. Trial quality assessment and data extraction were done independently by two reviewers. Study authors were contacted for additional information. Two trials involving 313 women were included. Compared to expectant management, induction of labour for suspected macrosomia did not reduce the risk of caesarean section (odds ratio 0.85, 95% confidence interval 0.50 to 1.46) or instrumental delivery (odds ratio 0.98, 95% confidence interval 0.48 to 1.98). Perinatal morbidity was similar between groups. Induction of labour for suspected fetal macrosomia in non-diabetic women did not appear to alter the risk of maternal or neonatal morbidity.","The purpose of induction for fetal macrosomia would be to prevent maternal and neonatal morbidities. However, studies have shown that the incidence of cesarean and instrumented deliveries was not decreased, and perinatal morbidity was not changed."
"What is angular cheilitis and how is it treated
Dentists play a major role as part of an allied health team in providing oral care to patients with diabetes. As such, they may detect undiagnosed cases of diabetes and refer patients to physicians for further evaluation. The author describes new concepts in metabolic control for diabetes and the relationship of oral complications to diabetes mellitus. The treatment of acute oral infections and the dentist's role in supporting patients in smoking-cessation programs are approaches that may reduce morbidity from diabetes mellitus. In consultation with the patient's physician, the dentist may need to modify the treatment plan where systemic complications are present. Working with the physician, nutritionist and dental hygienist, the dentist can maintain the patient's oral health and possibly improve the patient's metabolic control of diabetes. In consultation with the patient's physician, the dentist can discuss the indications and contraindications of medications for the treatment of oral complications in patients with systemic complications resulting from diabetes. Using a glucometer may avert emergencies related to diabetes. The dental team can improve the metabolic control of a patient's diabetes by maintaining optimal oral health. The dentist also can reduce comorbidity factors by supporting patients in tobacco-use cessation programs. Dentists can reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with diabetes by maintaining their patients' oral health and by referring patients with signs and symptoms of oral complications suggestive of diabetes to physicians for further evaluation.",The American Dental Association does mention topical antifungal creams for the treatment of angular cheilitis when discussing oral health and diabetes.
"What are contraindications to IUDs
The intrauterine contraceptive device (IUD) is highly effective and cost-effective. IUD use is limited in some regions, however, due to concerns about increased risk of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and subsequent complications such as infertility and ectopic pregnancy. Recent reviews suggest that the overall risk of PID with modern IUDs is lower than previously thought, at least in regions with a low prevalence of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Risk of PID may be higher, however, in places where gonorrhoea and chlamydia are prevalent, where screening for STIs is limited and where aseptic conditions for insertion are difficult to ensure. A World Health Organization multi-centre study and other studies have confirmed regional differences in STI prevalence, and the WHO study established that PID risk is temporally related to IUD insertion procedures. Studies of the effectiveness of antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent infectious complications are inconclusive due at least in part to use of sub-therapeutic regimens for pathogens commonly implicated in PID. In summary, the IUD can be safe and effective if inserted under aseptic conditions in women free of cervical infection. Further study is needed to define appropriate standards of care for IUD insertion where STI prevalence is high and ability to rule out infection is limited. Even with safe insertion, IUD promotion in areas of high STI/HIV prevalence must address women's needs for dual protection from infection and unwanted pregnancy.","In the US, approximately 1 in 1000 women develop pelvic inflammatory disease after IUD insertion."
"What's the best way to motivate patients to exercise
To assess the long term effectiveness of the ""green prescription"" programme, a clinician based initiative in general practice that provides counselling on physical activity. Cluster randomised controlled trial. Practices were randomised before systematic screening and recruitment of patients. 42 rural and urban general practices in one region of New Zealand. All sedentary 40-79 year old patients visiting their general practitioner during the study's recruitment period. General practitioners were prompted by the patient to give oral and written advice on physical activity during usual consultations. Exercise specialists continued support by telephone and post. Control patients received usual care. Change in physical activity, quality of life (as measured by the ""short form 36"" (SF-36) questionnaire), cardiovascular risk (Framingham and D'Agostino equations), and blood pressure over a 12 month period. 74% (117/159) of general practitioners and 66% (878/1322) of screened eligible patients participated in the study. The follow up rate was 85% (750/878). Mean total energy expenditure increased by 9.4 kcal/kg/week (P=0.001) and leisure exercise by 2.7 kcal/kg/week (P=0.02) or 34 minutes/week more in the intervention group than in the control group (P=0.04). The proportion of the intervention group undertaking 2.5 hours/week of leisure exercise increased by 9.72% (P=0.003) more than in the control group (number needed to treat=10.3). SF-36 measures of self rated ""general health,"" ""role physical,"" ""vitality,"" and ""bodily pain"" improved significantly more in the intervention group (P<0.05). A trend towards decreasing blood pressure became apparent but no significant difference in four year risk of coronary heart disease. Counselling patients in general practice on exercise is effective in increasing physical activity and improving quality of life over 12 months.",A trial in 42 rural and urban New Zealand general practices that added 3 telephone follow-up sessions to the green prescription showed a 10% increase in achieving 150 minutes of vigorous exercise weekly among green prescription participants compared with controls (number needed to treat=10).
"Is therapy based on endoscopy results better than empiric therapy for dyspepsia
The recommended strategy for management of dyspepsia is empirical treatment with an H2-blocking drug, followed by endoscopy if the symptoms do not respond or recur. We compared two strategies for the management of dyspepsia--treatment based on the results of prompt endoscopy (group 1) and empirical H2-blocker treatment with diagnostic endoscopy only in cases of therapeutic failure or symptomatic relapse within 1 year (group 2). Eligible patients had symptoms severe enough to justify empirical H2-blocker therapy. Symptoms, drug consumption, and sick-leave days were assessed through monthly diaries. Patients with non-organic dyspepsia diagnosed by endoscopy did not receive ulcer drugs. Of 414 patients randomised, 373 completed 1-year follow-up. Organic disease was found at endoscopy in 68 (33%) of 208 group-1 patients (ulcer in 45). Endoscopy was done in 136 (66%) of 206 group-2 patients. Case selection for endoscopy was not improved by the empirical treatment strategy, since the diagnostic profile was the same as in group 1 and 40% of the expected ulcer cases remained undiagnosed. After 1 year there were no differences in symptoms or quality of life measures. The empirical treatment strategy in dyspepsia was associated with higher costs, due mainly to a higher number of sick-leave days and cost of ulcer drug use. Prompt endoscopy is a cost-effective strategy in dyspeptic patients with symptoms severe enough to justify the current practice of empirical H2-blocker treatment.","In a trial of 414 patients randomized after referral to specialty care, patients in the early endoscopy group were more satisfied with their medical care than those receiving empiric antisecretory therapy (RR=0.13; 95% CI, 0.06-0.29)."
"Does the age you introduce food to an infant affect allergies later
In a study of fish and citrus allergy these foods were strictly avoided in 177 children up to 1 year of age, whereas 152 children had started taking fish before age 6 months and 145 children had started taking citrus fruits beofre 3 months. Both fish and citrus allergy, defined by a positive challenge, were found at age 3 years in a similar frequency (about 3%) in children with and without the first-year elimination. The results suggest that food allergy in childhood can be postponed but not prevented by dietary elimination in infancy.","A prospective interventional cohort study using a retrospective cohort as a control (n=375) compared children who had strictly avoided fish and citrus products until 1 year of age with those who had an unrestricted diet. There was no difference in the frequency of allergy to these foods as quantified by history and positive challenge test, although the authors did not include a statistical analysis of their results."
"What is the best approach to prevention and treatment of osteoporosis
Smoking is recognized as a risk factor for vertebral, forearm, and hip fractures. Since bone density is an important determinant of bone strength, we conducted a study to ascertain whether a deficit in bone density is associated with tobacco use and, if so, to identify the responsible mechanisms. We conducted a cross-sectional study of bone density at the lumbar spine and the femoral neck and shaft in 41 pairs of female twins (21 monozygotic pairs), 27 to 73 years of age (mean, 49), who were discordant for at least 5 pack-years of smoking (mean, 23; maximum, 64). Bone density was measured by dual-photon absorptiometry. The difference in bone density between the members of a pair was expressed as a percentage of the mean value for the pair. For every 10 pack-years of smoking, the bone density of the twin who smoked more heavily was 2.0 percent lower at the lumbar spine (P = 0.01), 0.9 percent lower at the femoral neck (P = 0.25), and 1.4 percent lower at the femoral shaft (P = 0.04). These results were not confounded by measured lifestyle factors. In the 20 pairs who were discordant by 20 or more pack-years (mean, 35), the (mean +/- SE) within-pair differences in bone density at the three sites were 9.3 +/- 3.1 percent (P = 0.008), 5.8 +/- 2.9 percent (P = 0.06), and 6.5 +/- 3.2 percent (P = 0.05), respectively. Smoking was associated with higher serum concentrations of follicle-stimulating hormone (P = 0.02) and luteinizing hormone (P = 0.03) and lower serum concentrations of parathyroid hormone (P = 0.05). Differences in spinal bone density between members of a pair were associated with differences in the serum concentrations of parathyroid hormone (P = 0.01) and calcium (P = 0.05) and urinary pyridinoline excretion (P = 0.06), a marker of bone resorption. Women who smoke one pack of cigarettes each day throughout adulthood will, by the time of menopause, have an average deficit of 5 to 10 percent in bone density, which is sufficient to increase the risk of fracture.",Smoking cessation may also increase bone density.
"When should you treat scabies empirically
To investigate an outbreak of scabies in an inner-city teaching hospital, identify pathways of transmission, institute effective control measures to end the outbreak, and prevent future occurrences. Outbreak investigation, case-control study, and chart review. Large tertiary acute-care hospital. A patient with unrecognized Norwegian (crusted) scabies was admitted to the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) service of a 940-bed acute-care hospital. Over 4 months, 773 healthcare workers (HCWs) and 204 patients were exposed to scabies. Of the exposed HCWs, 147 (19%) worked on the AIDS service. Risk factors for being infested with scabies among HCWs included working on the AIDS service (odds ratio [OR], 5.3; 95% confidence interval [CI95], 2.17-13.15) and being a nurse, physical therapist, or HCW with extensive physical contact with infected patients (OR, 4.5; CI95, 1.26-17.45). Aggressive infection control precautions beyond Centers for Disease Control and Prevention barrier and isolation recommendations were instituted, including the following: (1) early identification of infected patients; (2) prophylactic treatment with topical applications for all exposed HCWs; (3) use of two treatments 1 week apart for all cases of Norwegian scabies; (4) maintaining isolation for 8 days and barrier precautions for 24 hours after completing second treatment for a diagnosis of Norwegian scabies; and (5) oral ivermectin for treatment of patients who failed conventional therapy. HCWs with the most patient contact are at highest risk of acquiring scabies. Because HCWs who used traditionally accepted barriers while caring for patients with Norwegian scabies continued to develop scabies, we found additional measures were required in the acute-care hospital. HCWs with skin exposure to patients with scabies should receive prophylactic treatment. We recommend (1) using heightened barrier precautions for care of patients with scabies and (2) extending the isolation period for 8 days or 24 hours after the second treatment with a scabicide for those patients with Norwegian scabies. Oral ivermectin was well tolerated for treating patients and HCWs who failed conventional treatment. Finally, we developed a surveillance system that provides a ""barometric measure"" of the infection rate in the community. If scabies increases in the community, a tiered triage system is activated to protect against transmission among HCWs or hospital patients.","One case-control study, performed at a large tertiary-care teaching hospital, demonstrated that health care workers on a service having a patient with undiagnosed scabies were 5.3 times more likely to develop a pruritic rash than those in other units. Health care workers with more skin-to-skin contact with the patients (nurses, nursing students, and physical therapists) were 4.5 times more likely to develop scabies compared with those in less physical contact (physicians, medical students, and occupational therapists). Among the symptomatic health care workers, 17% of their household contacts developed scabies, too."
"What is the appropriate evaluation and treatment of children who are ""toe walkers""
Outcomes from observation or cast or surgical treatment of idiopathic toe-walking were determined in 136 children. With patient-determined outcomes, for the observation group, gait was normal in 6%, improved in 45%, and unchanged in 49%. Physician-determined outcomes demonstrated normal gait in 12% of children. Outcomes were similar in the cast group. With patient-determined outcomes in the surgical group, 22% walked normally, 50% had improved, 26% were unchanged, and 2% had deteriorated; with physician-determined outcomes, 37% walked normally. The natural history, determined from the observation group, was for idiopathic toe-walking to persist, albeit with improvement in 50%. Cast treatment did not alter the natural history. Surgical treatment may influence the outcome, but indications for surgery need to be clarified.","In a case series (n=136), the frequency of toe-walking decreased in 51% of those in both the observation and casted groups. In this same study, the surgical group had lower rates of toe-walking, but no direct comparisons could be made to the nonsurgical groups because the patients in the surgical group were older and had longer follow-up than the other groups."
"Does reducing smoking in the home protect children from the effects of second-hand smoke
To determine the effectiveness of a cotinine-feedback, behaviorally based education intervention in reducing environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) exposure and health-care utilization of children with asthma. Randomized controlled trial of educational intervention vs usual care. The pediatric pulmonary service of a regional pediatric hospital. ETS-exposed, Medicaid/Medi-Cal-eligible, predominantly minority children who were 3 to 12 years old and who were seen for asthma in the hospital's emergency, inpatient, and outpatient services departments (n = 87). Three nurse-led sessions employing behavior-changing strategies and basic asthma education and that incorporated repeated feedback on the child's urinary cotinine level. The primary measurements were the urinary cotinine/creatinine ratio (CCR) and the number of acute asthma medical visits. The secondary measurements were number of hospitalizations, smoking restrictions in home, amount smoked, reported exposures of children, and asthma control. The intervention was associated with a significantly lower odds ratio (OR) for more than one acute asthma medical visit in the follow-up year, after adjusting for baseline visits (total visits, 87; OR, 0.32; p = 0.03), and a comparably sized but nonsignificant OR for one or more hospitalization (OR, 0.34; p = 0.14). The follow-up CCR measurement and the determination of whether smoking was prohibited inside the home strongly favored the intervention group (n = 51) (mean difference in CCR adjusted for baseline, -0.38; p = 0.26; n = 51) (60; OR [for proportion of subjects prohibiting smoking], 0.24; p = 0.11; n = 60). This intervention significantly reduced asthma health-care utilization in ETS-exposed, low-income, minority children. Effects sizes for urine cotinine and proportion prohibiting smoking were moderate to large but not statistically significant, possibly the result of reduced precision due to the loss of patients to active follow-up. Improving ETS reduction interventions and understanding their mechanism of action on asthma outcomes requires further controlled trials that measure ETS exposure and behavioral and disease outcomes concurrently.","A 2001 trial randomized 81 families with a smoking parent and an asthmatic child between 3 and 12 years of age to 3 sessions of behavioral and educational counseling or usual care at an outpatient asthma clinic. Parental education included information on second-hand smoke, basic asthma education, and feedback about urine cotinine levels (a marker of nicotine absorption). Behavioral counseling focused on reducing second-hand smoke exposure by caregivers. The education group had a significantly reduced risk of 2 or more asthma-related clinic visits in the following 12 months compared with usual care (odds ratio=0.32; P=.03; number needed to treat=5). No significant decrease was noted in mean urine cotinine levels between groups (adjusted mean difference=-0.38 ng/mg favoring education; P=.26)."
"What is the initial approach to the treatment of shoulder pain
A multi-dose, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter study was conducted to evaluate 68 patients with acute bursitis or tendinitis following treatment with flurbiprofen (Ansaid, Upjohn) or placebo. Flurbiprofen was administered in a total daily dosage of 200 to 300 mg four times daily. Based on efficacy rating scales, flurbiprofen-treated patients had the greatest proportion of improvement at almost all time periods. They also showed statistically significant improvement compared with placebo-treated patients, according to investigators' overall assessments at all time periods. Most patients showed improvement within three to four days of treatment. Flurbiprofen was both well tolerated and effective for the relief of pain caused by bursitis or tendinitis of the shoulder.","A randomized controlled trial found 14-day treatment with oral NSAIDs superior to placebo for relieving acute shoulder pain (86% vs 56%; absolute risk reduction 30%; 95% confidence interval, 10%-50%)."
"Does breastfeeding protect against viral gastrointestinal infections in children <2 years old
To assess the relationship between breast-feeding and the risk of life-threatening rotavirus diarrhea among Bangladeshi infants and children younger than 24 months of age. Case-control study. A rural Bangladesh community. One hundred two cases with clinically severe rotavirus diarrhea detected in a treatment center-based surveillance system during 1985 and 1986, and 2587 controls selected in three surveys of the same community during the same calendar interval. Cases and controls were compared for the frequency of antecedent breast-feeding patterns. Compared with other feeding modes, exclusive breast-feeding of infants was associated with significant protection against severe rotavirus diarrhea (relative risk (RR) = 0.10; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.03, 0.34). However, during the second year of life, the risk of this outcome was higher in breast-fed than in non-breast-fed children (RR = 2.85; 95% CI = 0.37, 21.71), and no overall protection was associated with breast-feeding during the first 2 years of life (RR = 2.61; 95% CI = 0.62, 11.02). Although exclusive breast-feeding appeared to protect infants against severe rotavirus diarrhea, breast-feeding per se conferred no overall protection during the first 2 years of life, suggesting that breast-feeding temporarily postponed rather than prevented this outcome. While not detracting from efforts to promote breast-feeding to alleviate the burden of diarrhea due to nonrotaviral enteropathogens, our findings cast doubt on whether such efforts will impact on the problem of severe rotavirus diarrhea.","A case-control study in Bangladesh suggests that breastfed infants have a higher incidence of rotavirus diarrhea, but selection of diarrhea patients as controls may have underestimated the protective effect. Although breastfeeding was not found to provide overall protection from developing rotavirus gastroenteritis, exclusive breastfeeding appeared to protect against severe rotavirus diarrhea for infants aged <2 years."
"Do TZDs increase the risk of heart failure for patients with diabetes
Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) are widely used oral antihyperglycemic drugs that facilitate insulin action and increase insulin-stimulated glucose metabolism, thereby decreasing insulin resistance. However, concerns have been raised regarding the association between TZD use and a heightened risk for congestive heart failure (CHF). This study used claims data to conduct a retrospective examination of the CHF risk in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and to compare the association with CHF in those receiving the TZD pioglitazone and those receiving insulin. Patients with type 2 diabetes aged > or =18 years who had begun treatment with pioglitazone or insulin between January 1999 and December 2001 were identified using the PharMetrics Patient-Centric database. The sample was restricted to patients for whom there were > or =12 months of data before the index date (date of the first prescription for pioglitazone or insulin) and > or =3 months of follow-up data. Patients receiving a diagnosis of CHF before the index date were excluded. The propensity score for receiving pioglitazone was estimated using logistic regression based on available observed patient characteristics. Patients receiving insulin were matched in a 1:1 ratio with patients receiving pioglitazone based on a difference of no more than +/-0.01 in the estimated propensity score for receiving pioglitazone therapy. CHF risk was examined using the Cox proportional-hazards model. After exclusion of ineligible patients, 1668 matched pairs of patients receiving pioglitazone or insulin were identified (50.9% men, 49.1% women; mean [SE] age, 51.2 [0.2] years). The 2-year crude incidence rate of CHF was significantly lower in the pioglitazone group compared with the insulin group (primary/secondary diagnosis of CHF, 2.0% vs 4.0%, respectively; P < 0.001; inpatient hospitalization for CHF, 0.7% vs 2.5%; P < 0.001). The hazard ratio for pioglitazone versus insulin was 0.501 (95% CI, 0.331-0.758; P = 0.001) for a primary or secondary diagnosis of CHF in any setting and 0.263 (95% CI, 0.135-0.511; P < 0.001) for any occurrence of an inpatient hospitalization for CHF. In this retrospective analysis of data from patients with type 2 diabetes, pioglitazone therapy was associated with significantly lower incidence rates of CHF and inpatient hospitalization compared with insulin therapy.","Another manufacturer-sponsored retrospective cohort study of pioglitazone analyzed insurance claims data to compare the incidence of congestive heart failure among 1668 adult patients taking pioglitazone (and possibly other medications, but not insulin) vs 1668 adult patients taking insulin (and possibly other medications, but not a TZD). The 2 groups were matched in terms of comorbid conditions, but statistical analysis did not take disease severity into account. The incidence of congestive heart failure was 2% of pioglitazone users compared with 4% of patients using insulin (NNH for insulin=50). In addition, CHF-related hospitalizations were 0.7% for congestive heart failure in the pioglitazone group vs 2.5% in the insulin group (NNH for insulin=55). Both of these findings are statistically significant."
"Are there big differences among beta-blockers in treating essential hypertension
The National High Blood Pressure Education Program presents the complete Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure. Like its predecessors, the purpose is to provide an evidence-based approach to the prevention and management of hypertension. The key messages of this report are these: in those older than age 50, systolic blood pressure (BP) of greater than 140 mm Hg is a more important cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor than diastolic BP; beginning at 115/75 mm Hg, CVD risk doubles for each increment of 20/10 mm Hg; those who are normotensive at 55 years of age will have a 90% lifetime risk of developing hypertension; prehypertensive individuals (systolic BP 120-139 mm Hg or diastolic BP 80-89 mm Hg) require health-promoting lifestyle modifications to prevent the progressive rise in blood pressure and CVD; for uncomplicated hypertension, thiazide diuretic should be used in drug treatment for most, either alone or combined with drugs from other classes; this report delineates specific high-risk conditions that are compelling indications for the use of other antihypertensive drug classes (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers); two or more antihypertensive medications will be required to achieve goal BP (<140/90 mm Hg, or <130/80 mm Hg) for patients with diabetes and chronic kidney disease; for patients whose BP is more than 20 mm Hg above the systolic BP goal or more than 10 mm Hg above the diastolic BP goal, initiation of therapy using two agents, one of which usually will be a thiazide diuretic, should be considered; regardless of therapy or care, hypertension will be controlled only if patients are motivated to stay on their treatment plan. Positive experiences, trust in the clinician, and empathy improve patient motivation and satisfaction. This report serves as a guide, and the committee continues to recognize that the responsible physician's judgment remains paramount.",The Joint National Committee on Hypertension JNC-7 states that excellent clinical trial data demonstrate that lowering blood pressure with beta-blockers and several other drug classes will reduce the complications of hypertension.
"What is the best way to diagnose a suspected rotator cuff tear
To evaluate the evidence for the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the newer diagnostic imaging tests as an addition to clinical examination and patient history for the diagnosis of soft tissue shoulder disorders. Literature was identified from several sources including general medical databases. Studies were identified that evaluated clinical examination, ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or magnetic resonance arthrography (MRA) in patients suspected of having soft tissue shoulder disorders. Outcomes assessed were clinical impingement syndrome or rotator cuff tear (full, partial or any). Only cohort studies were included. The methodological quality of included test accuracy studies was assessed using a formal quality assessment tool for diagnostic studies and the extraction of study findings was conducted in duplicate using a pre-designed and piloted data extraction form to avoid any errors. For each test, sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative likelihood ratios with 95% confidence intervals were calculated for each study. Where possible pooled estimates of sensitivity, specificity and likelihood ratios were calculated using random effects methods. Potential sources of heterogeneity were investigated by conducting subgroup analyses. In the included studies, the prevalence of rotator cuff disorders was generally high, partial verification of patients was common and in many cases patients who were selected retrospectively because they had undergone the reference test. Sample sizes were generally very small. Reference tests were often inappropriate with many studies using arthrography alone, despite problems with its sensitivity. For clinical assessment, 10 cohort studies were found that examined either the accuracy of individual tests or clinical examination as a whole: individual tests were either good at ruling out rotator cuff tears when negative (high sensitivity) or at ruling in such disorders when positive (high specificity), but small sample sizes meant that there was no conclusive evidence. Ultrasound was investigated in 38 cohort studies and found to be most accurate when used for the detection of full-thickness tears; sensitivity was lower for detection of partial-thickness tears. For MRI, 29 cohort studies were included. For full-thickness tears, overall pooled sensitivities and specificities were fairly high and the studies were not statistically heterogeneous; however for the detection of partial-thickness rotator cuff tears, the pooled sensitivity estimate was much lower. The results from six MRA studies suggested that it may be very accurate for detection of full-thickness rotator cuff tears, although its performance for the detection of partial-thickness tears was less consistent. Direct evidence for the performance of one test compared with another is very limited. The results suggest that clinical examination by specialists can rule out the presence of a rotator cuff tear, and that either MRI or ultrasound could equally be used for detection of full-thickness rotator cuff tears, although ultrasound may be better at picking up partial tears. Ultrasound also may be more cost-effective in a specialist hospital setting for identification of full-thickness tears. Further research suggestions include the need for large, well-designed, prospective studies of the diagnosis of shoulder pain, in particular a follow-up study of patients with shoulder pain in primary care and a prospective cohort study of clinical examination, ultrasound and MRI, alone and/or in combination.","A meta-analysis of 10 cohort studies found the overall sensitivity and specificity of a clinical exam to rule out a full-thickness rotator cuff tear to be 0.9 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.87-0.93) and 0.54 (95% CI, 0.47-0.61). However, no single physical exam finding provided comparable accuracy."
"How should we manage a patient with a positive PPD and prior BCG vaccination
The accurate diagnosis of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is an important component of any tuberculosis control programme and depends largely on tuberculin skin testing. The appropriate interpretation of skin test results requires knowledge of the possible confounding factors such as previous BCG vaccination. Uncertainty about the effect of BCG vaccination on tuberculin skin testing and the strength with which recommendations are made to individual patients regarding treatment of LTBI have identified a need to analyse the available data on the effect of BCG on skin testing. A meta-analysis of the evidence for the effect of BCG vaccination on tuberculin skin testing in subjects without active tuberculosis was therefore performed. Medline was searched for English language articles published from 1966 to 1999 using the key words ""BCG vaccine"", ""tuberculin test/PPD"", and ""skin testing"". Bibliographies of relevant articles were reviewed for additional studies that may have been missed in the Medline search. Articles were considered for inclusion in the meta-analysis if they had recorded tuberculin skin test results in subjects who had received BCG vaccination more than 5 years previously and had a concurrent control group. Only prospective studies were considered. The geographical location, number of participants, type of BCG vaccine used, type of tuberculin skin test performed, and the results of the tuberculin skin test were extracted. The abstracts and titles of 980 articles were identified, 370 full text articles were reviewed, and 26 articles were included in the final analysis. Patients who had received BCG vaccination were more likely to have a positive skin test (5 TU PPD: relative risk (RR) 2.12 (95% confidence interval (CI)1.50 to 3.00); 2 TU RT23: 2.65 [corrected] (95% CI 1.83 to 3.85). The effect of BCG vaccination on PPD skin test results was less after 15 years. Positive skin tests with indurations of >15 mm are more likely to be the result of tuberculous infection than of BCG vaccination. In subjects without active tuberculosis, immunisation with BCG significantly increases the likelihood of a positive tuberculin skin test. The interpretation of the skin test therefore needs to be made in the individual clinical context and with evaluation of other risk factors for infection. The size of the induration should also be considered when making recommendations for treatment of latent infection.",A 2002 meta-analysis showed that the person's age at the time of their BCG vaccination and the years since vaccination influence the relative risk of a positive PPD. The highest relative risk of a positive PPD occurred among patients who received BCG vaccination after infancy and within 15 years of the PPD testing. This same meta-analysis also examined the significance of the size of the PPD response; a subset of 4 studies showed that equal proportions of BCG vaccinated and unvaccinated patients had indurations of 14 mm or more.
"Do abnormal fetal kick counts predict intrauterine death in average-risk pregnancies
Fetal movement counting is a method by which a woman quantifies the movements she feels to assess the condition of the baby. The purpose is to try to reduce perinatal mortality by alerting caregivers when the baby might have become compromised. This method may be used routinely, or only in women who are considered at increased risk of complications in the baby. Some clinicians believe that fetal movement counting is a good method as it allows the clinician to make appropriate interventions in good time. On the other hand, fetal movement counting may cause anxiety to women. To assess outcomes of pregnancy where fetal movement counting was done routinely, selectively or was not done at all; and to compare different methods of fetal movement counting. We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 September 2006), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library) and the reference lists of relevant papers. Randomised controlled trials. Trials were excluded where allocation concealment was inadequate and no measures were taken to prevent bias were excluded. The interventions included routine fetal movement counting, selective fetal movement counting, and studies comparing different fetal assessment methods. We assessed the methodological quality of included studies and extracted data from studies. Four studies, involving 71,370 women, were included in this review; 68,654 in one cluster-randomised trial. All four trials compared formal fetal movement counting. Two trials compared different types of counting with each other; one with no formal instruction, and one with hormonal analysis. Women in the formal fetal movement counting group had significantly fewer visits to the hospital antenatally than those women randomised to hormone analysis (relative risk (RR) 0.26, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.20 to 0.35), whereas there were fewer Apgar scores less than seven in five minutes for women randomised to hormone analysis (RR 1.72, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.93). There was a significantly higher compliance with the Cardiff 'count to ten' method than with the formal fetal movement counting method (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.32).All other outcomes reported were non significant. This review does not provide enough evidence to influence practice. In particular, no trials compared fetal movement counting with no fetal movement counting. Robust research is needed in this area.",A recent rigorous systematic review yielded no significant outcome effect related to fetal kick counts.
"What is the best hypnotic for use in the elderly
Insomnia affects 30-35% of people living in developed countries. The impact of insomnia on daytime functioning and its relationship with medical and psychiatric illnesses necessitate early treatment to prevent insomnia becoming persistent and to avoid the development of complications. However, pharmacological strategies must achieve a balance between sedative and adverse effects. In the last 30 years, benzodiazepines have been the preferred drugs for the treatment of insomnia. Benzodiazepines act nonselectively at two central receptor sites, named omega(1) and omega(2), which are located in different areas of the CNS. The sedative action of benzodiazepines is related to omega(1) receptors, whereas omega(2) receptors are responsible for their effects on memory and cognitive functioning. According to their pharmacokinetic profile, benzodiazepines can be classified into three groups: short half-life (<3 hours), medium half-life (8-24 hours) and long half-life (>24 hours). The newer non-benzodiazepine agents zopiclone, zolpidem and zaleplon have a hypnosedative action comparable with that of benzodiazepines, but they display specific pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. These three 'Z' agents all share a short plasma half-life and limited duration of action. In addition, these agents are selective compounds that interact preferentially with omega(1) receptors (sedative effect), whereas benzodiazepines also interact with omega(2) receptors (adverse effects on cognitive performance and memory). Zaleplon is characterised by an ultrashort half-life (approximately 1 hour). Zolpidem and zopiclone have longer half-lives (approximately 2.4 and 5 hours, respectively). These properties, together with the low risk of residual effect, may explain the limited negative influences of these agents on daytime performance. Psychomotor tasks and memory capacities appear to be better preserved by non-benzodiazepine agents than by benzodiazepines. When present, cognitive deficits almost exclusively coincide with the peak plasma concentration. In particular, impairment can emerge in the first hours after drug administration, whereas psychomotor and memory tests carried out 7-8 hours later (i.e. in the morning) generally show no relevant alterations. As with benzodiazepines, the three 'Z' non-benzodiazepine agents should be used for a limited period, even in chronic relapsing conditions. Further evaluation is needed of the safety of hypnosedative medications in the long-term management of insomnia.","They have been shown to decrease sleep latency, increase total sleep time, and increase sleep efficiency without disturbing sleep architecture or adversely affecting memory."
"What's the best treatment for CIN 2 or 3
Conservative methods to treat cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and microinvasive cervical cancer are commonly used in young women because of the advent of effective screening programmes. In a meta-analysis, we investigated the effect of these procedures on subsequent fertility and pregnancy outcomes. We searched for studies in MEDLINE and EMBASE and classified them by the conservative method used and the outcome measure studied regarding both fertility and pregnancy. Pooled relative risks and 95% CIs were calculated with a random-effects model and interstudy heterogeneity was assessed with Cochrane's Q test. We identified 27 studies. Cold knife conisation was significantly associated with preterm delivery (<37 weeks; relative risk 2.59, 95% CI 1.80-3.72, 100/704 [14%] vs 1494/27 674 [5%]), low birthweight (<2500 g; 2.53, 1.19-5.36, 32/261 [12%] vs 905/13 229 [7%]), and caesarean section (3.17, 1.07-9.40, 31/350 [9%] vs 22/670 [3%]). Large loop excision of the transformation zone (LLETZ) was also significantly associated with preterm delivery (1.70, 1.24-2.35, 156/1402 [11%] vs 120/1739 [7%]), low birthweight (1.82, 1.09-3.06, 77/996 [8%] vs 49/1192 [4%]), and premature rupture of the membranes (2.69, 1.62-4.46, 48/905 [5%] vs 22/1038 [2%]). Similar but marginally non-significant adverse effects were recorded for laser conisation (preterm delivery 1.71, 0.93-3.14). We did not detect significantly increased risks for obstetric outcomes after laser ablation. Although severe outcomes such as admission to a neonatal intensive care unit or perinatal mortality showed adverse trends, these changes were not significant. All the excisional procedures to treat cervical intraepithelial neoplasia present similar pregnancy-related morbidity without apparent neonatal morbidity. Caution in the treatment of young women with mild cervical abnormalities should be recommended. Clinicians now have the evidence base to counsel women appropriately.","A meta-analysis of 27 controlled cohort studies found that cold knife conization and loop electrosurgical excision procedure were associated with increased obstetrical risks, such as delivery at less than 37 weeks' gestation and a birth weight <2500 g. Any resection that was more than 10 mm deep increased the risk of prematurity with future pregnancies (pooled relative risk=2.6; 95%] CI, 1.3-5.3)."
"Should we screen women for hypothyroidism
Increasing use of assays for TSH with improved sensitivity as a first-line test of thyroid function has raised questions regarding prevalence and clinical significance of abnormal results, especially values below normal. We have assessed the thyroid status of 1210 patients aged over 60 registered with a single general practice by measurement of serum TSH using a sensitive assay. High TSH values were more common in females (11.6%) than males (2.9%). TSH values below normal were present in 6.3% of females and 5.5% of males, with values below the limit of detection of the assay present in 1.5% of females and 1.4% of males. Anti-thyroid antibodies were found in 60% of those with high TSH but only 5.6% of those with subnormal TSH. Eighteen patients were hypothyroid (high TSH, low free thyroxine) and one thyrotoxic (low TSH, raised free thyroxine) at initial testing. Seventy-three patients with elevated TSH but normal free T4 were followed for 12 months; 13 (17.8%) developed low free T4 levels and commenced thyroxine, TSH returned to normal in four (5.5%) and 56 (76.7%) continued to have high TSH values. Sixty-six patients with TSH results below normal were followed. Of the 50 subjects with low but detectable TSH at initial testing, 38 (76%) returned to normal at 12 months; of those 16 with undetectable TSH followed, 14 (87.5%) remained low at 12 months. Only one subject (who had an undetectable TSH) developed thyrotoxicosis. In view of the marked prevalence of thyroid dysfunction in the elderly, we suggest that screening of all patients over 60 should be considered.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","Among 1210 primary care patients (700 women) aged >60 years, 73 women with subclinical hypothyroidism were identified and followed for 12 months.

"What are effective strategies for reducing the risk of steroid-induced osteoporosis
Osteoporosis is a common complication of long-term glucocorticoid therapy for which there is no well-proved preventive or restorative treatment. We carried out two 48-week, randomized, placebo-controlled studies of two doses of alendronate in 477 men and women, 17 to 83 years of age, who were receiving glucocorticoid therapy. The primary end point was the difference in the mean percent change in lumbar-spine bone density from base line to week 48 between the groups. Secondary outcomes included changes in bone density of the hip, biochemical markers of bone turnover, and the incidence of new vertebral fractures. The mean (+/-SE) bone density of the lumbar spine increased by 2.1+/-0.3 percent and 2.9+/-0.3 percent, respectively, in the groups that received 5 and 10 mg of alendronate per day (P<0.001) and decreased by 0.4+/-0.3 percent in the placebo group. The femoral-neck bone density increased by 1.2+/-0.4 percent and 1.0+/-0.4 percent in the respective alendronate groups (P<0.01) and decreased by 1.2+/-0.4 percent in the placebo group (P<0.01). The bone density of the trochanter and total body also increased significantly in the patients treated with alendronate. There were proportionally fewer new vertebral fractures in the alendronate groups (overall incidence, 2.3 percent) than in the placebo group (3.7 percent) (relative risk, 0.6; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.1 to 4.4). Markers of bone turnover decreased significantly in the alendronate groups (P<0.001). There were no differences in serious adverse effects among the three groups, but there was a small increase in nonserious upper gastrointestinal effects in the group receiving 10 mg of alendronate. Alendronate increases bone density in patients receiving glucocorticoid therapy.","A 48-week randomized controlled trials involving 477 patients receiving steroids who also received alendronate or placebo demonstrated a 2.3% and 3.7% in incidence of vertebral fracture, respectively (RRR = 38%; absolute risk reduction = 1.4%; P= NS)."
"What screening tests should you use to evaluate a man with low testosterone
The authors evaluated nursing home residents with a prior history of hip fracture for osteopenia and its risk factors, and attempted to learn to what extent the residents' bone status had been considered by their primary care physicians. Thirty-one hip fracture residents in the Milwaukee VA nursing home were studied to determine their status with regard to bone mineral density of the proximal femur, and the following risk factors or predictors of osteopenia: history of smoking; history of fractures; calcium and vitamin D intake; underweight; immobility; hypogonadism; and administration of drugs that may accelerate bone demineralization. Data were also collected on the evaluation and management of the post hip fracture residents in three other nursing homes. In the Milwaukee nursing home, out of 31 hip fracture survivors, 74% had sustained a hip fracture before admission to the nursing home; 29% had a history of second fracture. In 84% of patients, there was no mention of osteopenia in the active medical problem list and, therefore, there was no intervention plan in place to improve or prevent further bone loss. Thirty-two percent were underweight, 36% were currently smoking, 55% were immobile, 64% were consuming at least one medication that might increase bone loss, calcium intake was less than 1,000 mg daily in 52%, and 66% were hypogonadal (serum testosterone level less than 300 ng/dL). Chart reviews of the hip fracture survivors at three other nursing homes revealed similar findings. Approximately 5-15% of nursing home residents are hip fracture survivors. They usually have severe osteopenia and multiple risk factors for further bone loss and future fractures.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",A chart review study of nursing home residents found that 66% of men with hip fractures and 20% of men with vertebral fractures had low testosterone.
"What levels of cholesterol should be treated for primary prevention
This is the final report on mortality amongst men in the WHO cooperative trial of the prevention of ischaemic heart disease (IHD) by clofibrate and it takes the follow-up a further 4 years to the end of 1982. Mean observation was 13.2 years, 5.3 in the trial and 7.9 afterwards. 1788 deaths were recorded in 208 000 man-years. In the 877 new deaths reported here, there was an excess of 9 deaths in the high cholesterol control group compared with the clofibrate-treated group. In the whole period there were 70 (11%) more deaths in the clofibrate-treated group. Excess mortality in the clofibrate-treated group was much greater during the ""treatment period"" (there was an excess of 47% during treatment compared with 5% after treatment had ended) and was due to a wide variety of causes other than IHD. Thus, the excess mortality in the clofibrate-treated group has not continued after the end of treatment. The substantial excess previously reported remains unexplained.",Clofibrate is no longer used because of an unexplained increase in deaths in the WHO Cooperative Trial.
"Menstrual disturbances in perimenopausal women: What's best
The charts of 500 sequential perimenopausal patients were reviewed and their alterations in menstrual flow were characterized as fitting one of three patterns. Sixty-two patients (12%) had sudden amenorrhea, 347 (70%) had oligomenorrhea and/or hypomenorrhea, and 91 (18%) had menorrhagia, metrorrhagia, and/or hypermenorrhea. All of the patients in the menorrhagia/metrorrhagia and/or hypermenorrhea group had histologic evaluations to rule out the presence of premalignant or malignant disease; 17 women (19%) in this group had premalignant or malignant findings. In addition, 4 of the 5 women with malignancies had intermenstrual bleeding. Of the 9 women in the study with intermenstrual bleeding, 4 had invasive cancer and 2 had endometrial hyperplasia. This study documents and highlights the high incidence of premalignant and malignant findings in perimenopausal patients with bleeding patterns other than amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea/hypomenorrhea, and underscores the need for perimenopausal women with menorrhagia, metrorrhagia, and/or hypermenorrhea to undergo thorough evaluation.","A review of 500 perimenopausal women seen sequentially by a gynecology service found that 18% had menorrhagia (heavy bleeding), metrorrhagia (intermenstrual bleeding), or hypermenorrhea (frequent periods)."
"For those intolerant to angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors and ARBs, what is the best therapy for reducing the risk of diabetic nephropathy
To determine whether tight control of blood pressure prevents macrovascular and microvascular complications in patients with type 2 diabetes. Randomised controlled trial comparing tight control of blood pressure aiming at a blood pressure of <150/85 mm Hg (with the use of an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril or a beta blocker atenolol as main treatment) with less tight control aiming at a blood pressure of <180/105 mm Hg. 20 hospital based clinics in England, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. 1148 hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes (mean age 56, mean blood pressure at entry 160/94 mm Hg); 758 patients were allocated to tight control of blood pressure and 390 patients to less tight control with a median follow up of 8.4 years. Predefined clinical end points, fatal and non-fatal, related to diabetes, deaths related to diabetes, and all cause mortality. Surrogate measures of microvascular disease included urinary albumin excretion and retinal photography. Mean blood pressure during follow up was significantly reduced in the group assigned tight blood pressure control (144/82 mm Hg) compared with the group assigned to less tight control (154/87 mm Hg) (P<0.0001). Reductions in risk in the group assigned to tight control compared with that assigned to less tight control were 24% in diabetes related end points (95% confidence interval 8% to 38%) (P=0.0046), 32% in deaths related to diabetes (6% to 51%) (P=0.019), 44% in strokes (11% to 65%) (P=0.013), and 37% in microvascular end points (11% to 56%) (P=0.0092), predominantly owing to a reduced risk of retinal photocoagulation. There was a non-significant reduction in all cause mortality. After nine years of follow up the group assigned to tight blood pressure control also had a 34% reduction in risk in the proportion of patients with deterioration of retinopathy by two steps (99% confidence interval 11% to 50%) (P=0.0004) and a 47% reduced risk (7% to 70%) (P=0.004) of deterioration in visual acuity by three lines of the early treatment of diabetic retinopathy study (ETDRS) chart. After nine years of follow up 29% of patients in the group assigned to tight control required three or more treatments to lower blood pressure to achieve target blood pressures. Tight blood pressure control in patients with hypertension and type 2 diabetes achieves a clinically important reduction in the risk of deaths related to diabetes, complications related to diabetes, progression of diabetic retinopathy, and deterioration in visual acuity.","In the UKPDS-Hypertension in Diabetes study (a multicenter randomized study in patients with type 2 diabetes that evaluated the effects of different levels of blood pressure control on diabetic complications), researchers found that patients assigned to the tight-control group (blood pressure goal <150/85 mm Hg) had 37% risk reduction in microvascular endpoints (nephropathy and advanced retinopathy).

Male hypogonadism is a frequent and potentially undertreated condition. A number of longitudinal epidemiologic studies, including the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, the New Mexico Aging Process Study, and the Massachusetts Male Aging Study, have demonstrated age-related increases in the likelihood of developing hypogonadism. In addition to advancing age, increasing body mass index and/or type II diabetes mellitus may be associated with lower circulating androgen levels. Owing to the demographic trends toward increasing population age and life expectancy, together with the emerging pandemic of diabetes and recent trend toward an increasing prevalence of obesity in the United States, clinicians are likely to encounter increasing cases of hypogonadism in the near future.","Men with very low testosterone levels (<150 ng/dL) or signs and symptoms suggesting pituitary pathology warrant pituitary imaging and measurement of thyroxine, cortisol, and prolactin levels."

The second and sixth menstrual cycles were considered baseline and treatment cycles, respectively. Participants kept a menstrual diary throughout the study and provided daily first-void urine samples during cycles 2 and 6. Urine samples were assayed for LH and pregnanediol glucuronide (PdG). The primary end point was change in luteal phase duration as defined by the day of the urinary LH peak to the day preceding the onset of menstruation. Treatment with simvastatin (40 mg/d) effectively lowered LDL-C by 34.3% (P < 0.001). Simvastatin was generally well tolerated, and no meaningful difference in adverse event profile was observed between treatment groups. Compared with the placebo group, simvastatin did not have clinically relevant effects on luteal phase duration, peak PdG concentration, or integrated luteal phase PdG concentration. The results of this study demonstrate that treatment of healthy premenopausal women for approximately 4 months with simvastatin (40 mg/d) lowers LDL-C without adversely affecting reproductive gonadal function. Simvastatin should not be used during pregnancy or by nursing mothers.","Highly lipophilic statins-such as simvastatin, atorvastatin (Lipitor), and lovastatin-achieve embryoplacental concentrations similar to those of maternal plasma. For this reason, if statin therapy is needed, these agents should be avoided. Pravastatin (Pravachol) is the most hydrophilic statin and has no reports of abnormal pregnancy outcomes, even in animal research."
"What is the best way to evaluate acute diarrhea
The yield of in-hospital stool cultures performed more than 72 hours after admission is low, and a commonly used policy dictates that laboratories reject these cultures to save costs. However, enteropathogenic bacteria other than Clostridium difficile (EPB) may cause nosocomial illness that would be missed by use of such a ""3-day rule."" To develop guidelines for hospital use of stool cultures that are sensitive to clinically relevant cases of sporadic and epidemic nosocomial diarrhea. Five-part study that incorporated a derivation sample based on retrospective chart review and a prospective cohort study (including cost savings analysis), and a validation sample based on retrospective chart review. Four European academic health care centers. Derivation sample: 1735 adult inpatients from whom 3416 stool cultures were obtained during a 19-month period (1995-1997) and 68 adult inpatients for whom EPB were grown from stool cultures during a 10-year period (1988-1998); validation sample: 65 patients with sporadic isolation of EPB (1993-1998), 56 patients involved in 2 nosocomial Salmonella outbreaks (1992 and 1997), and 330 patients who had stool cultures performed (1998). Performance of derived criteria in detecting pathogenic bacteria and outbreaks and reducing total number of stool cultures performed. Stool cultures grew EPB in 3.3% of samples obtained </=72 hours after admission and 0.5% of samples obtained thereafter (P<.001). Isolation of EPB >72 hours after admission was not associated with clinical symptoms or signs but was associated with community-acquired diarrhea (24%), age 65 years or older with preexisting comorbid disease (25%), neutropenia (13%), HIV infection (10%), and nondiarrheal manifestations of enteric infections (16%). Twelve percent were asymptomatic carriers. These characteristics were used to create criteria for selecting patients for whom stool cultures would be indicated. These criteria were applied post hoc to a series of 1025 stool cultures; the number of stool cultures would have been reduced by 52% and no clinically significant cases would have been missed. Annual savings to a 355-bed institution would be approximately $7800 for reagent costs and 75 hours of technician time. In the validation samples, only 2 patients of 65 who had EPB would not have been identified, and neither required treatment. If the 3-day rule had been applied, 52 cases would not have been identified, 28 of which required antibiotic treatment. Our modified 3-day rule for use in selecting cases for stool culture is sensitive to sporadic and epidemic cases of nosocomial diarrhea in hospitalized adults.","Using retrospective reviews, Bauer and colleagues developed a prediction rule for cases of infectious diarrhea. The ""modified 3-day rule"" recommends stool cultures for patients with diarrhea beginning more than 3 days after hospitalization only when they fall into 1 of the following groups: patients older than 65 years with permanently altered organ function, those with HIV or neutropenia, those hospitalized during suspected nosocomial outbreaks, and those suspected of nondiarrheal manifestations of enteric infection. When the modified rule was applied prospectively, only 2 cases were missed. Both patients were at risk for immunosuppression, although they did not strictly meet the modified criteria. Neither required treatment."
"What is the best treatment for mild to moderate acne
Adapalene gel 0.1% is approved for use in the treatment of acne vulgaris. A new cream formulation, adapalene cream 0.1%, has been developed. Our objective was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of adapalene cream 0.1% in comparison with its cream vehicle, applied once daily for 12 weeks to patients with facial acne vulgaris. We used a 12-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, comparative phase 3 study of adapalene cream 0.1% and cream vehicle. The study enrolled 237 patients (125 males and 112 females), aged 12 through 30 years, with mild-to-moderate acne vulgaris. Adapalene cream 0.1% demonstrated superior efficacy compared with its cream vehicle. Significantly lower numbers of total inflammatory and noninflammatory lesion counts were observed at the end of the study period in patients using adapalene cream 0.1% as opposed to those using cream vehicle (P<.05 compared with baseline, for all 3 parameters). Adapalene cream 0.1% caused more cutaneous side effects than the cream vehicle, but these were tolerated in most patients. In summary, the results of this study indicate that adapalene cream 0.1% demonstrates superior efficacy over cream vehicle for the treatment of acne vulgaris. Adapalene cream 0.1% also has excellent tolerability and is associated with a low incidence of cutaneous adverse events.",Another 12-week randomized controlled trials of 237 patients with mild to moderate acne demonstrated superior efficacy with 0.1% adapalene cream over placebo (P<.05).
"Which complementary therapies can help patients with PMS
In a prospective, multicentre trial the efficacy of an Vitex agnus castus L extract Ze 440 was investigated in 50 patients with pre-menstrual syndrome (PMS). The patients were treated daily with one tablet (20 mg native extract) during three menstrual cycles. 43 patients completed the study protocol which encompassed 8 menstrual cycles (2 baseline, 3 treatment and 3 post-treatment). 13/43 patients were receiving concomitant oral contraceptives. 6 patients did not complete the study for reasons not related to study medication, and one patient complained of fatigue possibly related to study medication. All evaluated patients took at least 85% of the prescribed medication. The main effect parameter was the validated Moos' menstrual distress questionnaire (MMDQ), and secondary parameters were a visual analogue scale (VAS; self-assessment) and a global impression scale (GI, self-assessment). The study population was homogenous in age (31.3+/-7.7 years) weight (58.9+/-6.9 kg) and cycle length (28.4+/-0.3 d). The diagnosis was according to DMS-III. At the end of the study, PMS-related symptoms were reduced by treatment. There was a significant score reduction (42.5%) of the MMDQ as the main effect parameter (p<0.001). Symptoms gradually returned after treatment cessation. However, a difference from baseline remained (20%; p<0.001) up to 3 cycles thereafter. 20/43 patients were considered ""responders"", with a reduction in MMDQ score by at least 50% relative to baseline. At baseline, the VAS score was elevated in the late luteal phase and low at the follicular phase, as expected. During treatment, VAS score decreased in the late luteal phase (47.2%; p<0.01) and remained 21.7% (p<0.001) below baseline after 3 cycles post-cessation of treatment. The low VAS score within the follicular phase remained unchanged over the whole observation period. 38 patients judged the global efficacy moderate to excellent, 5 patients indicated no global efficacy. The number of days patients sustained PMS symptoms was reduced slightly from 7.5 to 6. Resting levels of blood prolactin remained within the physiological range throughout. No differences were seen between patients on or off oral contraceptives. 20 patients reported 37 adverse events (AE). No serious AE were reported. One patint withdrew after four days of treatment due to fatigue and headache. Laboratory safety control parameters were not affected. In conclusion, patients with PMS can be treated successfully with Vitex agnus-castus extract Ze 440, as indicated by clear improvement in the main effect parameter during treatment and the gradual return after cessation of treatment. The main response to treatment seems related to symptomatic relief rather than to the duration of the syndrome.","A prospective, open-label study of chasteberry tree for PMS symptoms in 43 patients found a 42% decrease in self-assessed PMS symptom scores, with the greatest improvement in pain, behavior changes, negative feelings, and fluid retention. No serious adverse events occurred."
"Do any folk remedies or herbals help induce labor
Evening primrose oil is widely used by many midwives to hasten cervical ripening in an effort to shorten labor and decrease the incidence of postdates pregnancies. Although its efficacy has been studied in the relief of symptoms of a number of medical conditions, its use has not been well studied, if at all, for the purpose of cervical ripening. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of oral evening primrose oil on the length of pregnancy and selected intrapartum outcomes in low-risk nulliparous women. A two group retrospective quasi-experimental design conducted on a sample of women who received care in a birth center, compared selected outcomes of 54 women taking evening primrose oil in their pregnancy with a control group of 54 women who did not. Findings suggest that the oral administration of evening primrose oil from the 37th gestational week until birth does not shorten gestation or decrease the overall length of labor. Further, the use of orally administered evening primrose oil may be associated with an increase in the incidence of prolonged rupture of membranes, oxytocin augmentation, arrest of descent, and vacuum extraction.","A retrospective cohort study compared pregnancy outcomes in 54 women who took evening primrose oil (500 mg 3 times a day beginning at 37 weeks) with a matched group of 54 women who did not take it. The study found no significant differences between the groups in maternal age, Apgar scores, or days of gestation. However, the women taking evening primrose oil tended to have protracted active phase of labor, prolonged rupture of membranes, arrest of descent, and oxytocin augmentation (none of which were statistically significant)."
"What is the most effective beta-blocker for heart failure
Both metoprolol and carvedilol produce hemodynamic and clinical benefits in patients with chronic heart failure; carvedilol exerts greater antiadrenergic effects than metoprolol, but it is unknown whether this pharmacological difference results in hemodynamic and clinical differences between the 2 drugs. We randomized 150 patients with heart failure (left ventricular ejection fraction </=0.35) to double-blind treatment with either metoprolol or carvedilol. When compared with metoprolol (124+/-55 mg/d), patients treated with carvedilol (49+/-18 mg/d) showed larger increases in left ventricular ejection fraction at rest (+10.9+/-11.0 versus +7.2+/-7.7 U, P=0.038) and in left ventricular stroke volume and stroke work during exercise (both P<0. 05) after 13 to 15 months of treatment. In addition, carvedilol produced greater decreases in mean pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary wedge pressure, both at rest and during exercise, than metoprolol (all P<0.05). In contrast, the metoprolol group showed greater increases in maximal exercise capacity than the carvedilol group (P=0.035), but the 2 drugs improved symptoms, submaximal exercise tolerance, and quality of life to a similar degree. After a mean of 23+/-11 months of follow-up, 21 patients in the metoprolol group and 17 patients in the carvedilol group died or underwent urgent transplantation. The present study demonstrates that during long-term therapy, carvedilol improves cardiac performance to a greater extent than metoprolol when administered to patients with heart failure in the doses shown to be effective in clinical trials. These differences were likely related to a greater antiadrenergic activity of carvedilol.",A large randomized controlled trial compared carvedilol and metoprolol head-to-head. It included 150 subjects with ejection fractions below 35% who were randomized to 1 of the 2 drugs and followed for more than 3 years. Symptom scores and quality of life assessments were similar in the 2 groups. A trend toward lower mortality in the carvedilol group did not reach statistical significance. Peak oxygen uptake during exercise was greater in the metoprolol group. The carvedilol group had a statistically greater improvement in ejection fraction (+10.9 ± 11.0 vs +7.2 ± 7.7 at rest).
"Does reducing smoking in the home protect children from the effects of second-hand smoke
Exposure to secondhand smoke (SHS) harms all children's health, especially children with asthma. Yet, children with asthma are as likely to live with smokers as healthy children. Household smoking bans are being advocated to reduce children's harm from SHS. To measure the effect of household smoking bans on child SHS exposure and to examine correlates of strict smoking bans in a low-income, diverse sample, 91 children with asthma were matched to 91 healthy children. All had at least one smoker living in their homes. Nicotine dosimeters, child cotinine assays, and maternal reports quantified child SHS exposures. Maternal reports of household smoking rules, behaviors, and beliefs, and other family characteristics were also gathered. The presence of a strict household smoking ban vastly reduced children's SHS exposures and was associated with fewer cigarettes smoked by the mother and by other family members, the belief that SHS was a personal health risk, having children with asthma, and living in a single-family home. Many children are exposed to high levels of SHS at home. Strict household smoking bans greatly decrease, but do not eliminate children's SHS exposure. Even in disadvantaged families, mutable factors were associated with strict smoking bans. Increased dissemination and use of established public health strategies are needed to reduce children's SHS exposures.","A case-control study that recruited families with asthmatic and nonasthmatic children assessed the effectiveness of parental behaviors to reduce second-hand smoke in 182 households with 1 smoking parent and a child between 6 and 12 years of age. Researchers measured room air nicotine and salivary cotinine concentrations. The nicotine levels on children's belts and in their bedrooms and the family room were approximately 3 log units lower in houses with strict smoking bans compared with households with any degree of indoor smoking (P<.0001). Similarly, salivary cotinine levels were approximately 4 log units lower in children of households with indoor smoking bans (P<.0001)."
"Do topical antibiotics improve wound healing
To determine differences in infection rates among uncomplicated, repaired wounds managed with: topical bacitracin zinc (BAC); neomycin sulfate, bacitracin zinc, and polymyxin B sulfate combination (NEO); silver sulfadiazine (SIL); and petrolatum (PTR). This was a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted at a military community hospital with an emergency medicine residency program. Patients were enrolled if they: presented to the ED within 12 hours of injury and did not have puncture wounds, allergies to the agents used, or a history of immunocompromise; were not receiving antibiotics, chemotherapy, or steroids at the time of presentation; had not taken antibiotics within the preceding seven days; did not have an underlying fracture; and were not pregnant as determined by history. Local anesthetics without epinephrine and high-pressure irrigation with normal saline were used for all patients. Wound scrubbing, débridement, and polyglactin subcutaneous (SQ) suture placement were carried out when necessary. Interrupted simple sutures using a monofilament, nonabsorbable material were used for skin closure. Numbered, randomized vials were given to all patients, with standardized instructions to inspect, clean, and redress their wounds three times a day. The wounds were evaluated for clinical infection at the time of follow-up. Among the groups, there was no difference in patient ages; gender; wound location, type, length, or depth; time elapsed from injury to ED treatment; number of wounds scrubbed or necessitating débridement; number of SQ and cutaneous sutures used; and rate of compliance with returning the used vial of dispensed topical agent. The wound infection rates for the treatment groups were: BAC, six of 109 (5.5%); NEO, five of 110 (4.5%); SIL, 12 of 99 (12.1%); and PTR, 19 of 108 (17.6%) (p = 0.0034). The use of topical antibiotics resulted in significantly lower infection rates than did the use of a petrolatum control. BAC and NEO had the lowest wound infection rates.","Topical bacitracin zinc (Bacitracin), a triple ointment of neomycin sulfate, bacitracin zinc, and polymyxin B sulfate (Neosporin), and silver sulfadiazine (Silvadene) were compared with petrolatum as a control in a well-conducted randomized controlled trials of 426 patients with uncomplicated wounds seen at a military community hospital. Wound infection rates were 17.6% (19/108) for petrolatum, 5.5% (6/109) for Bacitracin (number needed to treat [NNT]=8), 4.5% (5/110) for Neosporin (NNT=8), and 12.1% (12/99) for Silvadene (NNT=18). Most (60%) of the infections were ""stitch abscesses"" and were treated with local care only. There was no difference in rates of more serious infections between groups. One patient (0.9%) developed a hypersensitivity reaction to Neosporin."
"Is the ThinPrep better than conventional Pap smear at detecting cervical cancer
To evaluate the accuracy of conventional and new methods of Papanicolaou (Pap) testing when used to detect cervical cancer and its precursors. Systematic search of English-language literature through October 1999 using MEDLINE, EMBASE, other computerized databases, and hand searching. All studies that compared Pap testing (conventional methods, computer screening or rescreening, or monolayer cytology) with a concurrent reference standard (histologic examination, colposcopy, or cytology). Two reviewers independently reviewed selection criteria and completed 2 x 2 tables for each study. 94 studies of the conventional Pap test and three studies of monolayer cytology met inclusion criteria. No studies of computerized screening were included. Data were organized by cytologic and histologic thresholds used to define disease. For conventional Pap tests, estimates of sensitivity and specificity varied greatly in individual studies. Methodologic quality and frequency of histologic abnormalities also varied greatly between studies. In the 12 studies with the least biased estimates, sensitivity ranged from 30% to 87% and specificity ranged from 86% to 100%. Insufficient high-quality data exist to estimate test operating characteristics of new cytologic methods for cervical screening. Future studies of these technologies should apply adequate reference standards. Most studies of the conventional Pap test are severely biased: The best estimates suggest that it is only moderately accurate and does not achieve concurrently high sensitivity and specificity. Cost-effectiveness models of cervical cancer screening should use more conservative estimates of Pap test sensitivity.",A review found insufficient evidence to even judge the new test.
"Which patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) should have esophagogastroduoudenoscopy (EGD)
The causes of adenocarcinomas of the esophagus and gastric cardia are poorly understood. We conducted an epidemiologic investigation of the possible association between gastroesophageal reflux and these tumors. We performed a nationwide, population-based, case-control study in Sweden. Case ascertainment was rapid, and all cases were classified uniformly. Information on the subjects' history of gastroesophageal reflux was collected in personal interviews. The odds ratios were calculated by logistic regression, with multivariate adjustment for potentially confounding variables. Of the patients interviewed, the 189 with esophageal adenocarcinoma and the 262 with adenocarcinoma of the cardia constituted 85 percent of the 529 patients in Sweden who were eligible for the study during the period from 1995 through 1997. For comparison, we interviewed 820 control subjects from the general population and 167 patients with esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma. Among persons with recurrent symptoms of reflux, as compared with persons without such symptoms, the odds ratios were 7.7 (95 percent confidence interval, 5.3 to 11.4) for esophageal adenocarcinoma and 2.0 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.4 to 2.9) for adenocarcinoma of the cardia. The more frequent, more severe, and longer-lasting the symptoms of reflux, the greater the risk. Among persons with long-standing and severe symptoms of reflux, the odds ratios were 43.5 (95 percent confidence interval, 18.3 to 103.5) for esophageal adenocarcinoma and 4.4 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.7 to 11.0) for adenocarcinoma of the cardia. The risk of esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma was not associated with reflux (odds ratio, 1.1; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.7 to 1.9). There is a strong and probably causal relation between gastroesophageal reflux and esophageal adenocarcinoma. The relation between reflux and adenocarcinoma of the gastric cardia is relatively weak.","A Swedish case-controlled study compared 189 cases of esophageal adenocarcinoma and 167 cases of squamous cell carcinoma with 820 control subjects recruited from the general population. Patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma were 7.7 times more likely to report symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease at least once weekly 5 years before their diagnosis with adenocarcinoma. Other ORs are as follows: symptoms once per week (5.1), symptoms more than 3 times per week (16.7), nocturnal symptoms at least once per week (10.8), and duration more than 20 years (16.4)."
"What is the best treatment for analgesic rebound headaches
Chronic migraine (CM) patients frequently overuse symptomatic medications (SM). These medications may create a cycle of rebound, worsening of headache and withdrawal symptoms that perpetuate the headache itself. In addition, the overuse of such substances is believed to counteract the efficacy of preventive treatments. We conducted a prospective randomized open-label trial comparing approaches to out-patient management in 150 CM patients (125 women, 25 men; ages 18-80 years, mean 40.3 +/- 13.8) with overuse of SM. In each group, 50 patients received education and orientation and were then abruptly withdrawn from all SM. Immediately following withdrawal, the first group took prednisone (60 mg/ day 2 days, 40 mg/day 2 days and 20 mg/day 2 days) for 6 days, the second group did not have any regular medications to take and the third group took naratriptan (2.5 mg twice a day) during this initial period. All patients had similar profiles of headache characteristics and consumption (quality and quantity) of SM before initiation of the treatment, but most were not severe headache sufferers, heavy SM overusers or were overusing opioids. After 5 weeks the headache frequency and intensity, the prevalence and frequency of withdrawal symptoms and consumption of rescue medications during the first 6 days were compared between groups. In addition, adherence to treatment (who returned or not and for which reasons, between groups) and headache frequency, week by week, among the groups of patients were also compared. Forty-four (88%) patients from the prednisone group, 41 (82%) from the 'nothing' group and 35 (70%) from the naratriptan group adhered to the treatment and returned. The were no differences between groups with regard to treatment adherence (P = 0.072), headache frequency as well as intensity (P = 0.311) and decreasing of days with headache after 5 weeks and weekly (P = 0.275). However, the incidence of withdrawal symptoms and consumption of rescue drugs was higher among the patients who did not take regular medications during the first 6 days (P = 0.0001 and P = 0.006). We concluded that CM patients with moderate overuse of SM other than opioids may be detoxified on an out-patient basis regardless of the strategy adopted with regard to the use of regular drugs during the initial days of withdrawal, but prednisone and naratriptan may be useful for reducing withdrawal symptoms and rescue medication consumption. Further controlled studies are necessary to confirm these observations.","An open-label trial of patients with chronic migraine and analgesic overuse in a headache sub-specialty center abruptly withdrew 150 participants from analgesics and quasi-randomized them to 3 groups: prednisone (tapering from 60 to 20 mg over 6 days), naratriptan (Amerge) (2.5 mg twice daily for 6 days), or no prophylactic treatment. Patients given the active substances were told it would reduce withdrawal symptoms; patients given placebo were not given this advice. All patients received education about the pathophysiology of rebound headaches, kept a headache diary, and were phoned weekly to ensure compliance. In addition, they all received capsules containing gradually increasing doses of atenolol, nortriptyline, and flunarazine (a calcium channel blocker not FDA-approved.) Indo-methacin and chlorpromazine were used as needed. Results from the first 6 days showed no difference in headaches between the 3 groups; however, significantly more patients used chlorpromazine in the ""no pharmacologic treatment"" group. By the end of 5 weeks, headache frequency was significantly reduced in all groups from baseline; however, there were no differences between groups in headache frequency or intensity in this small study. Of note, there were statistically fewer withdrawal symptoms and less use of rescue medications among patients who received the initial prophylactic treatments. The indomethacin rescue use was 24%, 18%, and 14% of patients for the no prophylactic treatment, prednisone, and naratriptan groups respectively, while chlorpromazine rescue use was 14%, 0%, and 0%, respectively. The number of patients needed to treat to prevent any withdrawal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, nervousness, dizziness, etc.) was 1 for every 3.5 for naratriptan, and 6.4 for prednisone."
"Do insulin-sensitizing drugs increase ovulation rates for women with PCOS
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is characterized by hyperandrogenism, chronic anovulation, and insulin resistance; long-term consequences include diabetes mellitus type 2. The aim of this randomized, double-blind, controlled trial was to investigate whether the thiazolidinedione derivative pioglitazone diminishes insulin resistance and hyperandrogenism and enhances ovulation rates in women with PCOS. Forty premenopausal women with PCOS were randomly allocated to treatment with either pioglitazone (30 mg/d) or placebo for periods of 3 months. Administration of pioglitazone resulted in a remarkable decline in both fasting serum insulin levels (P < 0.02) and the area under the insulin response curve after an oral glucose load (P < 0.02). This represented an increase in insulin sensitivity and a decrease in insulin secretion (P < 0.05). Furthermore, pioglitazone increased serum SHBG (P < 0.05), resulting in a significant decrease in the free androgen index (P < 0.05 compared with placebo). Treatment with pioglitazone was also associated with higher ovulation rates (P < 0.02). Thus, pioglitazone significantly improved insulin sensitivity, hyperandrogenism, and ovulation rates in women with PCOS, thereby providing both metabolic and reproductive benefits.","Troglitazone has been taken off of the market due to hepatotoxicity, but results from a randomized controlled trials of 40 patients with PCOS reported that the use of pioglitazone (Actos) for 3 months increased normal regular cycles and ovulations over placebo (41.2% vs 5.6%; P<.02). No liver effects were noted, but caution must be taken since these drugs are pregnancy class C."
"Do endovascular filters prevent pulmonary embolism  as effectively as anticoagulants in patients with deep venous thrombosis
To review a 26-year single-center clinical experience with inferior vena caval filters. During 1973-1998, 1,765 filters were implanted in 1,731 patients. Hospital files were reviewed, and data were collected about the indications, safety, effectiveness, numbers, and types of caval filters. Fatal post-filter pulmonary embolism (PE) was considered the primary outcome. Morbidity and mortality were determined as secondary outcomes. Survival and morbidity-free survival curves were calculated. The prevalence of observed post-filter PE was 5.6%. It was fatal in 3.7% of patients. In most patients, fatal PE occurred soon after filter insertion (median, 4.0 days; 95% CI: 2.2, 5.8 days). Major complications occurred in 0.3% of procedures. The prevalence of observed post-filter caval thrombosis was 2.7%. The 30-day mortality rate was 17.0% overall, higher among patients with neoplasms (19.5%) as compared with those without neoplasms (14.3%; P =.004). Filter efficacy and associated morbidity were not different in 46 patients with suprarenal filters. The rate of filters placed for prophylaxis was 4.7% overall and increased to 16.4% in 1998. From 1980 to 1996, there was a fivefold increase in the number of caval filter implants. In recent years, more filters were implanted in younger patients. Inferior vena caval filters provide protection from life-threatening PE, with minimal morbidity.",A single-center retrospective cohort study of 1731 patients with IVCFs placed for various indications showed pulmonary embolism  in 5.6% of patients. Some embolisms were clinically suspected and not confirmed.
"What is the best treatment for gastroesophageal reflux and vomiting in infants
To assess the efficacy of omeprazole in treating irritable infants with gastroesophageal reflux and/or esophagitis. Irritable infants (n=30) 3 to 12 months of age met the entry criteria of esophageal acid exposure >5% (n=22) and/or abnormal esophageal histology (n=15). They completed a 4-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial of omeprazole. Cry/fuss diary (minutes/24 hours) and a visual analogue scale of infant irritability as judged by parental impression were obtained at baseline and the end of each 2-week treatment period. The reflux index fell significantly during omeprazole treatment compared with placebo (-8.9%+/-5.6%, -1.9%+/-2.0%, P<.001). Cry/fuss time decreased from baseline (267+/-119), regardless of treatment sequence (period 1, 203+/-99, P<.04; period 2, 188+/-121, P<.008). Visual analogue score decreased from baseline to period 2 (6.8+/-1.6, 4.8+/-2.9, P=.008). There was no significant difference for both outcome measures while taking either omeprazole or placebo. Compared with placebo, omeprazole significantly reduced esophageal acid exposure but not irritability. Irritability improved with time, regardless of treatment.","A small randomized controlled trials of omeprazole shows significant improvement in reflux index measured by pH probe. However, the study resulted in no differences in ""cry-fuss time"" between treatment groups."
"What is the best management for patients with evidence of asymptomatic ischemia on exercise stress testing
Exercise testing in asymptomatic persons has been criticized for failing to accurately predict those at risk for coronary heart disease (CHD). Previous studies on asymptomatic subjects, however, may not have been large enough or long enough to provide reliable outcome measures. This study examines the ability of a maximal exercise test to predict death from CHD and death from any cause in a population of asymptomatic men. This is a prospective longitudinal study performed between 1970 and 1989, with an average follow-up of 8.4 years. The subjects are 25,927 healthy men, 20 to 82 years of age at baseline (mean 42.9 years) who were free of cardiovascular disease and who were evaluated in a preventive medicine clinic. The main outcome measures are CHD mortality and all-cause mortality. During follow-up there were 612 deaths from all causes and 158 deaths from CHD. The sensitivity of an abnormal exercise test to predict coronary death was 61%. The age-adjusted relative risk of an abnormal exercise test for CHD death was 21 (6.9 to 63.3) in those with no risk factors, 27 (10.7 to 68.8) in those with 1 risk factor, 54 (21.5 to 133.7) in those with 2 risk factors, and 80 (30.0 to 212. 5) in those with >/=3 factors. A maximal exercise test performed in asymptomatic men free of cardiovascular disease does appear to be a worthwhile tool in predicting future risk of CHD death. An abnormal exercise test is a more powerful predictor of risk in those with than without conventional risk factors.","Among 25,927 healthy men followed for an average of 8.4 years, the age-adjusted risk of death from all causes of those with asymptomatic ischemia increased from 2-fold (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1-3.8, P=.03) with no risk factors to 4 (95% CI, 2.7-5.4) with 1 risk factor, 5 (95% CI, 3.3-6.9) with 2 risk factors, and 8 (95% CI, 5.4-12.8) with 3 or more risk factors (P<.0001)."

The purpose of this study is to present the role of ultrasonography and MRI in the investigation of testicular and penile masses, as well as to review the literature. This article is based on our experience with 230 patients who presented with acute or subacute scrotal pain or painless enlargement of the scrotum or penis. Gray scale and color Doppler ultrasonography (CDU) were applied in all cases. In 73 cases, the final diagnosis was established by surgery and in 157 cases by follow-up. MRI was performed in 48 cases. Ultrasonography was the initial imaging modality in all cases. It provided detailed anatomic information with high sensitivity and accuracy in cases of torsion, inflammation, varicocele and trauma. In cases of tumor, US showed the presence of the mass in all cases, while it additionally revealed certain characteristic features of tissue constitution and blood supply. In most cases, differentiation between various types of tumors or differentiation between malignant and benign lesions was impossible. MRI, besides the detailed anatomic imaging, also provided a certain degree of tissue specificity. MRI could help in the detection and staging of penile cancer and in the evaluation of testicular and scrotal masses, especially when a diagnostic dilemma occurred on ultrasonographic examination. Ultrasonography, combining gray scale and color techniques, is irreplaceable in the diagnostic work-up of scrotal and penile masses, while MRI can serve as a problem solving diagnostic modality.","In a study, which used surgery as the diagnostic gold standard, color Doppler ultrasound had a sensitivity of 93.5% for the diagnosis of testicular torsion."
"Which strategies work best to prevent obesity in adults
In the past, interventions aimed at reducing obesity have mainly targeted at weight loss treatment in obese adults, with limited long-term effects. With the increasing number of people being obese and being at risk for obesity, there has been a shift in focus towards prevention of obesity. We conducted a systematic review of the peer-reviewed literature on the efficacy of obesity prevention interventions in adults in order to identify effective interventions and intervention elements. Pubmed, OVID, and Web of Science databases were searched from January 1996 to June 2006. Interventions aimed at primary prevention of weight gain among adults achieved by focusing on dietary intake, physical activity or the combination of both were included. The outcome measure had to be difference in change in body mass index or body weight between the intervention and the control groups. Nine studies were included, five long-term studies (at least 1 year) and four short-term (3 months to 1 year). Seven studies evaluated an intervention that focused on a combination of diet and physical activity to prevent weight gain, one on diet only and one on physical activity only. One dietary intervention (long-term), and three combined dietary and physical activity interventions (one long-term and two short-term) produced significantly positive results at end of follow-up. The two long-term, effective interventions consisted of intensive and long-term intervention implementation, including groups sessions designed to promote behavioural changes. The current evidence of efficacy of obesity prevention interventions is based on a very small number of studies. Some studies showed a positive impact on body mass index or weight status, but there was too much heterogeneity in terms of study design, theoretical underpinning and target population to draw firm conclusions about which intervention approaches are more effective than others. More research is urgently needed to extend the body of evidence.","A systematic review of obesity prevention studies found 9 RCTs demonstrating that dietary and physical activity interventions can prevent weight gain, but lacking sufficient evidence to recommend a specific type of program."
"Which healthy adults should take aspirin
The Physicians' Health Study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial designed to determine whether low-dose aspirin (325 mg every other day) decreases cardiovascular mortality and whether beta carotene reduces the incidence of cancer. The aspirin component was terminated earlier than scheduled, and the preliminary findings were published. We now present detailed analyses of the cardiovascular component for 22,071 participants, at an average follow-up time of 60.2 months. There was a 44 percent reduction in the risk of myocardial infarction (relative risk, 0.56; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.45 to 0.70; P less than 0.00001) in the aspirin group (254.8 per 100,000 per year as compared with 439.7 in the placebo group). A slightly increased risk of stroke among those taking aspirin was not statistically significant; this trend was observed primarily in the subgroup with hemorrhagic stroke (relative risk, 2.14; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.96 to 4.77; P = 0.06). No reduction in mortality from all cardiovascular causes was associated with aspirin (relative risk, 0.96; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.60 to 1.54). Further analyses showed that the reduction in the risk of myocardial infarction was apparent only among those who were 50 years of age and older. The benefit was present at all levels of cholesterol, but appeared greatest at low levels. The relative risk of ulcer in the aspirin group was 1.22 (169 in the aspirin group as compared with 138 in the placebo group; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.98 to 1.53; P = 0.08), and the relative risk of requiring a blood transfusion was 1.71. This trial of aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease demonstrates a conclusive reduction in the risk of myocardial infarction, but the evidence concerning stroke and total cardiovascular deaths remains inconclusive because of the inadequate numbers of physicians with these end points.","Results from 1 study did achieve statistical significance (OR=0.64; 95% CI, 0.42-0.99). No differences were found between aspirin-treated and control groups for all-cause mortality or ischemic stroke reduction."
"Which lifestyle interventions effectively lower low density lipoprotein cholesterol
To evaluate the effects on blood pressure, lipid profile, and anxiety status on subjects received a 12-week Tai Chi Chuan exercise program. Randomized controlled study of a Tai Chi Chuan group and a group of sedentary life controls. Taipei Medical University Hospitals and University campus in the Taipei, Taiwan, area. Two (2) selected groups of 76 healthy subjects with blood pressure at high-normal or stage I hypertension. A 12-week Tai Chi Chuan exercise training program was practiced regularly with a frequency of 3 times per week. Each session included 10-minute warm-up, 30-minute Tai Chi exercise, 10-minute cool-down. Exercise intensity was estimated to be approximately 64% of maximal heart rate. Blood pressure, lipid profile and anxiety status (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory; STAI) were evaluated. After 12-weeks of Tai Chi training, the treatment group showed significant decrease in systolic blood pressure of 15.6 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure 8.8 mm Hg. The serum total cholesterol level decreased 15.2 mg/dL and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol increased 4.7 mg/dL. By using STAI evaluation, both trait anxiety and state anxiety were decreased. This study shows that under well-designed conditions, Tai Chi exercise training could decrease blood pressure and results in favorable lipid profile changes and improve subjects' anxiety status. Therefore, Tai Chi could be used as an alternative modality in treating patients with mild hypertension, with a promising economic effect.","Two RCTs investigated the effect of meditation on LDL-C with mixed results. One (N=16) showed a significant decrease in LDL-C over 8 weeks, while a second (N=60) showed no difference in LDL-C. A high-quality randomized controlled trials (N=91) with a combined intervention (counseling, exercise, and meditation over 1 year) showed a significant decrease in LDL-C."
"Should we screen for ovarian cancer
To estimate the performance of currently available tests in detecting ovarian cancer in asymptomatic women. Systematic review of prospective screening studies. Twenty-five studies were identified: sixteen studied women at average risk and nine studied women at higher risk. Most studies evaluated only one screening method, were small, detecting few cancers, and gave few follow up details. Sensitivity estimates are therefore imprecise. In a typical larger study, reported sensitivity of ultrasound screening at one year was around 100% (95% CI 54%-100%), while the sensitivity of CA125 measurement followed by ultrasound (multimodal screening) was about 80% (95% CI 49%-95%). False positive rates ranged between 1.2% and 2.5% for grey scale ultrasound, between 0.3% and 0.7% for ultrasound with colour Doppler and between 0.1% and 0.6% for multimodal screening. This implies that, in annual screening of a population with an incidence of 40 per 100,000, and if no cancers were missed, between 2.5 and 60 women would undergo surgery for every primary ovarian cancer detected. Ultrasound and multimodal screening can detect ovarian cancer in asymptomatic women, but there is currently no evidence on whether screening improves outcome for women in any risk group. On-going randomised controlled trials should establish the magnitude of any benefit of screening. The low prevalence of ovarian cancer in the population, and its rate of progression, may limit the potential cost-effectiveness of screening.","There is indirect evidence that early detection prolongs survival, as well as evidence that screening results in an increase in diagnosing a tumor at stage 1."
"What best prevents exerciseinduced bronchoconstriction for a child with asthma
In 1997, the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP), coordinated by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, published the second Expert Panel Report (EPR-2): Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma (National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Asthma Education and Prevention Program. Expert Panel Report 2: Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of asthma. Bethesda MD: US Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, 1997; publication no. 97-4051. Available at http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/guidelines/ asthma/asthgdln.pdf). Subsequently, the NAEPP Expert Panel identified key questions regarding asthma management that were submitted to an evidence practice center of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality to conduct a systematic review of the evidence. The resulting evidence report was used by the Expert Panel to update recommendations for clinical practice on selected topics. These recommendations (EPR-Update 2002) were published in 2002. (National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Asthma Education and Prevention Program. Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of asthma--update on selected topics 2002. J Allergy Clin Immunol 2002;110[November 2002, part 2]. Available at http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/guidelines/asthma/index.htm). To improve the implementation of these guidelines, a working group of the Professional Education Subcommittee of the NAEPP extracted key clinical activities that should be considered as essential for quality asthma care in accordance with the EPR-2 guidelines and the EPR-Update 2002. The purpose was to develop a report that would help purchasers and planners of health care define the activities that are important to quality asthma care, particularly in reducing symptoms and preventing exacerbations, and subsequently reducing the overall national burden of illness and death from asthma. This report is intended to help employer health benefits managers and other health-care planners make decisions regarding delivery of health care for persons with asthma. Although this report is based on information directed to clinicians; it is not intended to substitute for recommended clinical practices for caring for persons with asthma, nor is it intended to replace the clinical decision-making required to meet individual patient needs. Readers are referred to the EPR-2 for the full asthma guidelines regarding diagnosis and management of asthma or to the abstracted Practical Guide (National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Asthma Education and Prevention Program.

The 1997 EPR-2 guidelines and EPR-Update 2002 were derived from a consensus of leading asthma researchers from academic, clinical, federal and voluntary institutions and based on scientific evidence supported by the literature. The 10 key activities highlighted here correspond to the four recommended-as-essential components of asthma management: assessment and monitoring, control of factors contributing to asthma severity, pharmacotherapy and education for a partnership in care. The key clinical activities are not intended for acute or hospital management of patients with asthma but rather for the preventive aspects of managing asthma long term. This report was developed as a collaborative activity between CDC and the NAEPP.","The National Asthma Education and Prevention Program recommends prevention of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction by optimally controlling underlying asthma. If a patient remains symptomatic during exercise, you should review medication usage, understanding of dosage instructions, and administration technique before any changes in the treatment regimen."
"Do any folk remedies or herbals help induce labor
The role of prostaglandins for cervical ripening and induction of labour has been examined extensively. Human semen is the biological source that is presumed to contain the highest prostaglandin concentration. The role of sexual intercourse in the initiation of labour is uncertain. The action of sexual intercourse in stimulating labour is unclear, it may in part be due to the physical stimulation of the lower uterine segment, or endogenous release of oxytocin as a result of orgasm or from the direct action of prostaglandins in semen. Furthermore nipple stimulation may be part of the process of initiation. This is one of a series of reviews of methods of cervical ripening and labour induction using standardised methodology. To determine the effects of sexual intercourse for third trimester cervical ripening or induction of labour in comparison with other methods of induction. The Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group trials register, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register and bibliographies of relevant papers. Last searched: November 2000. (1) clinical trials comparing sexual intercourse for third trimester cervical ripening or labour induction with placebo/no treatment or other methods listed above it on a predefined list of labour induction methods; (2) random allocation to the treatment or control group; (3) adequate allocation concealment; (4) violations of allocated management not sufficient to materially affect conclusions; (5) clinically meaningful outcome measures reported; (6) data available for analysis according to the random allocation; (7) missing data insufficient to materially affect the conclusion. A strategy has been developed to deal with the large volume and complexity of trial data relating to labour induction. This involves a two-stage method of data extraction. There was one included study of 28 women which reported very limited data, from which no meaningful conclusions can be drawn. The role of sexual intercourse as a method of induction of labour is uncertain. Any future trials investigating sexual intercourse as a method of induction need to be of sufficient power to detect clinically relevant differences in standard outcomes. However, it may prove difficult to standardise sexual intercourse as an intervention to allow meaningful comparisons with other methods of induction of labour.","A Cochrane systematic review found 1 observational study of the effect of sexual intercourse on cervical ripening and induction of labor among 28 women at term. The study evaluated cervical Bishop scores after sexual intercourse with intravaginal semen deposition for 3 consecutive nights compared with no intercourse. The difference in Bishop score was not significant (1.0 with coitus vs 0.5 controls; P>.05) and no difference in the number of women who delivered within 3 days was noted in the 2 groups (RR=0.99; 95% CI, 0.45-2.20)."
"What is the best strategy for impaired glucose tolerance in nonpregnant adults
Type 2 diabetes affects approximately 8 percent of adults in the United States. Some risk factors--elevated plasma glucose concentrations in the fasting state and after an oral glucose load, overweight, and a sedentary lifestyle--are potentially reversible. We hypothesized that modifying these factors with a lifestyle-intervention program or the administration of metformin would prevent or delay the development of diabetes. We randomly assigned 3234 nondiabetic persons with elevated fasting and post-load plasma glucose concentrations to placebo, metformin (850 mg twice daily), or a lifestyle-modification program with the goals of at least a 7 percent weight loss and at least 150 minutes of physical activity per week. The mean age of the participants was 51 years, and the mean body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 34.0; 68 percent were women, and 45 percent were members of minority groups. The average follow-up was 2.8 years. The incidence of diabetes was 11.0, 7.8, and 4.8 cases per 100 person-years in the placebo, metformin, and lifestyle groups, respectively. The lifestyle intervention reduced the incidence by 58 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 48 to 66 percent) and metformin by 31 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 17 to 43 percent), as compared with placebo; the lifestyle intervention was significantly more effective than metformin. To prevent one case of diabetes during a period of three years, 6.9 persons would have to participate in the lifestyle-intervention program, and 13.9 would have to receive metformin. Lifestyle changes and treatment with metformin both reduced the incidence of diabetes in persons at high risk. The lifestyle intervention was more effective than metformin.","In the placebo-controlled diabetes prevention program trial, metformin use was associated with a reduction in progression to diabetes mellitus (NNT=14)."
"What treatment works best for tennis elbow
Patients with lateral epicondylitis (tennis elbow) are frequently treated with corticosteroid injections, in order to relieve pain and diminish disability. The objective of this review was to evaluate the effectiveness of corticosteroid injections for lateral epicondylitis. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were identified by a highly sensitive search strategy in six databases in combination with reference tracking. Two independent reviewers selected and assessed the methodological quality of RCTs that included patients with lateral epicondylitis treated with corticosteroid injection(s), and reported at least one clinically relevant outcome measure. Standardised mean differences were computed for continuous data and relative risks (RR) for dichotomous data. A best-evidence synthesis was conducted, weighting the studies with respect to their internal validity, statistical significance, clinical relevance, and statistical power. Thirteen studies consisting of 15 comparisons were included in the review, evaluating the effects of corticosteroid injections compared to placebo injection (n=2), injection with local anaesthetic (n=5), another conservative treatment (n=5), or another corticosteroid injection (n=3). Almost all studies had poor internal validity scores. For short-term outcomes (<or=6 weeks), statistically significant and clinically relevant differences were found on pain, global improvement and grip strength for corticosteroid injection compared to placebo, local anaesthetic and conservative treatments. For intermediate (6 weeks-6 months) and long-term outcomes (>or=6 months), no statistically significant or clinically relevant results in favour of corticosteroid injections were found. Although the available evidence shows superior short-term effects of corticosteroid injections for lateral epicondylitis, it is not possible to draw firm conclusions on the effectiveness of injections, due to the lack of high quality studies. No beneficial effects were found for intermediate or long-term follow-up. More, better designed, conducted and reported RCTs with intermediate and long-term follow-up are needed.","A subanalysis of 4 studies in another systematic review found corticosteroid injections to be superior to other conservative treatments such as elbow supports, oral NSAIDs, and physiotherapy at 2 to 6 weeks (RR=0.50; 95% CI, 0.36-0.70). The positive effects were not maintained at 6 weeks."
"What's the best way to manage athletes with amenorrhea
Exercise-induced or athletic menstrual dysfunction (amenorrhoea, oligomenorrhoea, anovulation, luteal phase deficiency, delayed menarche) is more common in active women and can significantly affect health and sport performance. Although athletic amenorrhoea represents the most extreme form of menstrual dysfunction, other forms can also result in suppressed estrogen levels and affect bone health and fertility. A number of factors, such as energy balance, exercise intensity and training practices, bodyweight and composition, disordered eating behaviours, and physical and emotional stress levels, may contribute to the development of athletic menstrual dysfunction. There also appears to be a high degree of individual variation with respect to the susceptibility of the reproductive axis to exercise and diet-related stresses. The dietary issues of the female athlete with athletic menstrual dysfunction are similar to those of her eumenorrhoeic counterpart. The most common nutrition issues in active women are poor energy intake and/or poor food selection, which can lead to poor intakes of protein, carbohydrate and essential fatty acids. The most common micronutrients to be low are the bone-building nutrients, especially calcium, the B vitamins, iron and zinc. If energy drain is the primary contributing factor to athletic menstrual dysfunction, improved energy balance will improve overall nutritional status and may reverse the menstrual dysfunction, thus returning the athlete to normal reproductive function. Because bone health can be compromised in female athletes with menstrual dysfunction, intakes of bone-building nutrients are especially important. Iron and zinc are typically low in the diets of female athletes if meat products are avoided. Adequate intake of the B vitamins is also important to ensure adequate energy production and the building and repair of muscle tissue. This review briefly discusses the various factors that may affect athletic menstrual dysfunction and two of the proposed mechanisms: the energy-drain and exercise-intensity hypotheses. Because energy drain can be a primary contributor to athletic menstrual dysfunction, recommendations for energy and the macro- and micronutrients are reviewed. Methods for helping the female athlete to reverse athletic menstrual dysfunction are discussed. The health consequences of trying to restrict energy intake too dramatically while training are also reviewed, as is the importance of screening athletes for disordered eating. Vitamins and minerals of greatest concern for the female athlete are addressed and recommendations for intake are given.","A 2002 review similarly recommends 1 rest day per week, increasing caloric intake by 200 to 300 Kcal/d, and increasing intake of calcium, B vitamins, iron, and zinc."
"At what age do patients no longer need colorectal cancer screening
There is growing evidence that faecal-occult-blood (FOB) screening may reduce colorectal cancer (CRC) mortality, but this reduction in CRC mortality has not been shown in an unselected population-based randomised controlled trial. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of FOB screening on CRC mortality in such a setting. Between February, 1981, and January, 1991, 152,850 people aged 45-74 years who lived in the Nottingham area of the UK were recruited to our study. Participants were randomly allocated FOB screening (76,466) or no screening (controls; 76,384). Controls were not told about the study and received no intervention. Screening-group participants were sent a Haemoccult FOB test kit with instructions from their family doctor. FOB tests were not rehydrated and dietary restrictions were imposed only for retesting borderline results. Individuals with negative FOB tests at the first screening, together with those who tested positive but in whom no neoplasia was found on colonoscopy, were invited to take part in further screening every 2 years. Screening was stopped in February, 1995, by which time screening-group participants had been offered FOB tests between three and six times. Screening-group participants who had a positive test were offered full colonoscopy. All participants were followed up until June, 1995. The primary outcome measure was CRC mortality. Of the 152,850 individuals recruited to the study, 2599 could not be traced or had emigrated and were excluded from the analysis. Thus, there were 75,253 participants in the screening group and 74,998 controls. 44,838 (59.6%) screening-group participants completed at least one screening. 28,720 (38.2%) of these individuals completed all the FOB tests they were offered and 16,118 (21.4%) completed at least one screening but not all the tests they were offered. 30,415 (40.4%) did not complete any test. Of 893 cancers (20% stage A) diagnosed in screening-group participants (CRC incidence of 1.49 per 1000 person-years), 236 (26.4%) were detected by FOB screening, 249 (27.9%) presented after a negative FOB test or investigation, and 400 (44.8%) presented in non-responders. The incidence of cancer in the control group (856 cases, 11% stage A) was 1.44 per 1000 person-years. Median follow-up was 7.8 years (range 4.5-14.5). 360 people died from CRC in the screening group compared with 420 in the control group-a 15% reduction in cumulative CRC mortality in the screening group (odds ratio=0.85 [95%; CI 0.74-0.98], p = 0.026). Our findings together with evidence from other trials suggest that consideration should be given to a national programme of FOB screening to reduce CRC mortality in the general population.",The upper age limits of patients was 74.
"How should we treat major depression combined with anxiety
This pilot study explored the efficacy and tolerability of extended-release venlafaxine (venlafaxine ER) in anxious and/or depressed patients with multisomatoform disorder (MSD). This 12-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind study evaluated adult primary care outpatients with MSD and comorbid major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, or social anxiety disorder (DSM-IV criteria). The intent-to-treat population included 112 patients (venlafaxine ER, N = 55; placebo, N = 57). The primary efficacy variable was the change in the 15-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-15) somatic symptom severity score. Secondary outcomes included the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D-17) and for Anxiety (HAM-A), Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness (CGI-S) and -Improvement (CGI-I) scales, McGill Quality of Life Questionnaire Physical Symptoms Scale (MQOL-PS), and Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form 36-Item questionnaire (MOS SF-36). Data were collected from April 2003 to December 2003. The decline by week 12 in PHQ-15 scores was significant (p < .0001) in both groups; however, the difference between the venlafaxine ER and placebo groups (-8.3 vs. -6.6, respectively) was not (p = .097). Improvement was greater with venlafaxine ER than placebo on the PHQ-15 pain subscale (p = .03), SF-36 bodily pain scale (26.1 vs. 14.5, p = .03), MQOL-PS (-11.7 vs. -6.0, p = .02), HAM-A psychic anxiety subscale (p = .02), SF-36 mental component summary (p = .03), time to response (54 vs. 71 days, p = .01), and CGI-I scale (p = .009). Venlafaxine ER was generally well tolerated. These results suggest that venlafaxine ER may be effective in relieving some types of somatic physical symptoms, particularly pain, in patients with depression and/or anxiety disorders.","Three trials evaluated antidepressant medication for patients who met diagnostic criteria for both major depression and generalized anxiety disorder. A manufacturer-sponsored randomized controlled trials (N=90) found no differences in HAM-A or HAM-D score reduction among fluoxetine, venlafaxine, and placebo (except at 12 weeks, when venlafaxine significantly differed from placebo)."
"Does group prenatal care improve pregnancy outcomes
To determine whether group prenatal care improves pregnancy outcomes, psychosocial function, and patient satisfaction and to examine potential cost differences. A multisite randomized controlled trial was conducted at two university-affiliated hospital prenatal clinics. Pregnant women aged 14-25 years (n=1,047) were randomly assigned to either standard or group care. Women with medical conditions requiring individualized care were excluded from randomization. Group participants received care in a group setting with women having the same expected delivery month. Timing and content of visits followed obstetric guidelines from week 18 through delivery. Each 2-hour prenatal care session included physical assessment, education and skills building, and support through facilitated group discussion. Structured interviews were conducted at study entry, during the third trimester, and postpartum. Mean age of participants was 20.4 years; 80% were African American. Using intent-to-treat analyses, women assigned to group care were significantly less likely to have preterm births compared with those in standard care: 9.8% compared with 13.8%, with no differences in age, parity, education, or income between study conditions. This is equivalent to a risk reduction of 33% (odds ratio 0.67, 95% confidence interval 0.44-0.99, P=.045), or 40 per 1,000 births. Effects were strengthened for African-American women: 10.0% compared with 15.8% (odds ratio 0.59, 95% confidence interval 0.38-0.92, P=.02). Women in group sessions were less likely to have suboptimal prenatal care (P<.01), had significantly better prenatal knowledge (P<.001), felt more ready for labor and delivery (P<.001), and had greater satisfaction with care (P<.001). Breastfeeding initiation was higher in group care: 66.5% compared with 54.6%, P<.001. There were no differences in birth weight nor in costs associated with prenatal care or delivery. Group prenatal care resulted in equal or improved perinatal outcomes at no added cost. ClinicalTrials.gov, www.clinicaltrials.gov, NCT00271960 I.","The randomized controlled trials showed increased knowledge and readiness for labor, and higher satisfaction compared with individual care (P<.001 for all outcomes)."
"What causes a low thyroid-stimulating hormone level with a normal free T4 level
There is recent evidence that both exogenous and endogenous subclinical thyrotoxicoses are associated with decreased bone mineral density. Scanty information is available on bone metabolism in these conditions when euthyroidism is restored. We evaluated the effect of anti-thyroid drug treatment on bone metabolism in endogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism. Prospective follow-up study over 2 years during treatment with methimazole, with an untreated control group. Sixteen post-menopausal women with endogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism associated with multinodular goitre, eight of whom were treated with methimazole. Serum concentrations of free T4, total T3, TSH, osteocalcin, urinary excretion of hydroxyproline and forearm bone mineral density were measured at regular intervals. Significant changes in serum osteocalcin concentration or urinary hydroxyproline excretion were not observed in either group. Distal, but not proximal, forearm bone mineral density, expressed as a percentage of the base-line value, was significantly (P < 0.05) higher in the treated than in the untreated subjects in the second year of treatment. Treatment with methimazole in post-menopausal women with endogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism associated with multinodular goitre can prevent excessive loss of bone, at least in the distal forearm.",One study of postmenopausal women with endogenous subclinical hypothyroidism (defined as thyroid-stimulating hormone <0.1 mIU/L) randomly assigned women to take methimazole (Tapazole) or placebo. Both groups were followed for 2 years and none received any medication with known effects on bone metabolism in the past or during the study period. The untreated patients with subclinical hypothyroidism had significantly higher bone mineral density loss (>5%) at both 18 and 24 months.
"For those intolerant to angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors and ARBs, what is the best therapy for reducing the risk of diabetic nephropathy
Dietary protein has long been thought to play a role in the progression of chronic renal disease, but clinical trials to date have not consistently shown that dietary protein restriction is beneficial. To use meta-analysis to assess the efficacy of dietary protein restriction in previously published studies of diabetic and nondiabetic renal diseases, including the recently completed Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study. The English-language medical literature published from January 1966 through December 1994 was searched for studies examining the effect of low-protein diets in humans with chronic renal disease. A total of 1413 patients in five studies on nondiabetic renal disease (mean length of follow-up, 18 to 36 months) and 108 patients in five studies of type I diabetes mellitus (mean length of follow-up, 9 to 35 months) were included. Randomized, controlled studies were selected for nondiabetic renal disease; randomized, controlled studies or time-controlled studies with nonrandomized crossover design were selected for diabetic nephropathy. Data in tables, figures, or text were independently extracted by two of the authors. The relative risk for progression of renal disease in patients receiving a low-protein diet compared with patients receiving a usual-protein diet was calculated by using a random-effects model. In five studies of nondiabetic renal disease, a low-protein diet significantly reduced the risk for renal failure or death (relative risk, 0.67 [95% Cl, 0.50 to 0.89]). In five studies of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, a low-protein diet significantly slowed the increase in urinary albumin level or the decline in glomerular filtration rate or creatinine clearance (relative risk, 0.56 [Cl, 0.40 to 0.77]). Tests for heterogeneity showed no significant differences in relative risk among studies of either diabetic or nondiabetic renal disease. No significant differences were seen between diet groups in pooled mean arterial blood pressure (diabetic and nondiabetic patients) or glycosylated hemoglobin level (diabetic patients only). Dietary protein restriction effectively slows the progression of both diabetic and nondiabetic renal diseases.",A meta-analysis of RCTs in patients with non-diabetic renal disease and RCTs or time-controlled studies with nonrandomized crossover design in patients with diabetic nephropathy revealed that dietary protein restriction effectively slows the progression of both diabetic and non-diabetic renal disease.
"Does warfarin prevent venous thromboembolic events in aPL-positive patients
To compare the risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism in patients with and without antiphospholipid antibodies. Anticardiolipin antibodies were tested 6 months after a first or second episode of venous thromboembolism. Of the patients with a first episode of venous thromboembolism only the 412 who received 6 months of anticoagulation were studied. Two hundred and eleven patients with a second episode received oral anticoagulation for 6 months or indefinitely. The therapy was targeted at an international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.0 to 2.85. All patients were followed up for 4 years after enrollment. Among the 412 patients with a first episode of venous thromboembolism the risk of recurrence was 29% in patients with anticardiolipin antibodies and 14% in those without antibodies (P = 0.0013). In those with antibodies, there was an increased risk during the first 6 months after cessation of anticoagulation. The risk of recurrence increased with the titer of the antibodies. Four-year mortality rate was 15% in those with antibodies and 6% in those without (P = 0.01). Among 34 patients with a second event of venous thromboembolism and anticardiolipin antibodies, there were no recurrences during anticoagulant therapy versus 20% in those who received only 6 months of treatment (P = 0.08). The presence of elevated titers of anticardiolipin antibodies 6 months after an episode of venous thromboembolism is a predictor for an increased risk of recurrence and of death. Patients with anticardiolipin antibodies and venous thromboembolism seem to benefit from prolonged oral anticoagulation.","One study prospectively followed patients ≥15 years old recruited from 16 hospitals in Sweden, who had their first or second episode of a VTE. Patients with malignancy or a known congenital deficiency of an inhibitor of coagulation were excluded. These patients were followed for 4 years. Each received at least 6 months of warfarin therapy (INR=2.0-2.85) after initial diagnosis of a VTE. After treatment, the 4-year recurrence rate for VTEs was 29% for patients with aPL (20/68) vs 14% for patients without (47/344) (relative risk [RR]=2.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3-3.3). The risk of death for those patients with aPL was 15% (10/68) vs 6% for those without (20/324) (RR=1.8; 95% CI, 0.9-3.6). In the same study, those with an aPL and a second clot were randomized to a second 6 months of therapy vs indefinite therapy (INR=2.0-2.85). After 4 years, their risk of another recurrence was 20% (3/15) with 6 months of therapy vs 5% (1/19) with indefinite therapy. This underpowered study did not show a statistical difference under intention-to-treat analysis; however, the single failure in the treatment group had stopped the warfarin prior to the event."
"What's the best drug treatment for premature ejaculation
Premature ejaculation/rapid ejaculation is a common but incompletely understood male sexual dysfunction. The purposes of this review are to 1) raise awareness of the prevalence and characteristics of PE/RE, its impact on the male and his partner, and the lack of approved medications indicated for its treatment, 2) encourage dialogue about PE/RE between physicians and patients, and 3) stimulate the development of appropriate new therapies. A MEDLINE search was performed to retrieve articles relating to PE/RE pathophysiology, etiology, impact, diagnosis and treatment. Sexual medicine journals not indexed in MEDLINE, sexual medicine texts and congress abstracts were also reviewed. No universally accepted definition, licensed treatment, validated screening instrument or diagnostic criteria have been established for PE/RE, and its pathophysiology and etiology are incompletely understood. Additional barriers are the reluctance of patients and physicians to talk about PE/RE and the lack of knowledge regarding available treatments. Current pharmacological treatments include off label uses of antidepressants, topical anesthetics or phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors. All are associated with drawbacks that limit their efficacy. Psychological counseling and behavioral therapy have a valuable role, although resources for this modality are limited. Prevalence rates of 20% to 30% and negative effects on the quality of life of men and their partners illustrate the need for improved, standardized methods of PE/RE diagnosis, assessment and treatment. Medications indicated specifically for PE/RE and effective on an as needed basis are required. Behavioral therapies should emphasize pleasure, arousal, control, confidence and satisfaction, and they may have the best success when coupled with pharmacological approaches.","Premature ejaculation is the most common male sexual dysfunction, but there is no universally accepted definition or validated screening instrument. The pathophysiology and etiology remain incompletely understood. Based on surveys, prevalence rates for premature ejaculation are approximately 20% to 30%."
"Should you use antibiotics to treat acute otitis media in children
Acute otitis media is one of the most common diseases in early infancy and childhood. Antibiotic use for acute otitis media varies from 31% in the Netherlands to 98% in the USA and Australia. The objective of this review was to assess the effects of antibiotics for children with acute otitis media. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); MEDLINE, Index Medicus (pre 1965), Current Contents and reference lists of articles from 1958 to January 2000. The search was updated in 2003. Randomised trials comparing antimicrobial drugs with placebo in children with acute otitis media. Three reviewers independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Ten trials were eligible based on design, only eight of the trials, with a total of 2,287 children, included patient-relevant outcomes. The methodological quality of the included trials was generally high. All trials were from developed countries. The trials showed no reduction in pain at 24 hours, but a 30% relative reduction (95% confidence interval 19% to 40%) in pain at two to seven days. Since approximately 80% of patients will have settled spontaneously in this time, this means an absolute reduction of 7% or that about 15 children must be treated with antibiotics to prevent one child having some pain after two days. There was no effect of antibiotics on hearing problems of acute otitis media, as measured by subsequent tympanometry. However, audiometry was done in only two studies and incompletely reported. Nor did antibiotics influence other complications or recurrence. There were few serious complications seen in these trials: only one case of mastoiditis occurred in a penicillin treated group. Antibiotics provide a small benefit for acute otitis media in children. As most cases will resolve spontaneously, this benefit must be weighed against the possible adverse reactions. Antibiotic treatment may play an important role in reducing the risk of mastoiditis in populations where it is more common.","A Cochrane review of 8 randomized controlled trials (RCTs)-6 double-blinded, 2287 children total-compared antibiotics with placebo for uncomplicated acute otitis media in otherwise healthy children. The review showed that children treated with antibiotics were no less likely to have pain at 24 hours after starting therapy than untreated children. However, 7% fewer children who received antibiotics had pain at 2 to 7 days than unmedicated children (number needed to treat [NNT]=15; 95% confidence interval [CI], 11-24). Children treated with antibiotics had no significant decrease in recurrence of acute otitis media (mean 0.70 vs 0.63; 95% CI, -0.22 to 0.34; odds ratio [OR]=0.99) or hearing loss (reported by a combination of tympanometry and audiometry). They did have an increase in nausea, diarrhea, and rash, however. Only 1 case of mastoiditis was reported in the included studies. Of note, 2 of the studies showed a modest increase in failure rates of placebo treatment for children younger than 2 years and children with bilateral disease. Antibiotics may benefit these groups. Overall, both the potential benefits and harms of antibiotics for acute otitis media are small."
"What is the best way to evaluate an acute traumatic knee injury
The evaluation of acute knee pain often includes radiography of the knee. To synthesize the literature to determine the role of radiologic procedures in evaluating common causes of acute knee pain: fractures, meniscal or ligamentous injuries, osteoarthritis, and pseudogout. MEDLINE search from 1966 to October 2002. We included all published, peer-reviewed studies of decision rules for fractures. We included studies that used arthroscopy as the gold standard for measuring the accuracy of the physical examination and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for meniscal and ligamentous knee damage. We included all studies on the use of radiographs in pseudogout. We extracted all data in duplicate and abstracted physical examination and MRI results into 2 x 2 tables. Among the 5 decision rules for deciding when to use plain films in knee fractures, the Ottawa knee rules (injury due to trauma and age >55 years, tenderness at the head of the fibula or the patella, inability to bear weight for 4 steps, or inability to flex the knee to 90 degrees) have the strongest supporting evidence. When the history suggests a potential meniscal or ligamentous injury, the physical examination is moderately sensitive (meniscus, 87%; anterior cruciate ligament, 74%; and posterior cruciate ligament, 81%) and specific (meniscus, 92%; anterior cruciate ligament, 95%; and posterior cruciate ligament, 95%). The Lachman test is more sensitive and specific for ligamentous tears than is the drawer sign. For meniscal tears, joint line tenderness is sensitive (75%) but not specific (27%), while the McMurray test is specific (97%) but not sensitive (52%). Compared with the physical examination, MRI is more sensitive for ligamentous and meniscal damage but less specific. When the differential diagnosis for acute knee pain includes an exacerbation of osteoarthritis, clinical features (age >50 years, morning stiffness <30 minutes, crepitus, or bony enlargement) are 89% sensitive and 88% specific for underlying chronic arthritis. Adding plain films improves sensitivity slightly but not specificity. Plain films for pseudogout are not sensitive or specific, according to limited-quality studies. We recommend the Ottawa knee rules to decide when to obtain plain films for suspected knee fracture. A careful physical examination should be sufficient to decide whether to refer patients with potential meniscal and ligament injuries, and we prefer clinical criteria rather than plain films for evaluating osteoarthritis. We do not recommend using plain films to diagnose pseudogout.","Physical examination (including the Lachman test, Drawer sign, and McMurray test) by an orthopedist or sports medicine-trained physician was 74% to 88% sensitive and 72% to 95% specific for suspected meniscal or ligamentous injuries; magnetic resonance imaging added marginal value in referral decisions regarding these conditions."
"What are the most effective ways you can help patients stop smoking
In a systematic review of the efficacy of interventions intended to help people stop smoking, data have been analyzed from 188 randomized controlled trials. Following personal advice and encouragement to stop smoking given by physicians during a single routine consultation, an estimated 2% (95% confidence limits, 1%, 3%; P < .001) of all smokers stopped smoking and did not relapse up to 1 year as a direct consequence of the advice. The effect is modest but cost-effective: the cost of saving a life is about $1500. Supplementary interventions (follow-up letters or visits, demonstration of spirometry, etc) have an additional effect--variable in extent. Advice and encouragement are particularly effective for smokers at special risk--pregnant women (efficacy; 8%) and patients with ischemic heart disease. Behavior modification techniques (relaxation, rewards and punishment, avoiding ""trigger"" situations, etc), in group or individual sessions led by a psychologist, have an effect that is statistically significant (P = .05) but no greater than simple advice by a physician (2%); yet, these techniques are several times more expensive. The effect of hypnosis is unproved (no trials have used biochemical markers). Nicotine replacement therapy is effective in an estimated 13% of smokers who seek help in cessation; the effect is greater in those who are nicotine-dependent. Other pharmacological treatments are not of proven efficacy, and acupuncture is ineffective. Sudden cessation or gradual reduction in smoking are similar in their efficacy on average. Physicians should take time to advise all their patients who smoke to quit. Smokers who are intent on stopping should be given additional support and encouraged to use nicotine replacement therapy.","Another systematic review of 188 RCTs concluded that an estimated 2% (95% CI, 1%-3%; P<.001) of all smokers stopped smoking and did not relapse for as long as a year after receiving advice and encouragement to quit smoking from their physician in a single routine consultation."
"When should you order a Lyme titer
We monitored the antibody responses of 55 treated patients with early Lyme disease and physician-documented erythema migrans. Six sequential serum samples were obtained from patients before, during, and until one year after antibiotic therapy and analyzed by in-house enzyme-linked immunosorbent (ELISA) and immunoblot assays. An immunoblot procedure utilizing a gradient gel and an image analysis system was developed. A relational database management system was used to analyze the results and provide criteria for early disease immunoblot interpretation. Recommended criteria for the immunoglobulin M (IgM) immunoblot are the recognition of two of three proteins (24, 39, and 41 kDa). The recommended criteria for a positive IgG immunoblot are the recognition of two of five proteins (20, 24 [> 19 intensity units], 35, 39, and 88 kDa). Alternatively, if band intensity cannot be measured, the 22-kDa protein can be substituted for the 24-kDa protein with only a small decrease in sensitivity. Monoclonal antibodies were used to identify all these proteins except the 35-kDa protein. With the proposed immunoblot interpretations, the sequential serum samples were examined. At visit 1, the day of diagnosis and initiation of treatment, 54.5% of the serum samples were either IgM or IgG positive. The peak antibody response, with 80% of the serum samples positive, occurred at visit 2, 8 to 12 days into treatment. The sensitivities of the IgM and IgG immunoblot for detecting patients that were seropositive into the study period were 58.5 and 54.6%, respectively, at visit 1 and 100% at visit 2. Twenty percent of the patients remained seronegative throughout the study. The specificities of the IgM and IgG immunoblots were 92 to 94% and 93 to 96%, respectively. The IgM immunoblot and ELISA were similar in sensitivities, whereas the IgG immunoblot had greater sensitivity than the IgG ELISA (P = 0.006).",A small study of 55 treated patients found peak antibody response at 8 to 12 days into treatment.
"Is therapy based on endoscopy results better than empiric therapy for dyspepsia
This review considers management strategies (combinations of initial investigation and empirical treatments) for dyspeptic patients. Dyspepsia was defined to include both epigastric pain and heartburn. To determine the effectiveness, acceptability, and cost effectiveness of the following initial management strategies for patients presenting with dyspepsia (a) initial pharmacological therapy (including endoscopy for treatment failures) (b) early endoscopy (c) testing for Helicobacter pylori and endoscope only those positive (d) H.pylori eradication therapy with or without prior testing. Trials were located through electronic searches and extensive contact with trialists. All randomised controlled trials of dyspeptic patients presenting in primary care. Data was collected on dyspeptic symptoms, quality of life and use of resources. Twenty papers reporting 23 comparisons were found. Trials comparing proton pump inhibitors (PPI) with antacids (two trials) and H2 receptor antagonists (three trials), early endoscopy with initial acid suppression (five trials), H.pylori 'test and scope' v usual management (three trials), H.pylori test and treat v. endoscopy (four trials), and test and treat v. acid suppression alone in H.pylori positive patients (two trials), were pooled. PPIs were significantly more effective than both H2RAs and antacids. Relative risks (RR) and 95% CI were, for PPI: antacid 0.72 (0.64-0.80), PPI: H2RA 0.63 (0.47-0.85). Results for other drug comparisons were either absent or inconclusive. Initial endoscopy was associated with a small reduction in the risk of recurrent dyspeptic symptoms compared with initial prescribing (RR 0.89 (0.77-1.02). H.pylori test and endoscopy increases costs in primary care, but does not improve symptoms. H.pylori test and eradicate may be as effective as endoscopy- based management and reduces costs, by decreasing the proportion of patients that are endoscoped. 'Test and treat' may be more effective than acid suppression alone, RR 0.59 (0.42-0.83). PPIs are effective in the treatment of dyspepsia in these trials which may not adequately exclude patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. The relative efficacy of H2RA and PPI is uncertain. Early investigation by endoscopy or H.pylori testing may benefit some patients with dyspepsia. The review will be updated in 2004 with an individual patient data meta-analysis of the economic data, and a subgroup analysis by age and predominant dyspeptic symptom.","Though individual studies have suggested that therapy based on endoscopy performed before any other study (early endoscopy) may be superior to empiric antisecretory therapy and as efficacious as a ""test and treat"" strategy in symptom relief, a Cochrane systematic review of 20 RCTs (11 in primary care settings) provides the best evidence on the role of early endoscopy. A subgroup analysis of 5 RCTs, which compared early endoscopy with empiric antisecretory therapy (typically for 4 weeks), revealed that early endoscopy demonstrated a trend towards improvement in self-reported symptoms and in dyspepsia symptom relief scores, but the difference was not statistically significant (relative risk [RR]=0.89; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.77-1.1). Because each study used different symptom scores, the relative risk as calculated may under-represent the true benefit of early endoscopy when compared with empiric antisecretory therapy."
"What is the risk of bowel strangulation in an adult with an untreated inguinal hernia
Although the elective repair of groin hernias is advised to prevent strangulation, the likelihood of this complication occurring is unknown. To quantify this risk, the cumulative probability of strangulation in relation to the length of history has been calculated for inguinal and femoral hernias presenting to this hospital between 1987 and 1989. Of 476 hernias (439 inguinal, 37 femoral), there were 34 strangulations (22 inguinal, 12 femoral). After 3 months the cumulative probability of strangulation for inguinal hernias was 2.8 per cent, rising to 4.5 per cent after 2 years. For femoral hernias the cumulative probability of strangulation was 22 per cent at 3 months and 45 per cent at 21 months. The rate at which the cumulative probability of strangulation increased was in both cases greatest in the first 3 months, suggesting that patients with a short history of herniation should be referred urgently to hospital and given priority on the waiting list.",A chart review found that the risk of strangulation was higher for hernias of shorter duration.
"Which treatments are effective for cervical radiculopathy
A case series of consecutive patients with cervical radiculopathy. A multitude of physical therapy interventions have been proposed to be effective in the management of cervical radiculopathy. However, outcome studies using consistent treatment approaches on a well-defined sample of patients are lacking. The purpose of this case series is to describe the outcomes of a consecutive series of patients presenting to physical therapy with cervical radiculopathy and managed with the use of manual physical therapy, cervical traction, and strengthening exercises. Eleven consecutive patients (mean age, 51.7 years; SD, 8.2) who presented with cervical radiculopathy on the initial examination were treated with a standardized approach, including manual physical therapy, cervical traction, and strengthening exercises of the deep neck flexors and scapulothoracic muscles. At the initial evaluation all patients completed self-report measures of pain and function, including a numeric pain rating scale (NPRS), the Neck Disability Index (NDI), and the Patient-Specific Functional Scale (PSFS). All patients again completed the outcome measures, in addition to the global rating of change (GROC), at the time of discharge from therapy and at a 6-month follow-up session Ten of the 11 patients (91%) demonstrated a clinically meaningful improvement in pain and function following a mean of 7.1 (SD, 1.5) physical therapy visits and at the 6-month follow-up. Ninety-one percent (10 of 11) of patients with cervical radiculopathy in this case series improved, as defined by the patients classifying their level of improvement as at least ""quite a bit better"" on the GROC. However, because a cause-and-effect relationship cannot be inferred from a case series, follow-up randomized clinical trials should be performed to further investigate the effectiveness of manual physical therapy, cervical traction, and strengthening exercises in a homogeneous group of patients with cervical radiculopathy.","A case series of patients treated specifically for cervical radiculopathy found that 10 of 11 patients who underwent physical therapy (including manual therapy, cervical traction, and strengthening exercises) were improved-defined as a self-report of being ""quite a bit better""-at 6-month follow-up."
"How does tissue adhesive compare with suturing for superficial lacerations
The objective of this study was to compare the 9- to 12-month cosmetic outcome of facial lacerations closed with rapid-absorbing gut suture (RG), octylcyanoacrylate (OC), or nylon suture (NL). We hypothesized that no important differences would exist between these methods. This prospective, randomized study enrolled consecutive patients with facial lacerations when experienced physician assistants were on duty for wound closure. Patients returned at 9 to 12 months for cosmetic evaluation. Two blinded physicians performed visual analog cosmesis scale (VACS) scoring, and the patient completed a VAS satisfaction score. One hundred forty-five patients were enrolled. Nine-month follow up occurred in 84 patients. The maximum difference within each evaluator's set of scores was 3.6 mm, well below the minimum clinically important difference (MCID) of 10 to 15 mm. We did not detect clinically important differences in cosmetic outcome at 9 to 12 months in patients with facial lacerations closed with RG, OC, or NL, although RG or OC could be preferred to eliminate follow-up visits for suture removal.","In a clinical trial reported after the Cochrane review, Holger and colleagues studied tissue adhesives against standard wound closure using either nylon or absorbable gut sutures. The study included 145 patients, 84 of whom had at least a 9-month follow-up. No significant difference was noted in a visual analog grading scale, with a 10- to 15-mm difference (out of 100 mm) considered significant."
"When is neuroimaging warranted for headache
Clinical criteria to select patients with headache in whom structural diagnostic studies (computed tomography) have a high yield disclosing intracranial pathologic findings, independent of abnormal findings on neurologic examination, have not been defined. To determine which clinical characteristics predict the presence of intracranial pathologic findings, independently of neurologic examination, in patients with headache. Case-control, consecutive sample. Major metropolitan trauma center emergency department. Hospital records of 139 hospitalized and 329 randomly selected patients from 1720 nonhospitalized adult patients, consecutively evaluated for headache in the emergency department, were reviewed. Demographic data, clinical characteristics of the headache, results of neurologic and physical examinations, and diagnostic radiologic and laboratory results were correlated with final diagnosis and outcome at 6 months after emergency department visit. Nonparametric statistical analysis. Intracranial pathologic findings were found in 18 (3.8%) of 468 patients. Acute onset and occipitonuchal location of headache, presence of associated symptoms, and patient age of 55 years or older were significantly associated with the finding of intracranial pathology, independently of the findings from neurologic examination. Abnormal findings on neurologic examination alone, whether focal or nonfocal, had a highly significant association and a positive predictive value for intracranial pathology of 39%. Abnormal results from neurologic examination are the best clinical parameters to predict structural intracranial pathology; however, in patients 55 years or older with headache of acute onset located in the occipitonuchal region that has associated symptoms, computed tomographic scan of the head is justified as part of their clinical evaluation independently of the findings of the neurologic examination.","A case-control study reviewed hospital records of 468 patients evaluated in the emergency department for nontraumatic headache. Neuroimaging (CT scan or cerebral angiogram) was performed for 160 of these patients. Final diagnosis and outcome was obtained at 6 months. The symptoms and their ability to predict intracranial pathology are as follows: abnormal neurologic examination (sensitivity=39%; LR+=19.5), location of headache (sensitivity=78%; LR+=4.87), age of patient (sensitivity=61%; LR+=2.26), multiple associated symptoms (sensitivity=61%; LR+=2.26), mode of onset of headache (sensitivity=78%; LR+=2.23), and presence of associated symptoms (sensitivity=89%; LR+=1.41). Again, abnormal neurologic examination was the most significant indicator for imaging. This study did not define associated symptoms nor did it specify what determined which patients were imaged."
"Can counseling prevent or treat postpartum depression
To test whether a cognitive-behaviour therapy intervention program reduces the prevalence of depression during the first postnatal year in mothers of very preterm babies. Prospective, single blind, randomised, controlled study. Perinatal centre in Western Australia. One hundred and ninety-nine out of 673 English-speaking mothers of infants admitted to the neonatal unit. A six-session cognitive-behaviour therapy intervention program provided by a research midwife between weeks two and six after birth. Women in the control group received standard care. Depression and anxiety disorders occurring in the first year assessed by a clinical psychologist at structured interview using the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia (SADS) at 2 weeks, 2, 6 and 12 months. One hundred and one women were randomised to the intervention group and 98 to the control group. Fifty-four mothers (27%) in the trial were diagnosed with minor or major depression in the 12 months following very preterm delivery, 29 (29%) in the intervention group and 25 (26%) in the control group (relative risk 1.1 [95% CI 0.80-1.5]). There were no differences in the time of onset or the duration of the episodes of depression between the groups. Overall, 74 mothers (37%) of the 199 met criteria for a diagnosis of psychological morbidity during the first year. Our intervention program did not alter the prevalence of depression in these mothers. Rates of depression and stress reactions are high in these mothers.","An randomized controlled trials of a 6-session cognitive-behavioral, midwife-administered intervention in mothers of preterm infants showed no preventive benefit (N=176; RR=1.02; 95% CI, 0.87-1.20)."
"What is the best macrolide for atypical pneumonia
The efficacy and tolerability of azithromycin and erythromycin in the treatment of acute respiratory tract infections in children were compared in an open, multicenter, randomized trial. A total of 151 children, aged from 2 months to 14 years, suffering from upper airways infections (60), or lower respiratory tract infections (91), were randomized to be treated either with azithromycin, 10 mg/Kg/day per os once daily for 3 or 10 mg/Kg/day 1 and 5 mg/Kg/days 2-5 (77 patients) or with erythromycin, 50 mg/Kg/day thrice daily for at least 7 days (74 patients). The two treatment groups did not significantly differ as to sex, age, weight, type and severity of infection, and infecting pathogens. Clinical evaluation was performed prior to therapy, on treatment days 1, 3, 5 and 7, and on day 10. Microbiological and laboratory assessment were carried out at baseline and after the end of therapeutic course. Chest X-ray and serologic assays for Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection were obtained in patients suspected to have lower respiratory tract infections. At the end of therapy, clinical cure was achieved in 73 out of 77 patients (94.8%) in the azithromycin group, and in 60/72 evaluable subjects (83.3%) in the erythromycin group. A significantly more rapid remission of several illness-related signs and symptoms was observed in patients treated with azithromycin. A total of 75 bacterial pathogens were isolated at baseline microbiological examination; at the end of the therapeutic course bacteriological eradication was obtained in 34/34 cases (100%) treated with azithromycin, and in 40/41 children (97.5%) treated with erythromycin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","In one study, side effects were noted in 10% of community acquired pneumonia patients on azithromycin and 20% on erythromycin (P<.05)."
"Should you treat carriers of pharyngeal group A strep
We evaluated the efficacy of rifampin in eradicating chronic pharyngeal carriage of group A streptococci. Carriers were defined as healthy children whose throat cultures showed persistence of group A streptococci 3 weeks after receiving benzathine penicillin G intramuscularly. Subsequent M and T typing of group A streptococcal isolates and limited serologic studies confirmed that enrolled patients were carriers. Thirty-eight carriers (37 completed the study) were randomly assigned to three groups: group 1 (13 patients) received no treatment; group 2 (10) received benzathine penicillin intramuscularly; group 3 (14) received benzathine penicillin intramuscularly plus rifampin orally (10 mg/kg twice a day for eight doses). Throat cultures were obtained every 3 weeks for at least 9 weeks. Group 2 and 3 patients who still had positive cultures 3 weeks after treatment were crossed to the opposite group. Cultures became negative in 93% (13 of 14) of patients in group 3, compared with 23% in group 1 and 30% in group 2 (P less than 0.001 and P less than 0.01, respectively). Including patients crossed over, the penicillin plus rifampin regimen was effective in 17 (89%) of 19 treatment courses and was significantly superior to no therapy or to penicillin alone (P less than 0.0005 and P less than 0.005, respectively). We conclude that rifampin plus benzathine penicillin intramuscularly is an effective regimen for those selected patients in whom eradication of group A streptococcal carriage is judged to be desirable.","A study found intramuscular penicillin plus 4 days of oral rifampin superior to intramuscular penicillin alone (P<.005) or no treatment at all (P<.0005) for eradicating group a streptococcal in carriers. Compared with placebo after 3 weeks of therapy, the number needed to treat for penicillin plus rifampin was 2."
"What are effective treatments for panic disorder
A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was undertaken to compare the effects of imipramine and clomipramine in the treatment of panic disorder with or without agoraphobia. The number of dropouts in the placebo-treated group was 7; in the imipramine-treated group, 4; and in the clomipramine treated group, 0. Ten subjects fulfilled the 12 weeks of treatment in the placebo group, 25 in the imipramine group, and 22 in the clomipramine group. To minimize dropouts because of side effects, a flexible dose regimen with a careful escalation of doses was applied. The maximal dose allowed was 250 mg/day. The mean (+/- SEM) daily doses reached were 124 +/- 9 mg (range, 50-250 mg) of imipramine and 109 +/- 8 mg (range, 25-200 mg) of clomipramine. At the end of the trial, the number of panic attacks as well as the anxiety between attacks (measured using the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety) were markedly reduced in patients treated with either of the two antidepressant drugs, but only slightly decreased in patients on placebo. With respect to all major outcome parameters, i.e., full panic attacks, total number of anxiety attacks (full plus mild), and anxiety between attacks, the effect of clomipramine was clearly and significantly superior to that of imipramine (p less than 0.001, p less than 0.002, and p less than 0.002, respectively). Moderate intake of diazepam was allowed; in the clomipramine group (p less than 0.006), but neither in the imipramine group nor in the placebo group, a significant decrement in diazepam intake was observed during the course of the trial. The finding that clomipramine may have a higher potency and/or efficacy than imipramine in the treatment of panic disorder supports the concept that the antipanic effect of antidepressant drugs is due to the influence of these compounds on serotonergic rather than noradrenergic neurotransmission.",Clomipramine is serotoninergic and was more effective than other tricyclics in an RCT.
"How should we treat chronic daily headache when conservative measures fail
To review medication-induced headache (MIH) through a systematic evaluation of the literature regarding the pharmacologic management of this condition. To identify and evaluate all pharmacologic interventions for MIH, we conducted a qualitative systematic review of the English-language literature from 1966 to June 1998 using MEDLINE. The following search terms were used: chronic daily headache, transformed migraine, analgesic withdrawal headache, analgesic rebound headache, drug-associated headache, medication-induced headache, detoxification, and dihydroergotamine. In addition, a review of the references from relevant literature was also conducted to collect reports not identified in the MEDLINE search. Numerous therapies for acute management of MIH have been evaluated, although no rigorously conducted clinical trials were identified. Therapies evaluated include abrupt withdrawal of analgesics, initiation of dihydroergotamine, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents, methylergonovine, dihydroergotamine, sumatriptan, amitriptyline, dexamethasone, piracetam, prothipendyl, and valproate. Epidemiology, diagnosis, clinical features, pathophysiology, and long-term prognosis of therapy are discussed and therapeutic guidelines are offered. MIH is an underrecognized and difficult condition affecting headache-prone patients. The published literature concerning treatment of patients with MIH is scant and of poor quality, making it difficult for clinicians to decide on appropriate therapy. Recognition and treatment of MIH may lead to a long-term improvement in headache relief for many patients. It appears that complete withdrawal of the medications being overused is required for favorable long-term results.","A systematic review of the therapeutic approaches to medication-induced headache looked at 18 studies from 1966 to 1998. Although most were uncontrolled small trials, medically monitored withdrawal of all symptomatic headache medications is recommended by the authors. No long-term outcome comparisons between withdrawal strategies are available."
"Does warfarin prevent venous thromboembolic events in aPL-positive patients
The optimal intensity of oral anticoagulation for the prevention of recurrent thrombosis in patients with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome is uncertain. Retrospective studies show that only high-intensity oral anticoagulation [target international normalized ratio (INR) >3.0] is effective but a recent randomized clinical trial comparing high (INR range 3.0-4.0) vs. moderate (INR 2.0-3.0) intensities of anticoagulation failed to confirm this assumption. We conducted a randomized trial in which 109 patients with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) and previous thrombosis were given either high-intensity warfarin (INR range 3.0-4.5, 54 patients) or standard antithrombotic therapy (warfarin, INR range 2.0-3.0 in 52 patients or aspirin alone, 100 mg day(-1) in three patients) to determine whether intensive anticoagulation is superior to standard treatment in preventing symptomatic thromboembolism without increasing the bleeding risk. The 109 patients enrolled in the trial were followed up for a median time of 3.6 years. Mean INR during follow-up was 3.2 (SD 0.6) in the high-intensity warfarin group and 2.5 (SD 0.3) (P < 0.0001) in the conventional treatment patients given warfarin. Recurrent thrombosis was observed in six of 54 patients (11.1%) assigned to receive high-intensity warfarin and in three of 55 patients (5.5%) assigned to receive conventional treatment [hazard ratio for the high intensity group, 1.97; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.49-7.89]. Major and minor bleeding occurred in 15 patients (two major) (27.8%) assigned to receive high-intensity warfarin and eight (three major) (14.6%) assigned to receive conventional treatment (hazard ratio 2.18; 95% CI 0.92-5.15). High-intensity warfarin was not superior to standard treatment in preventing recurrent thrombosis in patients with APS and was associated with an increased rate of minor hemorrhagic complications.","A meta-analysis of these studies (done in conjunction with the second study) remained insufficiently powered to show any significant differences between high- and moderate-intensity therapy, but there was a trend towards increased thrombosis and bleeding events in the high-intensity groups. Of note, the relative risk for developing a venous thromboembolism was lower in these studies than in those with time-limited treatment, suggesting that indefinite treatment may be indicated."
"Can you differentiate bacterial from viral pediatric infections based on the CBC
We developed logistic regression models that combine information from the automated CBC and manual 100-cell differential counts to predict bacterial infection. The logistic models were fitted from a case group of 116 patients with proven bacterial infection and a control group of 930 presumably uninfected outpatients. A 4-variable, 15-parameter model, which includes automated absolute neutrophil, manual band, and manual immature granulocyte counts, performed best with a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve area of 89%. A more practical 2-variable model including automated absolute neutrophil and manual band counts performed almost as well with an ROC curve area of 86%. The automated neutrophil count-only model is less informative with an ROC curve area of 78%. The combined information from automated and manual differential cell counts more accurately predicts bacterial infection than automated counting alone. Despite these modest improvements, the high cost of manual differential cell counts dictates careful patient selection. The supplemental information gained from manual differential counts is most useful for patients with low to normal neutrophil counts (8,000/microL [8.0 x 10(9)/L] or less). Further studies are indicated to determine the characteristic patient populations deriving maximal benefit from this information.","For acutely febrile patients, the presence of an elevated white blood cell (WBC) count with elevated band forms has dogmatically been thought of as a marker for bacterial infection."
"Which oral antifungal is best for toenail onychomycosis
The purpose of this study, which involved two dermatology clinics and two podiatric medical clinics, was to determine whether a difference exists in patient-reported satisfaction and compliance between continuous terbinafine therapy and pulse-dose itraconazole therapy for the treatment of toenail onychomycosis. Patients in this multicenter, open-label, cross-sectional study had previously completed treatment with either oral terbinafine or oral itraconazole for toenail onychomycosis. Patients were interviewed by telephone to assess clinical outcomes, compliance, and satisfaction with treatment; clinical data were collected by medical chart review. Patients reported significantly greater ease and convenience of treatment and higher overall satisfaction with continuous terbinafine therapy compared with pulse-dose itraconazole therapy.","Terbinafine is well-tolerated by most patients. A telephone survey after treatment with daily terbinafine or pulse-dose itraconazole reported greater ease and convenience, and higher overall satisfaction with continuous terbinafine vs pulse-dose itraconazole."
"Which treatments work best for hemorrhoids
Despite an abundance of nonsurgical hemorrhoid therapies, none has been consistently more efficacious. By combining data from multiple clinical trials in a meta-analysis, the present study compared the efficacy and complications of infrared coagulation, injection sclerotherapy, and rubber band ligation to determine the optimal nonoperative hemorrhoid treatment. All published clinical trials comparing the three methods were identified by computer search and review of appropriate English language journals. Five trials studying 863 patients satisfied all inclusion criteria. Results demonstrated that similar numbers of patients were asymptomatic 12 months after treatment, regardless of initial therapy. However, significantly fewer patients undergoing rubber band ligation required additional treatment because symptoms had recurred. Although rubber band ligation demonstrated greater long-term efficacy, it was associated with a significantly higher incidence of posttreatment pain. In contrast, infrared coagulation was associated with both fewer and less severe complications. Thus, when all factors are considered, infrared coagulation may in fact be the optimal nonoperative hemorrhoid treatment.",Rubber band ligation had the lowest recurrence rate at 12 months compared with the other nonoperative techniques of sclerotherapy and infrared coagulation.
"How should we treat chronic daily headache when conservative measures fail
To assess the efficacy of tizanidine hydrochloride versus placebo as adjunctive prophylactic therapy for chronic daily headache (chronic migraine, migrainous headache, or tension-type headache). Tizanidine is an alpha2-adrenergic agonist that inhibits the release of norepinephrine at both the spinal cord and brain, with antinociceptive effects that are independent of the endogenous opioid system. Previous open-label studies have suggested the drug may be effective for treatment of chronic daily headache. Two hundred patients completed a 4-week, single-blind, placebo baseline period, with 134 fulfilling selection criteria and then randomized to tizanidine or placebo. Ninety-two patients completed at least 8 weeks of treatment (tizanidine, n = 45; placebo, n = 47), and 85 patients completed 12 weeks of treatment (tizanidine, n = 44; placebo, n = 41). Most patients (77%) met the diagnostic criteria for migraine of the International Headache Society; 23% had either chronic migrainous headache or chronic tension-type headache. Tizanidine was slowly titrated over 4 weeks to 24 mg or the maximum dose tolerated (mean, 18 mg; SD, 6.4; median, 20.0; range, 2 to 24), divided equally over three dose intervals per day. Overall headache index ([headache days x average intensity x duration in hours]/28 days) was the primary end point. Tizanidine was shown to be superior to placebo in reducing the overall headache index (P =.0025), as well as mean headache days per week (P =.0193), severe headache days per week (P =.0211), average headache intensity (P =.0108), peak headache intensity (P =.0020), and mean headache duration (P =.0127). The mean percentage improvement during the last 4 weeks of treatment with tizanidine versus placebo was 54% versus 19% for the headache index (P =.0144), 55% versus 21% for severe headache days (P =.0331), 35% versus 19% for headache duration (P =.0142), 35% versus 20% for peak headache intensity (P =.0106), 33% versus 20% for average headache intensity (P =.0281), and 30% versus 22% for total headache days (P =.0593). Patients receiving tizanidine also scored higher ratings of overall headache improvement on a visual analog scale (P =.0069). There was no statistically significant difference in outcome for patients with chronic migraine versus those with only migrainous or tension-type headache. Adverse effects reported by more than 10% of the patients included somnolence (47%), dizziness (24%), dry mouth (23%), and asthenia (19%). Dropouts due to adverse events did not differ significantly between tizanidine and placebo. The results support tizanidine as an effective prophylactic adjunct for chronic daily headache, including migraine, migrainous headache, and tension-type headache. These results also suggest the possible importance of an alpha2-adrenergic mechanism underlying the pathophysiology of this spectrum of headache disorders.","Other therapies for treating chronic daily headache include the skeletal muscle relaxant tizanidine Zanaflex, which was studied in an industry-sponsored, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 92 patients. The medication was used as prophylaxis, titrating up to a dose of 8 mg 3 times daily. The overall headache index a measure of headache intensity, frequency, and duration significantly decreased. The headache index decreased in the tizanidine group from 2.6 to 1.2, and in the placebo group from 2.6 to 2.1 P =.0025. Decreases in headache frequency and headache intensity were less dramatic but still significant. This trial lasted only 12 weeks, so longer-term outcomes are not available."
"What's the best way to screen for anxiety and panic disorders
This study examined the Panic Disorder Self-Report (PDSR), a new self-report diagnostic measure of panic disorder based on the 4th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (American Psychiatric Association, 1994). PDSR diagnoses were compared with structured interview diagnoses of individuals with generalized anxiety disorder, social phobia, and panic disorder and nonanxious controls. Receiver operating characteristic analyses revealed that the PDSR showed 100% specificity and 89% sensitivity. The PDSR also demonstrated retest reliability, convergent and discriminant validity, and kappa agreement of .93 with a structured interview. Finally, the PDSR demonstrated clinical validity. Students who were identified as having panic disorder using the PDSR did not have significantly different scores on the Panic Disorder Severity Scale--Self-Report form (P. R. Houck, D. A. Speigel, M. K. Shear, & P. Rucci, 2002) than a panic disordered community sample. However, both groups had significantly higher scores than students identified as not meeting criteria for panic disorder.","The PDSR shows 100% specificity at the recommended cut-off point and a good negative likelihood ratio. Its weaknesses are a small study size, the homogeneity of the study population, who were self-selected, as well as the lengthiness of the questionnaire."
"What are the best prophylactic drugs for migraine
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have recently been used in the treatment of migraine. We studied the safety and efficacy of fluoxetine in the prevention of migraine. Between February 1997 and December 1997, we examined 52 patients (33 women) at the Headache Diagnosis and Therapy Service of the Second University of Naples. Ages ranged from 18 to 65 years, and all patients suffered from migraine without aura according to IHS 1988 criteria. The sample was divided into two groups: group A included 32 patients (19 women; mean age, 36.8 years [SD 12.4]) who received fluoxetine at a dosage of 20 mg per day; group B included 20 patients (14 women; mean age, 38.8 years [SD 15.6]) who received placebo. Our study was a single-center, randomized, double-blind, parallel study of fluoxetine for the prophylactic control of migraine and consisted of two phases: 30 days of pharmacological wash out and 6 months of therapy with monthly follow-up. Patients were randomly assigned to two groups: A, fluoxetine or B, placebo. At the first visit, patients provided a detailed history and underwent neurological evaluation and a Zung test for depression. No pathological values were revealed. In order to monitor symptomatology, all patients received a form for the calculation of the total pain index at monthly follow-up. A comparison of the total pain index between basal values (calculated during the period of wash out) and monthly follow-up (calculated monthly during the period of 6 months of the therapy) showed significant reduction (P < .05) beginning from the third month of treatment in the fluoxetine group and no significant reduction in the placebo group. Even if preliminary and to be confirmed, these data seem to support the use of fluoxetine in the treatment of migraine.",A study of patients with migraine without aura found a 57% reduction in total pain index-a value based on pain intensity and hours of headache per month-with fluoxetine compared with an insignificant 31% reduction with placebo.
"What are effective medication combinations for dyslipidemia
Patients with combined dyslipidemia are at high risk for coronary artery disease and often require combination drug therapy to achieve lipid levels recommended by the US National Cholesterol Education Program's third Adult Treatment Panel (ATP III). In addition to recommendations for low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and triglyceride levels, ATP III established non-high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol goals for individuals with triglycerides >or=2.26 mmol/L (>or=200 mg/dL). It also introduced certain criteria for the diagnosis of the metabolic syndrome, a clustering of risk factors (abdominal obesity, elevated triglycerides, low HDL cholesterol, elevated blood pressure, impaired fasting glucose) that increases cardiovascular risk and is common in patients with combined dyslipidemia. Statin monotherapy has been shown to benefit these patients, and additional benefit may be obtained by combination therapy that provides greater reductions in both LDL cholesterol and triglycerides as well as greater increases in HDL cholesterol. However, combining a statin with either niacin or a fibrate may increase the risk for myopathy and therefore requires careful monitoring and evaluation of the risk-benefit ratio for each patient. Moreover, combination therapy may be associated with increased drug costs and decreased patient compliance. Recently developed agents that may improve the effectiveness of combination therapy include ezetimibe-a cholesterol absorption inhibitor-and a formulation that combines extended-release niacin and lovastatin in a single pill. Clinical trials are needed to determine the optimal treatment in patients with combined dyslipidemia.","Combinations of statins with fibrates (fenofibrate [Tricor], gemfibrozil [Lopid]) can treat combined dyslipidemia by decreasing low density lipoprotein cholesterol more than 40%, decreasing triglycerides over 50%, and raising high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol more than 20%."
"Do inhaled steroids increase the risk of osteoporosis
Inhaled corticosteroids form the main therapy for asthma, but there is increasing concern about the potential systematic effects of long-term inhaled corticosteroids including their effect on bone metabolism and bone loss. To determine the effect of inhaled corticosteroids use on biochemical markers of bone turnover, bone mineral density and the development of fractures. We searched the Cochrane Airways Group trials register, electronic reference databases, UK National Research Register, bibliographies of included studies, and contacted pharmaceutical companies. Randomised trials of the effect of inhaled steroid versus placebo on markers of bone function and metabolism, in adults with asthma or mild COPD. Trial quality was assessed and data extracted from the papers included (2 reviewers per paper) and from additional data supplied by the authors. Of 438 references found, seven met the inclusion criteria. Three studies were in healthy subjects asthma or COPD. The patients were generally less than 60 years old and the male:female ratio was 2:1. There was no evidence of increased risk of loss of bone mineral density (BMD) or fractures. There was no significant change in osteocalcin at conventional doses of inhaled corticosteroids (Standardised Mean Difference [SMD] -0.34 (95% Confidence Interval [CI] -0.72, 0.04), although a statistically significant change was seen in those studies using experimental doses of inhaled steroid in excess of the doses recommended by the British Thoracic Society SMD 0.97 (95% CI -1.61, -0.34). A statistically significant change in parathyroid hormone seen in one small short trial (n=10, 6 weeks) may have been due to the trial design and outcome measurements used. In patients with asthma or mild COPD, there is no evidence of an effect of inhaled corticosteroid at conventional doses given for two or three years on BMD or vertebral fracture. Higher doses were associated with biochemical markers of increased bone turnover, but data on BMD and fractures at these doses are not available. There is a need for further, even longer term prospective studies of conventional and high doses of inhaled corticosteroids.","Three RCTs (792 subjects total) examined the effect of conventional doses of inhaled corticosteroids on bone mineral density and 2 of the RCTs (892 participants total) collected fracture data. No demonstrable effect was seen on vertebral fracture (odds ratio [OR]=1.87; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.5-7.03) or bone mineral density at 2 years follow-up. The subjects were otherwise healthy people with asthma or COPD with an average age of 40 years; men outnumbered women 2 to 1."
"Are oral agents effective for the treatment of verruca vulgaris
To assess the role of levamisole in treatment of different types of warts, a double-blind study was conducted on 40 patients with different types of warts. Patients were divided into two equal groups, A and B. Group A received levamisole 5 mg/kg body weight on 3 consecutive days every 2 weeks for a period up to 5 months, while patients of group B received placebo for the same period. In group A, 12 patients showed complete cure (60%), two showed partial cure (10%), and the remaining six patients showed no response (30%). In group B, complete cure was achieved only in one case. The higher cure rate was observed in plane and common warts, while plantar warts showed no improvement with levamisole treatment.",1 nonrandomized controlled trial found levamisole at 5 mg/kg for 3 days every 2 weeks to be superior to placebo in achieving complete cure of warts in a group of 40 patients.
"How accurate is the clinical diagnosis of pneumonia
Community-acquired pneumonia is an important cause of acute respiratory symptoms (eg, cough) in the ambulatory care setting. Distinguishing pneumonia from other causes of respiratory illnesses, such as acute bronchitis and upper respiratory tract infections, has important therapeutic and prognostic implications. The reference standard for diagnosing pneumonia is chest radiography, but it is likely that many physicians rely on the patient's history and their physical examination to diagnose or exclude this disease. A review of published studies of patients suspected of having pneumonia reveals that there are no individual clinical findings, or combinations of findings, that can rule in the diagnosis of pneumonia for a patient suspected of having this illness. However, some studies have shown that the absence of any vital sign abnormalities or any abnormalities on chest auscultation substantially reduces the likelihood of pneumonia to a point where further diagnostic evaluation may be unnecessary. This article reviews the literature on the appropriate use of the history and physical examination in diagnosing community-acquired pneumonia.","Nine symptoms (cough, dyspnea, sputum production, subjective fever, chills, night sweats, myalgias, sore throat, and rhinorrhea) and 3 items in the past medical history (asthma, immunosuppression, and dementia) were associated with pneumonia. For most elements of history, both the positive and negative likelihood ratios (LR+, LR-) were in the indeterminate range of 0.5 to 2.0. No single feature was sufficient to either rule in or rule out the diagnosis. In one study, the absence of any vital sign abnormalities reduced the likelihood of pneumonia substantially (LR- = 0.18), but did not rule out the diagnosis completely. Egophony had an LR+ of 5.3. Other physical findings (rhonchi, crackles, decreased breath sounds, dullness to percussion, and bronchial breath sounds) yielded LR+s from 1.5 to 3.5, respectively. Most individual findings were insufficient to diagnose pneumonia. For example, if the baseline prevalence of pneumonia was 5%, the presence of crackles raised the probability to 10% and their absence decreased the probability to 3%."
"Which complementary therapies can help patients with PMS
To evaluate the efficacy of vitamin B-6 in the treatment of premenstrual syndrome. Systematic review of published and unpublished randomised placebo controlled trials of the effectiveness of vitamin B-6 in the management of premenstrual syndrome. Nine published trials representing 940 patients with premenstrual syndrome. Proportion of women whose overall premenstrual symptoms showed an improvement over placebo. A secondary analysis was performed on the proportion of women whose premenstrual depressive symptoms showed an improvement over placebo. Odds ratio relative to placebo for an improvement in overall premenstrual symptoms was 2.32 (95% confidence interval 1.95 to 2.54). Odds ratio relative to placebo for an improvement in depressive symptoms was 1.69 (1.39 to 2.06) from four trials representing 541 patients. Conclusions are limited by the low quality of most of the trials included. Results suggest that doses of vitamin B-6 up to 100 mg/day are likely to be of benefit in treating premenstrual symptoms and premenstrual depression.","A meta-analysis of pyridoxine in doses from 50 to 600 mg per day for PMS included 9 RCTs. Relative to placebo, pyridoxine improved PMS symptom scores (odds ratio=2.32, 95% confidence interval, 1.95-2.54). The overall quality of studies was poor, however, with few subjects, widely varying doses, and different outcome measurements."
"What's the most effective treatment for giardiasis
To compare the efficacy and safety of five days apostrophe therapy of mebendazole (MBZ) versus quinacrine (QC) on human giardiasis in children. A clinical trial was carried out in paediatric patients (aged 5-15 years) with confirmed symptomatic G. duodenalis mono-infection. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either MBZ [200 mg taken three times per day (TID) (n = 61)] or QC [2 mg/kg bodyweight tid (n = 61)], both for five days. Follow-up faecal samples were obtained at 3, 5 and 7 d after the end of the treatment. Although the frequency of cure was higher for QC (83.6%) than for MBZ (78.7%), the difference was not statistically significant (P > 0.05). Adverse events were reported more in the QC group (P < 0.05), all of them transient and self-limiting. Despite final cure rates ocurring lower than expected, the overall results of this study reconfirmed the efficacy of MBZ in giardiasis and also indicate that, although comparable to QC, at least in this setting the 5 d course of MBZ did not appear to improve the cure rates in this intestinal parasitic infection.",An randomized controlled trials in Cuban children 5 to 15 years of age found no difference in clinical cure rate between a 5-day course of mebendazole and more traditional therapy with quinacrine.
"What is the best medical therapy for new-onset type 2 diabetes
To compare the metabolic effects of pioglitazone, metformin, and glimepiride in the treatment of Japanese patients with newly diagnosed Type 2 diabetes. A total of 114 patients with Type 2 diabetes who had never used oral hypoglycaemic drugs were studied for 12 months. Patients were randomly assigned to pioglitazone (30-45 mg/day, n = 38), metformin (750 mg/day, n = 39), or glimepiride (1.0-2.0 mg/day, n = 37). The effect of treatment on fasting plasma glucose (FPG), glycated haemoglobin (HbA(1c)), 1,5-anhydroglucitol (1,5AG), total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol, triglycerides, free fatty acids (FFA), and fasting plasma insulin levels was monitored monthly. Body weight and safety data were also collected. Eight patients withdrew from the study (three in the pioglitazone group, two in the metformin group, and three in the glimepiride group). The rate of reduction of HbA(1c) was fastest in patients receiving glimepiride and slowest in patients receiving pioglitazone. Although there were no significant differences among the three groups in HbA(1c) levels at the end of the study, patients taking pioglitazone had relatively lower FPG and 1,5AG levels than patients taking the other two drugs. These results suggest that pioglitazone acts predominantly on nocturnal metabolism rather than at mealtimes. FFA were reduced significantly in those taking pioglitazone (542.2 microEq/l vs. 237.3 microEq/l; P < 0.01) before a decrease in HbA(1c) was apparent. The change in FFA levels correlated with the change in HbA(1c) (r = 0.409, P < 0.01). There were no significant differences in other lipid parameters among the groups. Pioglitazone, metformin, and glimepiride are equally effective in reducing blood glucose in patients with newly diagnosed Type 2 diabetes. However, their specific characteristics, such as the rapid action on blood glucose levels of glimepiride and the favourable action on FPG and FFA of pioglitazone, should be considered when choosing an appropriate agent.","Head-to-head studies are difficult to compare since hypoglycemic medications may reach peak effects at different times. An randomized controlled trials compared glimepiride (Amaryl), pioglitazone (Actos), and metformin over 12 months of use by 114 patients with diabetes. There was no difference among the groups in overall HbA1c reduction. However, glimepiride decreased HbA1c rapidly over 1 month and reached a nadir at 4 months. Pioglitazone did not reduce HbA1c until 6 months and reached its nadir at 7 to 9 months. Metformin produced an intermediate response."
"How can you best diagnose idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus
There are no currently accepted evidence-based guidelines for the diagnosis and management of the normal-pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) patient. As a result, an independent study group was assembled to address this issue and determine the feasibility of developing standardized guidelines, which would be acceptable in the United States and abroad and would be based on the available scientific evidence. The guidelines were to encompass value of clinical presentation, value of supplementary diagnostic tests, surgical management, and outcome assessment. Initially, a series of 10 questions were formulated in the areas of pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment to obtain a consensus by panels of experts (see Acknowledgments) assembled in San Antonio, TX, in September 2000. This workshop provided significant insight into the difficulties in developing NPH guidelines, and a consensus was reached as to those questions involving expert opinion. Subsequently, evidentiary tables were developed on the basis of the available evidence. Only those studies with 20 or more idiopathic NPH (INPH) patients were included. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values for INPH diagnostic criteria were assessed, and guidelines were developed on the basis of the available evidence. Recommendations for classification of INPH and additional studies were documented. The development of the guidelines was made difficult because systematic studies of INPH and patient numbers were few. It was decided to maintain the classification of NPH into two major categories, INPH and those of known cause (secondary NPH). Many studies ""mixed"" these classifications, and as a result, they could not be used in the evidentiary tables. Despite these problems, evidence-based guidelines were developed, and it is hoped that they will be useful in guiding clinical management of the INPH patient.","There is no definitive test or physical finding for INPH. For patients over 40 years of age, INPH has an insidious onset, a progressive course, and lacks an identifiable antecedent cause. A brain imaging study reveals ventricular enlargement not attributable to other causes. Some suggest that the diagnosis be assessed as ""probable"", ""possible"", and ""unlikely"" based on the degree of fulfillment of a set of historical, imaging, clinical, and physiological criteria."
"Which urinary tract infection therapies are safe and effective during breastfeeding
Guidelines for the management of acute uncomplicated cystitis in women that recommend empirical therapy in properly selected patients rely on the predictability of the agents causing cystitis and knowledge of their antimicrobial susceptibility patterns. To assess the prevalence of and trends in antimicrobial resistance among uropathogens causing well-defined episodes of acute uncomplicated cystitis in a large population of women. Cross-sectional survey of antimicrobial susceptibilities of urine isolates collected during a 5-year period (January, May, and September 1992-1996). Health maintenance organization. Women aged 18 to 50 years with an outpatient diagnosis of acute cystitis. Proportion of uropathogens demonstrating in vitro resistance to selected antimicrobials; trends in resistance over the 5-year study period. Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus saprophyticus were the most common uropathogens, accounting for 90% of the 4342 urine isolates studied. The prevalence of resistance among E coli and all isolates combined was more than 20% for ampicillin, cephalothin, and sulfamethoxazole in each year studied. The prevalence of resistance to trimethoprim and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole rose from more than 9% in 1992 to more than 18% in 1996 among E coli, and from 8% to 16% among all isolates combined. There was a statistically significant increasing linear trend in the prevalence of resistance from 1992 to 1996 among E coli and all isolates combined to ampicillin (P<.002), and to cephalothin, trimethoprim, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (P<.001). In contrast, the prevalence of resistance to nitrofurantoin, gentamicin, and ciprofloxacin hydrochloride was 0% to 2% among E coli and less than 10% among all isolates combined, and did not change significantly during the 5-year period. While the prevalence of resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, ampicillin, and cephalothin increased significantly among uropathogens causing acute cystitis, resistance to nitrofurantoin and ciprofloxacin remained infrequent. These in vitro susceptibility patterns should be considered along with other factors, such as efficacy, cost, and cost-effectiveness in selecting empirical therapy for acute uncomplicated cystitis in women.",TMP/SMX is not recommended if the local resistance rate is more than 10% to 20%. Beta-lactams are associated with high levels of resistance and therefore not recommended in empiric treatment of UTI.
"What's the best way to treat Achilles tendonopathy
Achilles tendinopathy is a common overuse injury, especially among athletes involved in activities that include running and jumping. Often an initial period of rest from the pain-provoking activity is recommended. To prospectively evaluate if continued running and jumping during treatment with an Achilles tendon-loading strengthening program has an effect on the outcome. Randomized clinical control trial; Level of evidence, 1. Thirty-eight patients with Achilles tendinopathy were randomly allocated to 2 different treatment groups. The exercise training group (n = 19) was allowed, with the use of a pain-monitoring model, to continue Achilles tendon-loading activity, such as running and jumping, whereas the active rest group (n = 19) had to stop such activities during the first 6 weeks. All patients were rehabilitated according to an identical rehabilitation program. The primary outcome measures were the Swedish version of the Victorian Institute of Sports Assessment-Achilles questionnaire (VISA-A-S) and the pain level during tendon-loading activity. No significant differences in the rate of improvements were found between the groups. Both groups showed, however, significant (P < .01) improvements, compared with baseline, on the primary outcome measure at all the evaluations. The exercise training group had a mean (standard deviation) VISA-A-S score of 57 (15.8) at baseline and 85 (12.7) at the 12-month follow-up (P < .01). The active rest group had a mean (standard deviation) VISA-A-S score of 57 (15.7) at baseline and 91 (8.2) at the 12-month follow-up (P < .01). No negative effects could be demonstrated from continuing Achilles tendon-loading activity, such as running and jumping, with the use of a pain-monitoring model, during treatment. Our treatment protocol for patients with Achilles tendinopathy, which gradually increases the load on the Achilles tendon and calf muscle, demonstrated significant improvements. A training regimen of continued, pain-monitored, tendon-loading physical activity might therefore represent a valuable option for patients with Achilles tendinopathy.","An randomized controlled trials of 38 patients compared rest with eccentric training and continued activity and eccentric training for 12 weeks to 6 months using a pain-monitored model. Both groups showed similar improvement in pain and function when measured with the Swedish version of the Achilles assessment questionnaire (VISA-A-S 100-point scale: 0=worst function, 100=completely recovered). The baseline mean VISA-A-S scores were 57 for both groups; the mean scores after 12 months were 85 for the exercise group and 91 for the rest group."
"Which complementary therapies can help patients with PMS
Previous reports have suggested that disturbances in calcium regulation may underlie the pathophysiologic characteristics of premenstrual syndrome and that calcium supplementation may be an effective therapeutic approach. To evaluate the effect of calcium carbonate on the luteal and menstrual phases of the menstrual cycle in premenstrual syndrome, a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter clinical trial was conducted. Healthy, premenopausal women between the ages of 18 and 45 years were recruited nationally across the United States at 12 outpatient centers and screened for moderate-to-severe, cyclically recurring premenstrual symptoms. Symptoms were prospectively documented over 2 menstrual cycles with a daily rating scale that had 17 core symptoms and 4 symptom factors (negative affect, water retention, food cravings, and pain). Participants were randomly assigned to receive 1200 mg of elemental calcium per day in the form of calcium carbonate or placebo for 3 menstrual cycles. Routine chemistry, complete blood cell count, and urinalysis were obtained on all participants. Daily documentation of symptoms, adverse effects, and compliance with medications were monitored. The primary outcome measure was the 17-parameter symptom complex score. Seven hundred twenty women were screened for this trial; 497 women were enrolled; 466 were valid for the efficacy analysis. There was no difference in age, weight, height, use of oral contraceptives, or menstrual cycle length between treatment groups. There were no differences between groups in the mean screening symptom complex score of the luteal (P = .659), menstrual (P = .818), or intermenstrual phase (P = .726) of the menstrual cycle. During the luteal phase of the treatment cycle, a significantly lower mean symptom complex score was observed in the calcium-treated group for both the second (P = .007) and third (P < .001) treatment cycles. By the third treatment cycle calcium effectively resulted in an overall 48% reduction in total symptom scores from baseline compared with a 30% reduction in placebo. All 4 symptom factors were significantly reduced by the third treatment cycle. Calcium supplementation is a simple and effective treatment in premenstrual syndrome, resulting in a major reduction in overall luteal phase symptoms.","A randomized controlled trials (466 patients) comparing 1000 and 1200 mg of calcium with placebo found a significant decrease in PMS symptoms after 3 treatment cycles. Calcium improved negative affect, water retention, food cravings, and pain. The study found that, by the third treatment cycle, patients taking calcium had an overall 48% reduction in total symptom scores, compared with a 30% reduction in the control group. The most common adverse effects were headache, rhinitis, and nonspecific pain."
"Which lab tests are best when you suspect hypothyroidism
These clinical practice guidelines summarize the recommendations of the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists for the diagnostic evaluation of hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism and for treatment strategies in patients with these disorders. The sensitive thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH or thyrotropin) assay has become the single best screening test for hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism, and in most outpatient clinical situations, the serum TSH is the most sensitive test for detecting mild thyroid hormone excess or deficiency. Therapeutic options for patients with Graves' disease include thyroidectomy (rarely used now in the United States), antithyroid drugs (frequently associated with relapses), and radioactive iodine (currently the treatment of choice). In clinical hypothyroidism, the standard treatment is levothyroxine replacement, which must be tailored to the individual patient. Awareness of subclinical thyroid disease, which often remains undiagnosed, is emphasized, as is a system of care that incorporates regular follow-up surveillance by one physician as well as education and involvement of the patient.","Once thyroid-stimulating hormone is in the normal range, experts recommend assessing the level after 6 months and then annually."
"What is the most effective treatment for acute low back pain
Several randomized trials have suggested recently that epidural steroid injections may not be a valid treatment in common low back pain and sciatica. To clarify this issue, we conducted a critical appraisal of relevant randomized trials published up to 1997. Attention was directed to methodological quality, results, and clinical implications. A Medline search identified 13 trials published between 1966 and 1997. Trial methodology was evaluated using a 100-point grid based on four groups of items, namely study population, therapeutic intervention, evaluation method, and data presentation and analysis. Methodology quality scores ranged from 12 to 84 and were unrelated to the results of epidural steroid therapy. Five trials demonstrated greater pain relief within the first month in the steroid group as compared to the control group. Eight trials found no measurable benefits. Obstacles to meaningful comparisons across studies included differences in the patient populations, steroid used, volume injected, and number of injections. None of the published studies used the injection modalities that are standard practice in France. Whether epidural steroids are effective in common low back pain and sciatica cannot be determined based on our review.",No consistent conclusions could be drawn regarding the effectiveness of epidural steroid injections for acute low back pain. This analysis was limited by the inclusion of all studies of patients with acute low back pain regardless of the underlying etiology and presence or absence of radicular symptoms.
"Is osteopathic manipulation effective for headaches
Migraine headache affects approximately 11 million adults in the United States. Spinal manipulation is a common alternative therapy for headaches, but its efficacy compared with standard medical therapies is unknown. To measure the relative efficacy of amitriptyline, spinal manipulation and the combination of both therapies for the prophylaxis of migraine headache. A prospective, randomized, parallel-group comparison. After a 4-wk baseline period, patients were randomly assigned to 8 wk of treatment, after which there was a 4-wk follow-up period. Chiropractic college outpatient clinic. A total of 218 patients with the diagnosis of migraine headache. An 8-wk course of therapy with spinal manipulation, amitriptyline or a combination of the two treatments. A headache index score derived from a daily headache pain diary during the last 4 wk of treatment and during the 4-wk follow-up period. Clinically important improvement was observed in both primary and secondary outcomes in all three study groups over time. The reduction in headache index scores during treatment compared with baseline was 49% for amitriptyline, 40% for spinal manipulation and 41% for the combined group; p = .66. During the posttreatment follow-up period the reduction from baseline was 24% for amitriptyline, 42% for spinal manipulation and 25% for the combined group; p = .05. There was no advantage to combining amitriptyline and spinal manipulation for the treatment of migraine headache. Spinal manipulation seemed to be as effective as a well-established and efficacious treatment (amitriptyline), and on the basis of a benign side effects profile, it should be considered a treatment option for patients with frequent migraine headaches.","In 1 trial of migraine prophylaxis, 218 patients were randomized to either 14 sessions of spinal manipulative therapy for 2 months or oral amitriptyline (titrated up weekly during the first month and continued at 100 mg daily over the second month). The headache index (a measure of daily pain intensity) was equivalent in both groups in the last 4 weeks of treatment (ES for spinal manipulative therapy vs amitriptyline= -0.1; 95% CI, -0.5 to 0.3). A month after both therapies were stopped, there was a nonsignificant trend toward a lower headache index in the group that had received spinal manipulative therapy than the group that had received amitriptyline (ES=0.4; 95% CI, 0.0-0.8). Ten percent of the medication group withdrew from this study due to side effects; no side effects were reported from SMT."
"Are major bleeding events from falls more likely in patients on warfarin
To compare the frequency and severity of fall-related injuries in anticoagulated patients undergoing rehabilitation after stroke to nonanticoagulated stroke patients undergoing rehabilitation. Retrospective chart review. Free-standing rehabilitation hospital. 264 patients who sustained falls while undergoing intensive inpatient rehabilitation after stroke. Injuries, categorized as minor (abrasions and bruises) or major (intracranial hemorrhage, fracture, major bleeding). A total of 400 falls in 264 patients undergoing inpatient stroke rehabilitation were reviewed. One hundred thirty-one falls were sustained by 93 patients receiving anticoagulation, whereas 269 falls were sustained by 175 patients not receiving anticoagulation. In both the anticoagulation group and the control (nonanticoagulated) group, approximately one in five falls resulted in minor injuries (abrasions or bruises). Three fractures occurred, but no major bleeding events or intracranial hemorrhage occurred in either group. The risk for minor injury secondary to fall is comparable between the two groups, and the risk is low in this setting for hemorrhagic injuries in stroke patients falling while receiving anticoagulation.","A study of 400 consecutive falls among 264 post-stroke patients in a rehab hospital found no difference in minor injury rates (19% vs 18%, NS); no major hemorrhagic complications were seen following 131 falls in the anticoagulation group (93 patients) and 269 falls in the group not on anticoagulation (175 patients). Patients on anticoagulation had an average protime of 16.1 seconds (INR was not reported). The calculated risk of major hemorrhage in an anticoagulated patient from a single fall was 2.3% or less. The study was limited because most falls were from a seated position or partially controlled by an attendant; few patients fell from a standing position."
"What best prevents exerciseinduced bronchoconstriction for a child with asthma
Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (or asthma) following strenuous physical exertion is common and can cause sub-optimal performance, symptoms such as cough, dyspnea, wheeze, chest tightness, and can lead people to avoid physical activity. Management focuses on prevention with pre-exercise treatment using various pharmacologic agents. Mast cell stabilizing agents are effective in attenuating exercise-induced bronchoconstriction but their effectiveness compared to bronchodilator agents is unclear. To quantitatively compare the effects of inhaling a single dose of either mast cell stabiliser - nedocromil sodium or sodium cromoglycate - to a single dose of short acting beta-agonists or anti-cholinergic agents - atropine or ipratropium bromide - prior to a strenuous exercise challenge in participants with asthma who are at least 6 years of age and suffer from reproducible exercise-induced bronchoconstriction. The review also compares the effects between a short acting beta-agonist alone to a combination of a short acting beta-agonist + mast cell stabiliser. We searched the Cochrane Airways Group ASTHMA and WHEEZ* trials register, Cochrane CENTRAL, Current Contents, review articles, textbooks and reference lists of articles. We also contacted the drug manufacturer and primary authors for additional citations. Randomised trials comparing a single prophylactic dose of a mast cell stabiliser to a short acting beta-agonist, anti-cholinergic agent, or a short acting beta-agonist alone to a combination of short acting beta-agonist plus a mast cell stabiliser to prevent exercise-induced bronchoconstriction in asthmatics over six years old. The exercise challenge had to conform to acceptable standards and pulmonary function (PFT) reported as percent decrease from baseline of FEV1 or peak flow. Complete protection (maximum % fall PFT <15% post-exercise) and clinical protection (50% improvement over placebo effect) measures were included. Trial inclusion and quality assessments were conducted independently by two reviewers using standardised forms. A second reviewer confirmed data extraction and calculations. Attempts were made to contact study authors. The pooled estimate involving continuous pulmonary function measures are reported as a weighted mean difference (WMD), dichotomous data as an odds ratio (OR), both with 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) using a random effects model. Heterogeneity tests for pooled results were performed. Twenty-four trials (518 participants) conducted in 13 countries between 1976 and 1998 were included. All drugs were effective at attenuating the exercise-induced bronchoconstriction response but to varying degrees even within the same individual. Compared to anti-cholinergic agents, mast cell stabilisers were somewhat more effective at attenuating bronchoconstriction. On average the maximum fall on MCS was reduced to 7.1% compared to 13.8% on AC ( WMD = 6.7%; 95% CI: 3.3 to 10.0), provided more individuals with complete protection (73% vs 56%; OR = 2.2; 95% CI: 1.3 to 3.7) and clinical protection (73% vs 52%; OR = 2.7; 95% CI: 1.1 to 6.4). There were no subgroup differences based on age, severity, or study quality, and no adverse effects were reported for either agent group. When compared to short acting beta-agonists mast cell stabilisers were not as effective at preventing deterioration. On average the maximum fall on MCS was 11.2% compared to 4.3% on beta agonists ( WMD = 6.8%; 95% CI: 4.5 to 9.2). MCS provided fewer individuals with complete protection (66% vs 85%; OR = 0.3; 95% CI: 0.2 to 0.5) or clinical protection (55% vs 77%; OR = 0.4; 95% CI: 0.2 to 0.8). There were no significant subgroup differences based on age, severity, drug, delivery, or study quality. A non-significant difference in side effects was demonstrated with 11% of short acting beta-agonist patients experiencing side effects compared to 3% of those receiving mast cell stabilisers (OR = 0.2; 95% CI: 0.0 to 8.2). Combining masta-agonist patients experiencing side effects compared to 3% of those receiving mast cell stabilisers (OR = 0.2; 95% CI: 0.0 to 8.2). Combining mast cell stabilisers with a short acting beta-agonist did not produce significant advantages to pulmonary function over short acting beta-agonists alone. On average the maximum fall on SABA only was reduced to 5.3% compared to 3.5% on the combination ( WMD = 1.8%; 95% CI: -1.1 to 4.6). Beta-agonists alone provided fewer individuals with complete protection (68% vs 80%; OR = 0.5; 95% CI: 0.2 to 1.4) or clinical protection (70% vs 86%; OR=0.4; 95% CI: 0.1 to 1.2) but the difference did not reach significance (p=0.17). There were no subgroup differences. In a population of stable asthmatics short acting beta-agonists, mast cell stabilisers, or anticholinergics will provide a significant protective effect against exercise-induced bronchoconstriction with few adverse effects. On average, SABAs resulted in more effective attenuation than mast cell stabilisers, while mast cell stabilisers were more effective than anti-cholinergic agents. Combining SABA and mast cell stabilisers may be appropriate in selected cases. The variability in the individual degree of response to these drugs in multi arm trials suggests clinicians and patients work together to identify the most effective prophylactic therapy.","A systematic review of 24 RCTs (of which 13 evaluated children) showed that SABAs, mast cell stabilizers, and anticholinergics provide a significant protective effect against exercise-induced bronchoconstriction with few adverse effects (the child subgroup analyses did not differ significantly from pooled results). Mast cell stabilizers were found less effective at attenuating bronchoconstriction than SABAs, with an average maximum decrease in the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) of 11.9% compared with 4.6% for beta-agonists (child subgroup: weighted mean difference=7.3%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.9-10.7). Complete protection (defined in this study as maximum % decrease in FEV1 <15% post-exercise) and clinical protection (50% improvement over placebo) measures were included. Fewer children had complete protection (pooled: 66% vs 85%, odds ratio [OR]=0.3; 95% CI, 0.2-0.5) or clinical protection (pooled: 55% vs 77%, OR=0.4; 95% CI, 0.2-0.8). Mast cell stabilizers were more effective than anticholinergic agents, with average maximum FEV1 decrease of 9.4% compared with 16.0% on anticholinergics (child subgroup: weighted mean difference=6.6%; 95% CI, 1.0-12.2). They also provided more individuals with complete protection (pooled: 73% vs 56%, OR=2.2; 95% CI, 1.3-3.7) and clinical protection (pooled: 73% vs 52%, OR=2.7; 95% CI, 1.1-6.4). Combining mast cell stabilizers with SABAs did not produce significant advantages in pulmonary function over SABAs alone. No significant subgroup differences were seen based on age, severity, or study quality."
"What is the prognosis for acute low back pain
Patients with back pain receive quite different care from different types of health care practitioners. We performed a prospective observational study to determine whether the outcomes of and charges for care differ among primary care practitioners, chiropractors, and orthopedic surgeons. Two hundred eight practitioners in North Carolina were randomly selected from six strata: urban primary care physicians (n = 39), rural primary care physicians (n = 48), urban chiropractors (n = 32), rural chiropractors (n = 32), orthopedic surgeons (n = 29), and primary care providers at a group-model health maintenance organization (HMO) (n = 28). The practitioners enrolled consecutive patients with acute low back pain. The patients were contacted by telephone periodically for up to 24 weeks to assess functional status, work status, use of health care services, and satisfaction with the care received. The status at six months was ascertained for 1555 of the 1633 patients enrolled in the study (95 percent). The times to functional recovery, return to work, and complete recovery from low back pain were similar among patients seen by all six groups of practitioners, but there were marked differences in the use of health care services. The mean total estimated outpatient charges were highest for the patients seen by orthopedic surgeons and chiropractors and were lowest for the patients seen by HMO and primary care providers. Satisfaction was greatest among the patients who went to the chiropractors. Among patients with acute low back pain, the outcomes are similar whether they receive care from primary care practitioners, chiropractors, or orthopedic surgeons. Primary care practitioners provide the least expensive care for acute low back pain.","A larger study involved 1555 patients during a 6-month follow up after an episode of acute low back pain. The article reports a mean of 16 days to functional recovery, although only 69% of the patients considered themselves ""completely recovered"" at 6 months."
"Does surgery for carpal tunnel syndrome improve outcomes
Carpal tunnel syndrome results from entrapment of the median nerve in the wrist. Common symptoms are tingling, numbness, and pain in the hand that may radiate to the forearm or shoulder. Most symptomatic cases are treated non-surgically. The objective is to compare the efficacy of surgical treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome with non-surgical treatment. We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Trials Register (January 2008), MEDLINE (January 1966 to January 2008), EMBASE (January 1980 to January 2008) and LILACS (January 1982 to January 2008). We checked bibliographies in papers and contacted authors for information about other published or unpublished studies. We included all randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing any surgical and any non-surgical therapies. Two authors independently assessed the eligibility of the trials. In this update we found four randomised controlled trials involving 317 participants in total. Three of them including 295 participants, 148 allocated to surgery and 147 to non-surgical treatment reported information on our primary outcome (improvement at three months of follow-up). The pooled estimate favoured surgery (RR 1.23, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.46). Two trials including 245 participants described outcome at six month follow-up, also favouring surgery (RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.39).Two trials reported clinical improvement at one year follow-up. They included 198 patients favouring surgery (RR 1.27, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.53). The only trial describing changes in neurophysiological parameters in both groups also favoured surgery (RR 1.44, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.97). Two trials described need for surgery during follow-up, including 198 patients. The pooled estimate for this outcome indicates that a significant proportion of people treated medically will require surgery while the risk of re-operation in surgically treated people is low (RR 0.04 favouring surgery, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.17). Complications of surgery and medical treatment were described by two trials with 226 participants. Although the incidence of complications was high in both groups, they were significantly more common in the surgical arm (RR 1.38, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.76). Surgical treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome relieves symptoms significantly better than splinting. Further research is needed to discover whether this conclusion applies to people with mild symptoms and whether surgical treatment is better than steroid injection.",A Cochrane review based on only 1 randomized controlled trials of 22 patients published in 1964 concluded that surgical treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome appears to be more effective than wrist splinting.
"How can you help prevent a recurrence of diverticulitis
Determining the optimal strategy for elective colectomy in patients with diverticular disease involves a balance of the morbidity, mortality, costs, and quality of life associated with both elective and expectant management. We used decision and cost analysis to simulate the clinical and economic outcomes after recovery from an episode of nonsurgically treated diverticulitis to determine the preferable management strategy. A Markov model was constructed to evaluate lifetime risks of death and colostomy, care costs, and quality of life associated with elective colectomy after subsequent episodes of diverticulitis. The analysis was from the payer's perspective, using hypothetical cohorts of 35- and 50-year-old patients who recovered from a nonsurgically treated diverticulitis episode. Probabilities of clinical events and costs for the base-case analysis were derived from a large cohort using a statewide administrative database and published estimates. Performing colectomy after the fourth rather than the second episode in patients older than 50 years resulted in 0.5% fewer deaths, 0.7% fewer colostomies, and saved US 1,035 dollars per patient. In younger patients, performing colectomy after the fourth episode compared with the first episode resulted in 0.1% fewer deaths, 2% fewer colostomies, and saved US 5,429 dollars per patient. Expectant management through three recurrent episodes with elective colectomy after the fourth episode was the dominant strategy across the full range of the variables tested in the sensitivity analysis compared with earlier intervention. This study suggests that expectant management is associated with lower rates of death and colostomy and is cost-saving for both younger and older patients.","A decision analysis using a Markov model found that performing a colectomy after a fourth, rather than a second, episode of diverticulitis would result in somewhat fewer deaths and colostomies, equivalent quality-adjusted years of life, and cost savings per patient of $1035 to $5429. The results held for both older and younger patients."
"What evaluation is best for an isolated, enlarged cervical lymph node
A standardized extended field-of-view sonographic examination technique of the neck is evaluated. In a prospective study we screened 50 patients suspected of having carcinoma or lymphoma for enlarged cervical lymph nodes. After conventional CT of the neck, extended field-of-view sonography was performed using defined axial parallel scanning sequences. The results were interpreted separately by two radiologists. Of 245 lymph nodes (diameter 1 cm or greater) diagnosed with conventional CT, 218 were correctly identified by extended field-of-view ultrasonography. With respect to the entire neck, the sensitivity of extended field-of-view sonography was 92%, and the correlation coefficient between the methods was r = 0.98 (P < 0.001). Fifteen of 17 false-negative lymph nodes were located in the mandibular angle region. False-positive results (N = 10) were caused by misinterpretation of primary tumors, blood vessels, lobulated salivary glands, and double imaged lymph nodes. Our results indicate that extended field-of-view sonography in parallel scanning sequences represents a reliable method for the detection of cervical lymphadenopathy.",A study of 50 patients with lymphadenopathy on computerized tomography demonstrated the sensitivity of ultrasound was 92% in identifying the same nodes.
"What is the best diagnostic approach to alopecia in women
To describe an organized diagnostic approach for both nonscarring and scarring alopecias to help family physicians establish an accurate in-office diagnosis. To explain when ancillary laboratory workup is necessary to confirm the diagnosis. Current diagnostic and therapeutic interventions for hair loss are based on randomized controlled studies, uncontrolled studies, and case series. MEDLINE was searched from January 1966 to December 1998 with the MeSH words alopecia, hair, and alopecia areata. Articles were selected on the basis of experimental design, with priority given to the most current large multicentre controlled studies. Overall global evidence for therapeutic intervention for hair loss is quite strong. The most common forms of nonscarring alopecias are androgenic alopecia, telogen effluvium, and alopecia areata. Other disorders include trichotillomania, traction alopecia, tinea capitis, and hair shaft abnormalities. Scarring alopecia is caused by trauma, infections, discoid lupus erythematosus, or lichen planus. Key to establishing an accurate diagnosis is a detailed history, including medication use, systemic illnesses, endocrine dysfunction, hair-care practices, and family history. All hair-bearing sites should be examined. A 4-mm punch biopsy of the scalp is useful, particularly to diagnose scarring alopecias. Once a diagnosis has been established, specific therapy can be initiated. Diagnosis and management of hair loss is an interesting challenge for family physicians. An organized approach to recognizing characteristic differential features of hair loss disorders is key to diagnosis and management.","The ""pull test"" is often used to assess ongoing hair loss. If more than 10% of hairs are pulled away from the scalp, the test is positive, suggesting active hair shedding."
"Does birth weight predict childhood obesity
To compare young children 3 to 6 years of age who were born small-for-gestational age (SGA; <10th percentile for gestational age) or large-for-gestational age (LGA; >/=90th percentile) with those who were born appropriate-for-gestational age (10th-89th percentile) to determine whether there are differences in growth and fatness in early childhood associated with birth weight status. National sample of 3192 US-born non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and Mexican-American children 3 to 6 years of age (36-83 months) examined in the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and for whom birth certificates were obtained. On the birth certificates, length of gestation from the mother's last menstrual period was examined for completeness, validity, and whether the pattern of missing (n = 141) and invalid data (n = 147) on gestation was random. Gestation was considered invalid when >44 weeks, or when at gestations of </=35 weeks, birth weight was inconsistent with gestation. To reclaim cases with missing or invalid data on gestation for analysis, a multiple imputation (MI) procedure was used. MI procedures are recommended when, as in this case, a critical covariate (length of gestation) is not missing at random, and complete-subject analysis may be biased. Using the results of the MI procedure, children were categorized, and growth outcome was assessed by birth weight-for-gestational age status. The growth outcomes considered in these analyses were body weight (kg), height (cm), head circumference (cm), mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC; cm), and triceps and subscapular skinfold thicknesses (mm). The anthropometric outcomes first were transformed to approximate normal distributions and converted into z scores (standard deviation units [SDU]) to scale the data for comparison across ages. Outcomes at each age then were estimated using regression procedures. SUDAAN software that adjusts variance estimates to account for the sample design was used in analysis for prevalence estimates and to calculate regression coefficients (in SDU). Over these ages, children born SGA remained significantly shorter and weighed less (-0.70 to -0.60 SDU). Children born LGA remained taller and weighed more (0.40-0.60 SDU). For weight and height among LGA children, there was a divergence from the mean with age compared with those born appropriate-for-gestational age (10th-89th percentile). Head circumference and MUAC followed these same patterns. The coefficients for MUAC show values for SGA children fairly consistently at about -0.50 SDU and children born LGA show increasing MUAC from +0.40 to +0.50 SDU from 36 to 83 months of age. As with weight, there is a trend toward increased MUAC coefficients with age. Measures of fatness (triceps and subscapular skinfolds), which are more prone to environmental influences, showed less association with birth weight-for-gestational age status. Only a single age group, the oldest (6 years of age) group showed a significant deficit in fatness for children born SGA. For children born LGA, there was an increase in fatness at both the triceps and subscapular sites after 3 years of age. These findings on a national sample of US-born non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and Mexican-American children show that children born SGA remain significantly shorter and lighter throughout early childhood and do not seem to catch up from 36 to 83 months of age. LGA infants remain longer and heavier through 83 months of age, but unlike children born SGA, children born LGA may be prone to an increasing accumulation of fat in early childhood. Thus, early childhood may be a particularly sensitive period in which there is increase in variation in levels of fatness associated with size at birth. These findings have implications for the evaluation of the growth of young children. The results indicate that intrauterine growth is associated with size in early childhood. (ABSTR","A US national cohort study of 3192 children adjusted for gestational age, found that large-for-gestational-age (LGA) infants with birth weights above the 90th percentile remained longer and heavier through 83 months of life. The triceps and subscapular skinfold measurements at 3 years of age for children born large-for-gestational-age were virtually identical to those of children born appropriate for gestational age, but by 6 years of age, skinfold measurements had diverged considerably, to more than 0.60 standard deviations. The researchers concluded that intrauterine growth is associated with obesity in early childhood."
"What is the best hypnotic for use in the elderly
The widespread use of sedative-hypnotics in older populations makes it imperative to identify hazardous regimens that should be avoided and safer regimens that may be used preferentially by older people. Although benzodiazepines have been shown to increase fall and fracture risk, zolpidem, a nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic, has been advocated as a safer alternative. Case-control study of hip fracture cases and controls in 1994. All subjects were age 65 and older and enrolled in Medicare, and in Medicaid or the Pharmaceutical Assistance to the Aged and Disabled program of New Jersey. Cases (n=1,222) were patients who underwent surgical repair of a hip fracture. They were frequency-matched to four controls (n=4,888) based on age and gender. Use of sedative-hypnotics and other medications was assessed in the 180 days before the index event. We assessed other covariates, including demographic, clinical, and healthcare utilization variables in the prior 180 days. Zolpidem use was associated with a significant increased risk of hip fracture (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 1.95; 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.09-3.51). Other psychotropic medication classes with significantly increased risks included benzodiazepines (AOR 1.46; 95% CI=1.21-1.76), antipsychotic medications (AOR 1.61; 95% CI=1.29-2.01), and antidepressants (AOR 1.46; 95% CI=1.22-1.75). In subanalyses, preferential use of zolpidem by subjects at greater risk of hip fracture did not appear to explain the apparent risk of hip fracture with zolpidem use. Use of zolpidem by older people was associated with nearly twice the risk of hip fracture, even after controlling for possible demographic and clinical confounders. Rather than being a safer alternative, zolpidem may be associated with risks that are as great as those seen with conventional benzodiazepines in older patients.","But zolpidem increased risk of hip fracture in a case control study (adjusted odds ratio=1.95, 95% confidence interval, 1.09-3.51)."
"When should travelers begin malaria prophylaxis
Three hundred and fifty-nine US Marines participated in a randomized double-blind clinical trial to assess tolerance of two prophylactic mefloquine regimens [250 mg salt weekly (n = 157) or 250 mg daily for 3 days followed by 250 mg weekly (n = 46)] compared with 300 mg weekly chloroquine (n = 156) over a 12-week period. The study participants were seen daily for four days, then weekly for 11 weeks. On each visit, the subject answered two computerized questionnaires (a review of body systems and an evaluation of mood states), participated in a physician interview, and was administered medications under supervision. A random sample of each group was assigned to either pharmacokinetic sampling or two wear a wrist watch size computerized sleep monitor (actigraph). The frequencies of intercurrent illness and other concomitant medications were tabulated. End study mefloquine plasma levels were obtained on all study participants. The results obtained showed no compromise in function due to dizziness or incoordination in the mefloquine groups. Overall, both weekly mefloquine and loading dose mefloquine were well tolerated. Sleep disturbance and increased dream activity were detected in the mefloquine groups. Depressive feelings were noted in two to three times more individuals in the mefloquine groups than in the chloroquine group early in the course of the study, and resolved in the majority of subjects as tolerance developed.

Homeopathy involves the use, in dilution, of substances which cause symptoms in their undiluted form. It is one of the most widespread forms of complementary medicines and is also used to treat asthma. The objective of this review was to assess the effects of homeopathy in people with chronic stable asthma. We searched the Cochrane Airways Group trials register, the Cochrane Complementary Medicine Field trials register, the Glasgow Homeopathic Hospital database, the Münchener Modell database and reference lists of articles. Searches were current as of August 2003. Randomised trials of homeopathy for the treatment of stable chronic asthma, with observation periods of at least one week were included. Data extraction was undertaken by two reviewers. Trial quality was assessed by the reviewers. Six trials with a total of 556 people were included. These trials were all placebo-controlled and double-blind, but of variable quality. They used different homeopathic treatments which precluded quantitative pooling of results for the primary outcome. Standardised treatments in these trials are unlikely to represent common homeopathic practice, where treatment tends to be individualised. No trial reported a significant difference on validated symptom scales. There were conflicting results in terms of lung function between the studies. There has been only a limited attempt to measure a 'package of care' effect (i.e., the effect of the medication as well as the consultation, which is considered a vital part of individualised homeopathic practice). There is not enough evidence to reliably assess the possible role of homeopathy in asthma. As well as randomised trials, there is a need for observational data to document the different methods of homeopathic prescribing and how patients respond. This will help to establish to what extent people respond to a 'package of care' rather than the homeopathic intervention alone.","A Cochrane review of 6 RCTs of mixed quality, with a total of 556 patients, concluded the evidence is insufficient to evaluate the possible role of homeopathy for the treatment of asthma, due to heterogeneity of interventions, patient populations, and outcome assessments. Each study evaluated a different homeopathic remedy, making any overall assessment difficult. The review notes there have been only limited attempts to study a complete ""package of care"", which includes the in-depth, one-on-one consultation, treatment, and follow-up that characterizes most homeopathic treatment in practice."
"How effective are dietary interventions in lowering lipids in adults with dyslipidemia
Epidemiologic studies link Mediterranean-type diets to a low incidence of cardiovascular disease; however, few dietary intervention studies have been undertaken, especially in primary prevention. In the Mediterranean Diet, Cardiovascular Risks and Gene Polymorphisms (Medi-RIVAGE) study, the effects of a Mediterranean-type diet (Med group) or a low-fat diet (low-fat group) on risk factors were evaluated in 212 volunteers (men and women) with moderate risk factors for cardiovascular disease. After the 3-mo dietary intervention, changes in many risk factors were evaluated. Dietary questionnaires and plasma nutritional markers were used to test compliance. Although the dietary goals were only partially reached, changes in dietary habits were observed in both groups (n = 169): protein, carbohydrate, and fiber intakes increased and fat quality (decreased saturated fat and increased monounsaturated or polyunsaturated fat) improved. BMI, total and triacylglycerol-rich lipoprotein (TRL) cholesterol, triacylglycerols, TRL triacylglycerols, apolipoproteins A-I and B, insulinemia, glycemia, and the homeostasis model assessment score were significantly lower after 3 mo. The reductions in total cholesterol, triacylglycerols, and insulinemia remained significant after adjustment for BMI. There was a trend for a diet-by-time interaction for LDL cholesterol (P = 0.09). Our data predicted a 9% reduction in cardiovascular disease risk with the low-fat diet and a 15% reduction with this particular Mediterranean diet. After a 3-mo intervention, both diets significantly reduced cardiovascular disease risk factors to an overall comparable extent.","An randomized controlled trials with 88 participants reported reduced low density lipoprotein among subjects assigned to a Mediterranean-type diet. Mean baseline lipid values (mg/dL) were total cholesterol, 255.22; LDL, 170.15; HDL, 58.01; triglycerides, 141.71."
"What is the best treatment for diabetic neuropathy
To undertake a quantitative overview of trials of topical capsaicin for the treatment of diabetic neuropathy, osteoarthritis, post-herpetic neuralgia, and psoriasis. A systematic search of the literature using both computerized and manual methods for identifying clinical trials of capsaicin. The trials identified were abstracted for response data, which then were analysed using established meta-analytic methods for both fixed and random effects modelling. The odds ratio of the response rate of subjects receiving topical capsaicin relative to that of subjects on placebo was used as the main outcome measure. The difference in the response rate was used as the response variable under the random effects model. When dropouts were mentioned and unambiguous assignment could not be made, the analysis was made on the basis of intention to treat. Capsaicin cream give more pain relief to patients with diabetic neuropathy than placebo did. The odds ratio (OR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (95% CI) in favour of capsaicin cream were OR = 2.74 (95% CI = 1.73, 4.32). Using a random effect model the rate difference (RD) in favour of capsaicin cream was RD = 0.25 (95% CI = 0.15, 0.35). Capsaicin cream was also better than placebo in providing pain relief in osteoarthritis: OR = 4.36 (95% CI = 2.77, 6.88) and RD = 0.29 (95% CI = 0.20, 0.37) and in psoriasis: OR = 2.80 (95% CI = 1.69, 4.62) and RD = 0.35 (95% CI = 0.14, 0.56). There was, however, evidence of heterogeneity in the individual RDs in psoriasis, and complete binding was difficulty because of the initial discomfort associated with topical capsaicin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","Studies involving topical agents are also limited. According to an information summary,3 a total of 4 trials have addressed the efficacy of topical capsaicin for neuropathic pain. Compared with placebo, capsaicin reduces pain (NNT=4; 95% CI, 2.9-6.7)."
"Is pneumococcal vaccine effective in nursing home patients
The effectiveness of pneumococcal vaccine in the immunocompetent elderly remains controversial. We report the results of a multicenter, case-control study of 244 controls and 122 patients, aged 55 years and older, hospitalized during a 5-year period with pneumococcal bacteremia, meningitis, or other bacteriologically confirmed pneumococcal infection. Two controls per patient were matched on the basis of admission date, hospital records, and underlying diseases. All subjects were selected without knowledge of immunization status with pneumococcal vaccine, and were excluded if there was evidence for immunosuppression due to disease or iatrogenic causes. The clinical effectiveness of the vaccine was calculated to be 70% (95% confidence intervals [CI], 37% to 86%) in this population, based on a Mantel-Haenszel point estimate of the odds ratio of 0.30 (95% CI, 0.14% to 0.63%; P less than 0.005). The clinical effectiveness of pneumococcal vaccine in preventing pneumococcal infection in the immunocompetent elderly approximates the vaccine's effectiveness in the general immunocompetent population.","A case-control study by Sims and colleagues also found the vaccine to have efficacy of 70% (95% CI, 37%- 86%) in preventing invasive pneumococcal disease in immunocompetent patients aged ≥ 55 years."
"How best to manage the patient in term labor whose group B strep status is unknown
Group B streptococcus (GBS) remains a leading cause of serious neonatal infection despite great progress in perinatal GBS disease prevention in the 1990s. In 1996, CDC, in collaboration with other agencies, published guidelines for the prevention of perinatal group B streptococcal disease (CDC. Prevention of perinatal group B streptococcal disease: a public health perspective. MMWR 1996;45[RR-7]:1-24). Data collected after the issuance of the 1996 guidelines prompted reevaluation of prevention strategies at a meeting of clinical and public health representatives in November 2001. This report replaces CDC's 1996 guidelines. The recommendations are based on available evidence and expert opinion where sufficient evidence was lacking. Although many of the recommendations in the 2002 guidelines are the same as those in 1996, they include some key changes: * Recommendation of universal prenatal screening for vaginal and rectal GBS colonization of all pregnant women at 35-37 weeks' gestation, based on recent documentation in a large retrospective cohort study of a strong protective effect of this culture-based screening strategy relative to the risk-based strategy * Updated prophylaxis regimens for women with penicillin allergy * Detailed instruction on prenatal specimen collection and expanded methods of GBS culture processing, including instructions on antimicrobial susceptibility testing * Recommendation against routine intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis for GBS-colonized women undergoing planned cesarean deliveries who have not begun labor or had rupture of membranes * A suggested algorithm for management of patients with threatened preterm delivery * An updated algorithm for management of newborns exposed to intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis Although universal screening for GBS colonization is anticipated to result in further reductions in the burden of GBS disease, the need to monitor for potential adverse consequences of intrapartum antibiotic use, such as emergence of bacterial antimicrobial resistance or increased incidence or severity of non-GBS neonatal pathogens, continues, and intrapartum antibiotics are still viewed as an interim strategy until GBS vaccines achieve licensure.","The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) 2002 revised guidelines recommend universal screening by culture at 35 to 37 weeks, with 2 exceptions: women who had group b streptococcus bacteriuria during the current pregnancy and women who have given birth to an infant with invasive group b streptococcus disease."
"How should we follow athletes after a concussion
Females comprise an increasing percentage of the athlete population across all age groups, and analysis of recent literature reveals that they sustain more concussions in collegiate sports. Results of human and animal studies indicate that females may have poorer outcomes after traumatic brain injury; however, no return-to-play guideline takes sex or other individual differences into account. In the present study the authors evaluated the influence of patient sex on objective neurocognitive performance and subjective reporting of symptoms following sports-related concussion. According to preseason baseline neurocognitive computerized testing in 2340 male and female high school and collegiate athletes, individuals who sustained sports-related concussions (155 persons) were reevaluated using an alternate form of the cognitive test. Sex differences in the magnitude of cognitive change from baseline levels and the subjective experience of symptoms were analyzed. To account for the possible protective effects of helmets, comparisons were performed among females, males with helmets, and males without helmets; none of the female athletes wore helmets. Female athletes had significantly greater declines in simple and complex reaction times relative to preseason baseline levels, and they reported more postconcussion symptoms compared with males. As a group, females were cognitively impaired approximately 1.7 times more frequently than males following concussions. Furthermore, females experienced more objective and subjective adverse effects from concussion even after adjusting for the use of helmets by some groups of male athletes (for example, in football). Return-to-play decisions and concussion management must be objective and made on an individual basis, including consideration of factors such as patient sex rather than relying on a one-size-fits-all guideline.",Women with concussions are 1.7 times more likely to have cognitive impairment than men.
"Are antibiotics effective in preventing pneumonia for nursing home patients
To quantify the protective efficacy of influenza vaccine in elderly persons. A MEDLINE search was done using the index terms influenza vaccine, vaccine efficacy, elderly, mortality, hospitalized, and pneumonia. Appropriate references in the initially selected articles were also reviewed. Only cohort observational studies with mortality assessment were included in the meta-analysis. In addition, 3 recent case-control studies, 2 cost-effectiveness studies, and 1 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial were reviewed. Vaccine and epidemic virus strains, age and sex of patients, severity of illness, patient status, and study design were recorded. Upper respiratory illness, hospitalization, pneumonia, and mortality were used as outcome measures. In a meta-analysis of 20 cohort studies, the pooled estimates of vaccine efficacy (1-odds ratio) were 56% (95% Cl, 39% to 68%) for preventing respiratory illness, 53% (Cl, 35% to 66%) for preventing pneumonia, 50% (Cl, 28% to 65%) for preventing hospitalization, and 68% (Cl, 56% to 76%) for preventing death. Vaccine efficacy in the case-control studies ranged from 32% to 45% for preventing hospitalization for pneumonia, from 31% to 65% for preventing hospital deaths from pneumonia and influenza, from 43% to 50% for preventing hospital deaths from all respiratory conditions, and from 27% to 30% for preventing deaths from all causes. The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial showed a 50% or greater reduction in influenza-related illness. Recent cost-effectiveness studies confirm the efficacy of influenza vaccine in reducing influenza-related morbidity and mortality and show that vaccine provides important cost savings per year per vaccinated person. Despite the paucity of randomized trials, many studies confirm that influenza vaccine reduces the risks for pneumonia, hospitalization, and death in elderly persons during an influenza epidemic if the vaccine strain is identical or similar to the epidemic strain. Influenza immunization is an indispensable part of the care of persons 65 years of age and older. Annual vaccine administration requires the attention of all physicians and public health organizations.","A meta-analysis of 20 cohort studies showed a 53% efficacy (95% confidence interval [CI], 35-66)-defined as 1 minus the odds ratio-for influenza immunization in preventing pneumonia."
"What is the best treatment for infants with colic
To evaluate the effectiveness of diets, drug treatment, and behavioural interventions on infantile colic in trials with crying or the presence of colic as the primary outcome measure. Controlled clinical trials identified by a highly sensitive search strategy in Medline (1966-96), Embase (1986-95), and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, in combination with reference checking for further relevant publications. Keywords were crying and colic. Two independent assessors selected controlled trials with interventions lasting at least 3 days that included infants younger than 6 months who cried excessively. Methodological quality was assessed by two assessors independently with a quality assessment scale (range 0-5). Effect sizes were calculated as percentage success. Effect sizes of trials using identical interventions were pooled using a random effects model. 27 controlled trials were identified. Elimination of cows' milk protein was effective when substituted by hypoallergenic formula milks (effect size 0.22 (95% confidence interval 0.09 to 0.34)). The effectiveness of substitution by soy formula milks was unclear when only trials of good methodological quality were considered. The benefit of eliminating cows' milk protein was not restricted to highly selected populations. Dicyclomine was effective (effect size 0.46 (0.33 to 0.60)), but serious side effects have been reported. The advice to reduce stimulation was beneficial (effect size 0.48 (0.23 to 0.74)), whereas the advice to increase carrying and holding seemed not to reduce crying. No benefit was shown for simethicone. Uncertainty remained about the effectiveness of low lactose formula milks. Infantile colic should preferably be treated by advising carers to reduce stimulation and with a one week trial of a hypoallergenic formula milk.","A systematic review analyzed controlled clinical trials lasting at least 3 days involving infants less than 6 months of age who cried excessively. Twenty-seven studies were included; the outcome measure was colic symptoms, typically reported as duration of crying. Two reports studying hypoallergenic (protein hydrolysate) formula in nearly 130 infants found an effect size of 0.22 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.10-0.34) for the hypoallergenic formula. Additionally, 3 behavioral trials (involving nearly 200 infants) revealed the benefits of reduced stimulation of the colicky infant (effect size of 0.48; 95% CI, 0.23-0.74)."
"What is the best treatment for mild to moderate acne
Clindamycin/benzoyl peroxide gel has demonstrated clinical efficacy in the treatment of acne vulgaris through both antibacterial and anti-inflammatory means. Benzoyl peroxide may exert its antibacterial activity by the interaction of oxidized intermediates with elements of bacterial cells. Clindamycin inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunits causing inhibition of peptide-bond formation. Benzoyl peroxide decreases inflammatory damage by inhibiting the release of reactive oxygen species from polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) through the killing of PMNs. Clindamycin suppresses the complement-derived chemotaxis of polymorphonuclear leukocytes in vitro, thereby reducing the potential for inflammation. Several well designed clinical trials have demonstrated that twice-daily application of clindamycin 1%/benzoyl peroxide 5% gel for 10 to 16 weeks was more effective in reducing the number of inflammatory lesions than benzoyl peroxide 5%, clindamycin 1% or vehicle in patients with mild to moderately severe acne. Two studies also showed clindamycin/benzoyl peroxide to be more effective than benzoyl peroxide, clindamycin or vehicle in reducing total lesions, and one study showed clindamycin/benzoyl peroxide to be significantly more efficacious than clindamycin or vehicle in reducing the number of noninflammatory lesions. Moreover, in two trials, physician-rated mean global improvement scores, as well as patient-rated scores in one of those trials, were significantly greater in the clindamycin/benzoyl peroxide group than in the benzoyl peroxide, clindamycin or vehicle groups. In another study, clindamycin/benzoyl peroxide was as efficacious as benzoyl peroxide/erythromycin in the reduction of inflammatory and noninflammatory lesions and in raising mean global improvement scores, but was significantly more effective than benzoyl peroxide in the reduction of inflammatory lesions and in increasing both physician- and patient-assessed global improvement scores. Clindamycin/benzoyl peroxide gel applied twice daily was well tolerated in clinical trials in patients with acne, and has a tolerability profile similar to that of benzoyl peroxide alone. The most common adverse events were dry skin, peeling, erythema and rash; however, adverse event-caused treatment discontinuation rates for patients using clindamycin/benzoyl peroxide were low, ranging from 0 to 0.8%. CONCLUSIONS: Clindamycin/benzoyl peroxide gel has demonstrated efficacy and good overall tolerability in several well designed clinical studies in the topical treatment of patients with mild to moderately severe acne vulgaris. Clindamycin/benzoyl peroxide was more effective than benzoyl peroxide, clindamycin or vehicle, and similar in efficacy to benzoyl peroxide/erythromycin in the reduction of inflammatory lesions and in raising physician- and patient-assessed mean global improvement scores. It may be useful in treating patients with acne caused by resistant strains of Propionibacterium acnes. Clindamycin/benzoyl peroxide gel is an effective topical agent in the treatment of patients with mild to moderately severe acne. It is a suitable alternative for patients who are currently using topical antibacterials either alone or in conjunction with other topical anti-acne agents or systemic antibacterials.","A recent narrative review of clinical trials concluded that clindamycin plus benzoyl peroxide was more effective in reducing inflammatory lesions than monotherapy with either agent alone, and was similar in efficacy to benzoyl peroxide/erythromycin combination."
"How should you document a patient's refusal to undergo a necessary intervention
Patients' thoughts, feelings and desires are communicated in a variety of ways, and require sympathetic, critical interpretation. Patients need clear, evidence-based medical information so that they can make their own decisions about whether to consent to or refuse medical treatment. Treatment refusal may provide an opportunity to introduce patients to advance care planning. Unconscious motivations in doctors may obstruct good clinical decision-making. Although respect for the patient's responsibility to make healthcare decisions should be a condition of the clinical relationship, healthcare decision-making is a collaborative process.",The reasons for the refusal should be explored.
"What is the best therapy for superficial thrombophlebitis
In a prospective, double-blind, randomized trial the efficacy of a heparinoid in ointment form was assessed in treating superficial thrombophlebitis developing after continuous intravenous infusion. One hundred surgical patients were studied, and clinical examination and the iodine-125-labelled fibrinogen test used to assess the results. The mean time required for the relief of local symptoms and signs and the rate of local decline in radioactivity differed significantly between patients receiving the heparinoid cream and those recieving the placebo.",A double-blind trial of topical heparin showed it to be superior to placebo in reducing symptoms and speeding healing.
"What is the best surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma in chronic carriers of hepatitis B
There is currently no evidence that screening patients at risk for hepatocellular carcinoma reduces mortality from the disease. Nonetheless, screening is widely practiced. Screening is a process that includes selecting patients, applying screening tests, deciding on recall policies, and subsequently proving or disproving the presence of cancer. The literature on screening for hepatocellular carcinoma is confusing at best, and does not adequately consider the many biases that result from uncontrolled and retrospective studies. Nonetheless, screening can be justified because it is likely that mortality is decreased by adequate treatment of small cancers, particularly in the era of liver transplantation. False-positive screening test results are common. Once an abnormal screening result is obtained there is little guidance from the literature as to how patients should be investigated further, nor about how to determine whether the screening test result was a false-positive. This should at minimum include short interval follow-up with CT scans and MRI's.","Many serum markers and screening methods have been proposed to detect hepatocellular carcinoma at a treatable stage, but only 2-AFP and US-are in clinical use."
"How should you manage a depressed patient unresponsive to an SSRI
There are limited data comparing medication strategies in patients with treatment-resistant depression. In this study, we compared the effects of combining citalopram and bupropion-SR versus switching to the other monotherapy in treatment-resistant depression. This was a naturalistic, open-label cohort study. Patients with DSM-IV major depressive disorder who had not responded to at least 1 previous antidepressant and at least 6 weeks of treatment with citalopram or bupropion-SR were treated in a standard clinical protocol. In alternate months, eligible consecutive patients were treated by adding citalopram or bupropion-SR, or by switching to the other medication. Patients were assessed at baseline and after 6 weeks of treatment with the 29-item version of the Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, Seasonal Affective Disorders Version (SIGH-SAD). A total of 61 patients completed the study: 32 in the combination condition and 29 in the monotherapy switch condition. The combination condition was superior to the monotherapy switch in the SIGH-SAD change score (-14.8 vs. -10.1, respectively, p <.04) and the proportion of patients in clinical remission (28% vs. 7%, p <.05). There were no differences in the proportion of patients who had side effects or in the severity of the side effects experienced. The results of this cohort study suggest that combining citalopram and bupropion-SR is more effective than switching to a monotherapy. Combination treatment was well tolerated with no greater side effect burden than monotherapy. Limitations of this study include the nonrandomized design, open-label treatment, and small sample size.","There is cohort study evidence that combining citalopram and bupropion is more effective than switching to the alternate antidepressant, but other cohort studies did not find a significant difference between switching and augmenting."
"Do glucosamine and chondroitin worsen blood sugar control in diabetes
With increasing use of glucosamine-containing supplements for the treatment of osteoarthritis, there is increasing concern in the medical community about possible toxic effects. The present study was undertaken to determine whether glucosamine supplementation altered hemoglobin A1c concentrations in patients with well-controlled diabetes mellitus. To evaluate possible effects of glucosamine supplementation on glycemic control in a selected population of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Placebo-controlled, double-blinded, randomized clinical trial. Outpatient, diabetes monitoring clinic. Patients were typically elderly patients, evenly divided between men and women. Most of the patients were being treated with 1 or 2 drugs for glycemic control. In daily doses for 90 days, patients received either placebo or a combination of 1500 mg of glucosamine hydrochloride with 1200 mg of chondroitin sulfate (Cosamin DS; Nutramax Laboratories Inc, Edgewood, Md). Main Outcome Measure Hemoglobin A1c levels before and after 90 days of therapy. There were 4 withdrawals from the glucosamine-treated group. Three were related to comorbidities (myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, and atrial fibrillation) and 1 to a possible adverse reaction (excessive flatus). No other patient reported any adverse effects of glucosamine therapy, and no patient had any change in their diabetes management. Mean hemoglobin A1c concentrations were not significantly different between groups prior to glucosamine therapy. Posttreatment hemoglobin A1c concentrations were not significantly different between groups, nor were there any significant differences within groups before and after treatment. This study demonstrates that oral glucosamine supplementation does not result in clinically significant alterations in glucose metabolism in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.",One double-blinded randomized controlled trials evaluated whether oral glucosamine supplementation altered glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) concentrations for patients with well-controlled diabetes mellitus. Thirty-eight patients were randomized to receive either treatment with glucosamine/chondroitin at the recommended doses or placebo. After 3 months of treatment HbA1c levels did not change and were not significantly different between groups (P=.2).
"What are the best prophylactic drugs for migraine
To evaluate the efficacy of oral treatment with nebivolol and metoprolol in the prophylaxis of migraine attacks. Beta-blockers such as propranolol and metoprolol are known to be effective in preventing migraine attacks. Following earlier observations of successful use of nebivolol in a few hypertensive patients with concomitant migraine, we conducted a prospective study to ascertain whether nebivolol would be effective and better tolerated, in a methodologically strict, randomized and double-blind setting. Randomized, double-blind study in 30 patients with confirmed migraine diagnosis, a minimum 1-year history, onset prior to 50 years of age, written records of attacks for the previous 3 months, and minimum 2 attacks per month. Primary endpoint was frequency of attacks (prevention of migraine attacks) in the final 4 weeks of a 14-week treatment on full dose of metoprolol and nebivolol. Secondary endpoints were time to therapeutic effect, duration of attacks, intensity of headache, consumption of analgesics, evaluation of accompanying symptoms, migraine disability assessment, clinical global impression, quality of life, and responder rates. The statistical analysis was prospectively planned and conducted for all randomized patients. Both metoprolol and nebivolol where similarly effective regarding the main endpoint (prevention of migraine attacks) as well as the secondary ones, and both had a fast onset of action, typically within 4 weeks from starting therapy, with responder rates increasing relatively little over time after the first 4 weeks. Use of acute pain medication decreased on both drugs, as well as accompanying symptoms. Both patients' and physicians' evaluations of disability and disease status were similarly favorable to the 2 treatments. Regarding safety, nebivolol was considerably better tolerated than metoprolol in terms of all reported events, treatment-related events, and event severity. Our results suggest that nebivolol is as effective as metoprolol in the prophylaxis of migraine attacks, with the advantages of being better tolerated and not requiring up-titration to achieve therapeutic levels. Further and larger trials should be conducted on nebivolol in the prevention of migraine attacks as it may provide an improvement in current migraine prophylaxis with beta-blockers.","A trial comparing metoprolol and nebivolol demonstrated a positive response-defined as a 50% reduction in headache frequency-to each drug at 14 weeks (57% of metoprolol-treated and 50% of nebivolol-treated patients), but noted that nebivolol was better tolerated."
"What are the best treatments for herpes labialis
To compare the safety and efficacy of topical 1% penciclovir cream with vehicle control cream (placebo) for the treatment of a recurrent episode of herpes simplex labialis (cold sores) in immunocompetent patients. Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, patient-initiated, 2-armed, parallel clinical trial. Patients were prospectively dispensed study medication, and treatment was self-initiated by the patient within 1 hour of the first sign or symptom of a recurrence. A total of 31 ambulatory clinics in the United States in a variety of settings, including private practices, public health facilities, and universities. Otherwise healthy individuals with a history of frequent episodes of herpes simplex labialis. A total of 2209 patients were enrolled and given study medication, and 1573 initiated treatment for a recurrence. Topical 1% penciclovir cream or vehicle control cream. Subjects applied treatment every 2 hours while awake for 4 consecutive days. Lesion healing was the primary efficacy variable. Secondary end points included time to loss of lesion pain and time to cessation of viral shedding. Healing of classical lesions (vesicles, ulcers, and/or crusts) was 0.7 day faster for penciclovir-treated patients compared with those who received vehicle control cream (median, 4.8 days vs 5.5 days; hazard ratio [HR], 1.33; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.18-1.49; P<.001). Pain (median, 3.5 days vs 4.1 days; HR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.09-1.36; P<.001) and lesion virus shedding (median, 3 days vs 3 days; HR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.10-1.64; P=.003) also resolved more quickly for penciclovir-treated patients compared with patients who applied the vehicle control. The efficacy of penciclovir cream was apparent when therapy was initiated early (prodrome or erythema lesion stage) and when initiated late (papule or vesicle stage). The incidence of adverse events was comparable between penciclovir and placebo groups. Penciclovir cream is the first treatment to clearly demonstrate an impact on the course of recurrent herpes labialis in immunocompetent patients. Efficacy was seen in all clinical and laboratory measures of the disease (lesion healing, pain resolution, and cessation of viral shedding). Faster healing and pain resolution occurred both among patients who first applied penciclovir cream in the prodrome and erythema stages and among those who started treatment in the papule and vesicle lesion stages.","Topical penciclovir 1% cream decreases the duration of lesion healing and pain compared with a vehicle control, as shown by 2 RCTs (n=3057, 1573). Patients initiated self-treatment every 2 hours during waking hours for 4 days. In one RCT, the treatment patients lost classic lesions 31% faster than the placebo group. In another trial, healing of classical lesions was faster by 0.7 days (4.8 vs 5.5). Benefits were achieved in both the early (P=.001) and later stages (P=.0055) of recurrence."
"Which blood tests are most helpful in evaluating pelvic inflammatory disease
--To examine the accuracy of existing diagnostic indicators for pelvic inflammatory disease and to develop guidelines for a new diagnostic model. --Studies were identified for the period 1969 through 1990. A Medline search of the English-language literature was conducted using the subject terms pelvic inflammatory disease or salpingitis and diagnosis. In addition, abstracts and bibliographies of articles and books were reviewed. --Studies were selected if pelvic inflammatory disease was diagnosed using laparoscopic findings or narrow clinical rules. Of the 15 reports identified, 12 were included in this analysis. The selected studies were grouped by a quality rating based on subject selection, definition of pelvic inflammatory disease, data analysis, and other measures. --Diagnostic findings were divided into four categories: historical (symptoms), clinical examination (signs), laboratory, and combinations of the above. Sensitivity and specificity were extracted using raw data. Data were classified by quality rating. --Historical findings were usually not statistically significant predictors of pelvic inflammatory disease, and when they were they tended toward low sensitivity and high specificity, while clinical findings were somewhat more sensitive and about as specific. Several laboratory tests showed consistent value in pelvic inflammatory disease diagnosis, with high sensitivity and specificity. Combinations of indicators permitted high sensitivity or high specificity but not both simultaneously. --No single or combination diagnostic indicator was found to reliably predict pelvic inflammatory disease. Combining published evidence with practical clinical considerations, a diagnostic approach is proposed that emphasizes diagnostic sensitivity when clinical presentation is mild and more thorough evaluation when a woman is severely ill. Research is needed to evaluate the accuracy and acceptability of specific diagnostic models and to investigate new diagnostic indicators.",A meta-analysis from 1991 assessed the laboratory criteria for the diagnosis of PID. No single or combination diagnostic indicator was found to reliably predict PID.
"Can you differentiate bacterial from viral pediatric infections based on the CBC
The use of neutrophil left-shift parameters in the diagnosis of inflammatory and infective disease (ID) was evaluated. The level of C-reactive protein (CRP), currently the best quantitative parameter of inflammation, was used as the gold standard. Of 292 patients, 230 (79%) had a level of CRP of 1.0 mg/dL or greater and were classified as having inflammation, whereas 62 (21%) had normal levels. The neutrophil band count in each patient was determined by microscopic examination of 200 WBCs. The diagnostic value of the band count as an indicator for ID was evaluated in comparison to the WBC count, the neutrophil count, and the left-shift indicators of two automated hematologic analyzers, H*1 Technicon (Bayer Technicon Instruments, Tarrytown, NY) and Coulter MAX M (Coulter Electronics, Hialeah, Fla). When receiver operating characteristics were used, the band count was superior to the immature to total neutrophil count (I/T) ratio, the total WBC count, and the neutrophil count. The sensitivity and specificity in identifying ID at designated cutoff points were as follows: band count of 20% or greater of total WBC count (53% and 79%, respectively), I/T ratio of 0.25 or greater (59% and 63%), total WBC count of 9.6 x 10(6)/mL or greater (68% and 56%), and neutrophil count of 8.0 x 10(6)/mL or greater (60% and 58%). The performance of the H*1 Technicon left-shift flag was similar but slightly inferior to the band count (sensitivity, 44%; specificity, 79%), whereas the Coulter MAX M flags had a clearly higher sensitivity (79%) and lower specificity (53%). In addition, microscopic evaluation to determine the presence of reactive morphologic changes in neutrophils, such as toxic granules, Döhle bodies, and cytoplasmic vacuoles, had a high sensitivity (80%) but a low specificity (58%) in predicting ID. The diagnostic value of both microscopic and automated neutrophil left-shift parameters as indicators for ID is limited. Morphologic changes in neutrophils, however, either have a high specificity (band count) or a high sensitivity (toxic signs) in predicting ID and therefore may be a clinically useful tool.","Current literature does not support the premise that for acutely febrile patients, the presence of an elevated white blood cell (WBC) count with elevated band forms has dogmatically been thought of as a marker for bacterial infection."
"What's the best way to manage athletes with amenorrhea
Chronic energy deficit is one of the strongest factors contributors to exercise-induced menstrual dysfunction. In such cases, macro- and micronutrient intakes may also be low. This study presents the results of a diet and exercise training intervention program. designed to reverse athletic amenorrhea, on improving energy balance and nutritional status in 4 amenorrheic athletes. The 20-week program provided a daily sport nutrition supplement and 1 day of rest/week. The program increased protein intakes for the 3 athletes with a protein deficit to within the recommended levels for active individuals. Micronutrient intakes increased, as did serum concentrations of vitamin B12, folate, zinc, iron, and ferritin. These results indicate that some amenorrheic athletes have poor nutritional status due to restricted EIs and poor food selections. A sport nutrition supplement may improve energy balance and nutritional status in active amenorrheic women.","A 1999 study in the International Journal of Sport Nutrition found that chronic energy deficit in amenorrheic athletes (N=4) could be reversed in a 20-week program using a sport nutrition supplement, 1 rest day per week, and a dietician to help with food selection."
"Does reducing smoking in the home protect children from the effects of second-hand smoke
To examine the long-term maintenance of a previously reported behavioral counseling intervention to reduce asthmatic children's exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS). Families of asthmatic children (6 to 17 years), including at least one parent who smoked in the home, recruited from four pediatric allergy clinics. Participants were randomized to one of three groups: behavioral counseling to reduce ETS exposure, self-monitoring control, and usual medical care control. Counseling concluded at month 6, and the original trial ended at month 12. Two follow-up interviews occurred at months 20 and 30. The originally reported analysis of baseline to 12 months was reanalyzed with a more robust restricted maximum likelihood procedure. The 2-year follow-up period was analyzed similarly. Significantly greater change occurred in the counseling group than the control groups and was sustained throughout the 2 years of follow-up. Further exploratory analyses suggested that printed counseling materials given to all participants at month 12 (conclusion of the original study) were associated with decreased exposure in the control groups. Such long-term maintenance of behavior change is highly unusual in the general behavioral science literature, let alone for addictive behaviors. We conclude that ETS exposure can be reduced and that a clinician-delivered treatment may provide substantial benefit.","A trial that measured changes in urine cotinine randomized 91 families with a smoking parent and an asthmatic child into 3 groups: A control group received usual care (regular office visits at an asthma clinic and medication management); A monitoring group used a parental smoking diary and a children's asthma symptom diary; And a counseling group received 5 counseling sessions and also kept diaries. An environmental monitor in the home was used to assess exposure to secondhand smoke. In the counseling group, 21.4% of patients (6 of 28) maintained 0% exposure throughout the 30-month trial period compared with 3.6% and 3.8% in the monitoring and control groups, respectively (P<.05 for comparison of counseling group to monitoring and control)."
"What is the best treatment for gastroesophageal reflux and vomiting in infants
The aim of the present study was to compare the efficacy and safety of a new aluminium-free formulation of alginate with placebo in infants with recurrent gastro-oesophageal reflux. This was a double-blind, randomised, parallel-group study conducted at 25 centres in the UK. Of the 90 paediatric patients recruited in a general practice setting, 42 were randomised to receive alginate and 48 to receive placebo. Infants were assessed before treatment and again after seven and 14 days of treatment. Analyses were based on the last, valid, non-missing observation for each variable for the intent-to-treat (ITT) population of 42 alginate and 46 placebo patients. For the primary efficacy measure (number of vomitting/regurgitation episodes), alginate was significantly superior to placebo (p = 0.009). For the secondary efficacy measure (severity of vomiting), a trend in favour of alginate was observed (p = 0.061). Patients receiving alginate achieved superior assessments of treatment outcome by both investigators (p = 0.008) and parent/guardians (p = 0.002) alike. In addition, alginate achieved a significantly greater reduction in the mean severity of vomiting episodes recorded in a daily diary compared with placebo (p = 0.027) and resulted in more patients having at least 10% symptom-free days (p = 0.027). For none of the variables measured did placebo have a superior effect. More than one-half of all patients experienced some adverse event, although no statistically significant differences were observed between the two treatment groups (p > 0.1), and adverse events accounted for withdrawal in only 12.5% of the patients (alginate, n = 4; placebo, n = 7). Aluminium-free alginate demonstrated superior efficacy over placebo in treating recurrent gastro-oesophageal reflux in paediatric patients. The safety profile of alginate was similar to that of placebo.","A large manufacturer-sponsored randomized controlled trials found that sodium alginate significantly reduced emesis episodes in treated infants. Sodium alginate is marketed in the UK as Gaviscon Infant. While this trial included breastfed infants, it did not report the numbers of breastfed infants in the 2 treatment groups or present data separately for breastfed infants."
"Do hyaluronic acid injections relieve OA knee pain
Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most prevalent chronic joint disorder worldwide and is associated with significant pain and disability. To assess the effects of viscosupplementation in the treatment of OA of the knee. The products were hyaluronan and hylan derivatives (Adant, Arthrum H, Artz (Artzal, Supartz), BioHy (Arthrease, Euflexxa, Nuflexxa), Durolane, Fermathron, Go-On, Hyalgan, Hylan G-F 20 (Synvisc Hylan G-F 20), Hyruan, NRD-101 (Suvenyl), Orthovisc, Ostenil, Replasyn, SLM-10, Suplasyn, Synject and Zeel compositum). MEDLINE (up to January (week 1) 2006 for update), EMBASE, PREMEDLINE, Current Contents up to July 2003, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) were searched. Specialised journals and reference lists of identified randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and pertinent review articles up to December 2005 were handsearched. RCTs of viscosupplementation for the treatment of people with a diagnosis of OA of the knee were eligible. Single and double-blinded studies, placebo-based and comparative studies were eligible. At least one of the four OMERACT III core set outcome measures had to be reported (Bellamy 1997). Each trial was assessed independently by two reviewers for its methodological quality using a validated tool. All data were extracted by one reviewer and verified by a second reviewer . Continuous outcome measures were analysed as weighted mean differences (WMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). However, where different scales were used to measure the same outcome, standardized mean differences (SMD) were used. Dichotomous outcomes were analyzed by relative risk (RR). Seventy-six trials with a median quality score of 3 (range 1 to 5) were identified. Follow-up periods varied between day of last injection and eighteen months. Forty trials included comparisons of hyaluronan/hylan and placebo (saline or arthrocentesis), ten trials included comparisons of intra-articular (IA) corticosteroids, six trials included comparisons of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), three trials included comparisons of physical therapy, two trials included comparisons of exercise, two trials included comparisons of arthroscopy, two trials included comparisons of conventional treatment, and fifteen trials included comparisons of other hyaluronans/hylan. The pooled analyses of the effects of viscosupplements against 'placebo' controls generally supported the efficacy of this class of intervention. In these same analyses, differential efficacy effects were observed for different products on different variables and at different timepoints. Of note is the 5 to 13 week post injection period which showed a percent improvement from baseline of 28 to 54% for pain and 9 to 32% for function. In general, comparable efficacy was noted against NSAIDs and longer-term benefits were noted in comparisons against IA corticosteroids. In general, few adverse events were reported in the hyaluronan/hylan trials included in these analyses. Based on the aforementioned analyses, viscosupplementation is an effective treatment for OA of the knee with beneficial effects: on pain, function and patient global assessment; and at different post injection periods but especially at the 5 to 13 week post injection period. It is of note that the magnitude of the clinical effect, as expressed by the WMD and standardised mean difference (SMD) from the RevMan 4.2 output, is different for different products, comparisons, timepoints, variables and trial designs. However, there are few randomised head-to-head comparisons of different viscosupplements and readers should be cautious, therefore, in drawing conclusions regarding the relative value of different products. The clinical effect for some products, against placebo, on some variables at some timepoints is in the moderate to large effect-size range. Readers should refer to relevant tables to review specific detail given the heterogeneity in effects across the product class and some discrepancies observed between the RevMan 4.2 analyses and the original publications. Overall, the analyses performed are positive for the HA class and particularly positive for some products with respect to certain variables and timepoints, such as pain on weight bearing at 5 to 13 weeks postinjection. In general, sample-size restrictions preclude any definitive comment on the safety of the HA class of products; however, within the constraints of the trial designs employed no major safety issues were detected. In some analyses viscosupplements were comparable in efficacy to systemic forms of active intervention, with more local reactions but fewer systemic adverse events. In other analyses HA products had more prolonged effects than IA corticosteroids. Overall, the aforementioned analyses support the use of the HA class of products in the treatment of knee OA.","The comprehensive 2006 Cochrane meta-analysis reviewed single- and double-blinded RCTs that evaluated the effect of 12 HA products on osteoarthritis of the knee.3 Studies compared HA products with placebo (40), intra-articular steroids (10), NSAIDs (6), physical therapy (3), exercise (2), and each other (15). Efficacy data for different products could not be combined because the studies measured different sets of outcomes at different time points. Overall, the authors concluded that HA injections effectively reduced pain scores, with the largest benefit occurring within 5 to 13 weeks. The authors also noted that the reductions in pain with HA injections, although generally small, were comparable to oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs therapy and intra-articular corticosteroids. The trials reported few adverse events."
"What is the best treatment for pertussis
Whooping cough is a highly contagious disease. Infants are the population at highest risk of severe disease and death. Erythromycin for 14 days is recommended for treatment and contact prophylaxis but this regime is considered inconvenient and prolonged. The value of contact prophylaxis is uncertain. To study the benefits and risks of antibiotic treatment of and contact prophylaxis against whooping cough. The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2004); MEDLINE (January 1966 to February 2004); EMBASE (January 1974 to August 2003); conference abstracts and reference lists of articles were searched. Study investigators and pharmaceutical companies were approached for additional information (published or unpublished studies). There were no constraints based on language or publication status. All randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials of antibiotics for treatment of and contact prophylaxis against whooping cough were included in the systematic review. At least three reviewers independently extracted data and assessed the quality of each trial. Twelve trials with 1,720 participants met the inclusion criteria. Ten trials investigated treatment regimens and two investigated prophylaxis regimens. The quality of the trials was variable. Results showed that short-term antibiotics (azithromycin for three days, clarithromycin for seven days, or erythromycin estolate for seven days) were equally effective with long-term antibiotic treatment (erythromycin estolate or erythromycin for 14 days) in the microbiological eradication of Bordetella pertussis (B. pertussis) from the nasopharynx. The relative risk (RR) was 1.02 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.98 to 1.05). Side effects were fewer with short-term treatment (RR 0.66; 95% CI 0.52 to 0.83). There were no differences in clinical improvement or microbiological relapse between short and long-term treatment regimens. Contact prophylaxis (of contacts older than six months of age) with antibiotics did not significantly improve clinical symptoms or the number of cases that developed culture positive B. pertussis. Antibiotics are effective in eliminating B. pertussis from patients with the disease, rendering them non-infectious, but do not alter the subsequent clinical course of the illness. Effective regimens include: three days of azithromycin, seven days of clarithromycin, seven or 14 days of erythromycin estolate, and 14 days of erythromycin ethylsuccinate. Considering microbiological clearance and side effects, three days of azithromycin or seven days of clarithromycin are the best regimens. Seven days of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole also appeared to be effective for the eradication of B. pertussis from the nasopharynx and may serve as an alternative antibiotic treatment for patients who cannot tolerate a macrolide. There is insufficient evidence to determine the benefit of prophylactic treatment of pertussis contacts.","Although tetracycline and chloramphenicol are effective treatments for pertussis, they are not recommended because of their side effects."
"Do hyaluronic acid injections relieve OA knee pain
To compare the safety and effectiveness of a high molecular weight hyaluronan produced by biological fermentation (Bio-HA) with those of avian-derived hyaluronan that uses cross-linking to achieve high molecular weight (CL-HA). This was a prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial evaluating patients with confirmed osteoarthritis of the knee. The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC Index) pain subscale was the primary effectiveness measure (visual analog scale). Both products were administered via three weekly injections, with follow-up evaluations at weeks 3, 6 and 12. Acetaminophen was permitted as rescue medication and quantitated by pill counts. Analyses were performed on the intent-to-treat population, defined as all patients receiving at least one injection. Of the 321 patients randomized to treatment, 314 patients (98%) completed the final study assessment. Improvement in the average WOMAC Index pain score was 29.8mm (-61.6%) for Bio-HA and 28.8mm (-54.9%) for CL-HA, meeting the prospective criteria for non-inferiority. For the secondary outcome measures, statistically significant differences favored Bio-HA for the number of patients requiring acetaminophen (P=0.013) and patient global satisfaction evaluations (P=0.03). Local reactions differed between the products in that 15 effusions were reported in 13 CL-HA patients (8.1%) after injection, compared to one effusion (0.6%) after Bio-HA injection (P=0.0015). The effectiveness of Bio-HA was not inferior to that of CL-HA. The significantly higher incidence of post-injection effusion in the CL-HA group provides a safety advantage for Bio-HA. These data suggest that Bio-HA has an improved benefit-risk profile compared with CL-HA.","A Cochrane review determined that not enough evidence existed to evaluate HA products against each other. An RCTs compared HA products and found no differences in efficacy. The study compared Synvisc with Euflexxa in 321 patients over 3 months. Notably, 8% of patients in this study who used Synvisc developed an effusion, compared with 0.6% of patients who used Euflexxa (P=.0015)."
"What's the best treatment for sebaceous cysts
The removal of keratinous and pilar cysts by the punch incision technique is an alternative to traditional excision methods. It is easy to perform with commonly available instruments, and quick. Faster healing and less scarring are advantages because of the small opening through which the cysts are removed. No previous studies have documented recurrence rates of cysts removed by this technique or the recurrence rates following either traditional excision surgery or other alternative minimal excision techniques. We provide data demonstrating that the removal of keratinous and pilar cysts by the punch incision technique is a viable option with an acceptably low recurrence rate. To evaluate the overall recurrence rates of keratinous and pilar cysts removed by the punch incision technique and rates of recurrence by location and using other cyst characteristics. A preliminary retrospective chart review of cysts removed exclusively by the punch incision technique from 1989 to 1998 was performed. The rate of cyst recurrence and average time to patient-initiated follow-up visit for evaluation and removal were determined. In a second study, a survey requested information on the presence of cyst recurrence. This was mailed to all 646 patients who had cysts removed by the punch incision technique from 1989 to 1998 to evaluate possible cyst recurrence in patients who did not choose to follow-up at the office. Statistical analysis was performed to determine the overall recurrence rates and recurrence rates based on location and other cyst characteristics. Preliminary chart review revealed a recurrence rate of 3.6%, with a mean time to patient-initiated follow-up of 79.3 weeks. In the second study, an analysis of cyst recurrence rates in patients returning the survey revealed an 8.3% recurrence rate. Subanalysis revealed a trend showing that inflamed cysts had a lower recurrence rate. Another trend noted was that cysts removed from the back and ear had the highest recurrence rates (13.8 and 13.0%, respectively) compared to those removed from other locations. Most cysts (54.5%) recurred within the first year after punch incision removal. This is the first study to document recurrence rates using the punch incision technique for removal of epithelial cysts. Though most recurrences occur within the first year, there is a delay in patients reporting to their doctors for reexcision, perhaps because recurrent cysts are often asymptomatic. Studies to determine the recurrence rates for cyst excision using other techniques should be performed. The punch incision technique, when properly performed, is a satisfactory removal method with a recurrence rate of less then 10%.","Traditional wide excision -involving dissection and removal of the cyst completely from the surrounding tissue through an elliptical incision-is considered the gold standard of treatment. This time-consuming endeavor frequently leads to significant scarring in comparison with minimal excision or punch biopsy, but has almost no recurrence when the cyst wall is entirely removed."
"What is the best initial treatment for orbital cellulitis in children
The authors sought to determine whether the microbiologic spectrum of preseptal and orbital cellulitis had changed over the past decade. A retrospective chart review of all inpatient and outpatient children with an ICD-9 diagnosis of preseptal or orbital cellulitis seen at Vanderbilt University Medical Center since the introduction of the Haemophilus influenzae type-B (HiB) vaccine (1986-1996). Blood and abscess cultures from children with preseptal and orbital cellulitis were tabulated. During this period, 70 cases of preseptal cellulitis were seen. Blood cultures were obtained in 59 cases; only 6 were positive. Five cultures grew Streptococcus species. The one positive H. influenzae culture occurred in 1987 in a child who did not receive the HiB vaccine. There have been no new patients with preseptal cellulitis and H. influenzae bacteremia at Vanderbilt for 10 years. There were ten cases of orbital cellulitis, of which blood or abscess or both were cultured in eight. Six cases had positive cultures. Four cultures grew Streptococcus species. The other two grew H. influenzae and mixed H. influenzae/gram-positive cocci. The incidence of hemophilus-associated bacteremia in patients with preseptal cellulitis has decreased dramatically over the past 10 years. Streptococcus species now are the predominant cause. Orbital cellulitis due to H. influenzae may still occur, but it is much less likely. A more conservative approach to the diagnosis and management of preseptal and orbital cellulitis may be warranted.","A retrospective case series from Vanderbilt (n=80) found streptococci as the most common cause, based on blood and wound cultures in the Hib vaccination era; however, only 12 wounds returned positive cultures."
"Do glucosamine and chondroitin worsen blood sugar control in diabetes
and objective: Glucosamine is suggested to affect glucose transport and insulin resistance. The effects of oral glucosamine on serum glucose and insulin levels at the initiation and throughout the duration of a 3-h oral glucose tolerance test were examined. Sera from 16 patients with osteoarthritis, but with no other diagnosed medical condition who had fasted overnight, were obtained every 15-30 min during the 3 h of continued fasting and during the 3 h after ingestion of 75 g of glucose with or without ingestion of 1500 mg of glucosamine sulphate. Glucose was analysed by high-performance liquid chromatography using a Metrohm-Peak 817 Bioscan, and the area under the curve (AUC) for glucose was calculated. Insulin was measured by radioimmunoassay every 30 min for 2 h. Three participants who were found to have previously undiagnosed abnormalities of glucose tolerance demonstrated significant (p = 0.04) incremental elevations in glucose levels after ingestion of glucosamine sulphate. The other 13 participants also had mean incremental elevations that were not significant (p = 0.20). Glucosamine sulphate ingestion had no effect on insulin levels. The results suggest that glucosamine ingestion may affect glucose levels and consequent glucose uptake in patients who have untreated diabetes or glucose intolerance.",A recent study examined insulin and glucose levels with and without the simultaneous ingestion of 1500 mg of glucosamine. Sixteen fasting volunteers with osteoarthritis but without known diabetes or glucose intolerance received 7 g of glucose with or without ingestion of 1500 mg glucosamine sulfate. The authors unexpectedly uncovered undiagnosed diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance in 3 subjects. These 3 subjects showed a statistically significant (P=.04) 31% increase in the area under the curve of glucose levels following the test. There was no effect of glucosamine sulfate ingestion on patients with normal baseline glucose testing or on insulin levels. Their results might be important since they are the first to suggest that glucosamine ingestion may affect glucose levels in individuals who have untreated diabetes or glucose intolerance.
"How accurate is the use of ECGs in the diagnosis of myocardial infarct
Acute cardiac ischemia (ACI) encompasses the diagnoses of unstable angina pectoris and acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Accurate diagnosis and triage of patients with ACI in the emergency department should increase survival for these patients and reduce unnecessary hospital admissions. We conducted a systematic review of the English-language literature published between 1966 and December 1998 on the accuracy and clinical effect of diagnostic technologies for ACI. We evaluated prospective and retrospective studies of adult patients who presented to the ED with symptoms suggesting ACI. Outcomes were diagnostic performance (test sensitivity and specificity) and measures of clinical effect. Meta-analyses were performed when appropriate. A decision and cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted that investigated various diagnostic strategies used in the diagnosis of ACI in the ED. We screened 6,667 abstracts, reviewed 407 full articles, and included 106 articles articles in the main analysis. Single measurements of biomarkers at presentation to the ED have low sensitivity for AMI, although they have high specificity. Serial measurements greatly increase the sensitivity for AMI while maintaining their excellent specificity. Diagnostic technologies to evaluate ACI in selected populations, such as electrocardiography, sestamibi perfusion imaging, and stress ECG, may have very good to excellent sensitivity; however, they have not been sufficiently studied. The Goldman Chest Pain Protocol has good sensitivity (about 90%) for AMI but has not been shown to result in any differences in hospitalization rate, length of stay, or estimated costs in the single clinical effect study performed. Its applicability to patients with unstable angina pectoris has not been evaluated. The use of an Acute Cardiac Ischemia-Time-Insensitive Predictive Instrument led to the appropriate triage of 97% of patients with ACI presenting to the ED and reduced unnecessary hospitalizations. Many of the current technologies remain underevaluated, especially regarding their clinical effect. The extent to which combinations of tests may provide better accuracy than any single test needs further study.","A systematic review performed by a national heart attack alert program working group evaluating different technologies in the emergency department diagnosis of ACI found only 1 study on the accuracy of serial ECGs in acute myocardial infarction (sensitivity 39%, specificity 88%)."
"What is the best test for peripheral vascular disease
Peripheral vascular disease is a manifestation of systemic atherosclerosis that leads to significant narrowing of arteries distal to the arch of the aorta. The most common symptom of peripheral vascular disease is intermittent claudication. At other times, peripheral vascular disease leads to acute or critical limb ischemia. Intermittent claudication manifests as pain in the muscles of the legs with exercise; it is experienced by 2 percent of persons older than 65 years. Physical findings include abnormal pedal pulses, femoral artery bruit, delayed venous filling time, cool skin, and abnormal skin color. Most patients present with subtle findings and lack classic symptoms, which makes the diagnosis difficult. The standard office-based test to determine the presence of peripheral vascular disease is calculation of the ankle-brachial index. Magnetic resonance arteriography, duplex scanning, and hemodynamic localization are noninvasive methods for lesion localization and may be helpful when symptoms or findings do not correlate with the ankle-brachial index. Contrast arteriography is used for definitive localization before intervention. Treatment is divided into lifestyle, medical, and surgical therapies. Lifestyle therapies focus on exercise, smoking cessation, and dietary modification. Medical therapy is directed at reducing platelet aggregation. In addition, patients with contributing disorders such as hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia need to have these conditions managed as aggressively as possible. Surgical therapies include stents, arterectomies, angioplasty, and bypass surgery.","After balancing the accuracy, cost, and risk of available tests, an appropriate stepwise approach to evaluation for peripheral vascular disease is: First, do a complete history and targeted physical examination (palpation of pulses). Next, obtain an ankle-brachial index to confirm the diagnosis. Then, proceed directly to either duplex ultrasonography or magnetic resonance angiography when revascularization is clearly needed."
"Do antipyretics prolong febrile illness
To determine whether acetaminophen affects the duration or severity of childhood varicella. Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Office- and hospital-based pediatric practices. Seventy-two children between 1 and 12 years of age entered the study. One child was withdrawn because of high fever, and three children did not complete the study; 31 received placebo and 37 received acetaminophen. Acetaminophen, 10 mg/kg/dose, was given at 8 AM, 12 PM, 4 PM, and 8 PM for 4 days. Placebo was given to the control group. Itching, appetite, activity, and overall condition were measured for 6 days. The time to last vesicle formation, time to total scabbing, and time to total healing were measured until complete resolution of the exanthem. The following results were better in the placebo group (p less than .05): time to total scabbing 5.6 days (SD 2.5) versus 6.7 days (SD 2.3) in the acetaminophen group, and itching on day 4 in the placebo group (symptom score 2.9 (SD 0.20) vs 2.2 (SD 0.26]. Activity was better in the acetaminophen group on day 2 (3.13 (SD 0.23) vs 2.82 (SD 0.24]. These results provide evidence that acetaminophen does not alleviate symptoms in children with varicella and may prolong illness.","In a randomized controlled trial evaluating antipyretic effects on the duration or severity of childhood varicella, 31 children received placebo and 37 received acetaminophen for 4 days. There was no difference in itching, appetite, activity, or overall condition between the 2 groups. Children treated with acetaminophen took 1.1 days longer to total scabbing (P<.05), although the number of days until the appearance of the last new vesicle and the time to total healing were unchanged. The duration of viral shedding was not measured, but it is possible that the delay in healing of lesions would prolong viral shedding as well."
"When should you admit a patient with suspected community acquired pneumonia
In the assessment of severity in community acquired pneumonia (CAP), the modified British Thoracic Society (mBTS) rule identifies patients with severe pneumonia but not patients who might be suitable for home management. A multicentre study was conducted to derive and validate a practical severity assessment model for stratifying adults hospitalised with CAP into different management groups. Data from three prospective studies of CAP conducted in the UK, New Zealand, and the Netherlands were combined. A derivation cohort comprising 80% of the data was used to develop the model. Prognostic variables were identified using multiple logistic regression with 30 day mortality as the outcome measure. The final model was tested against the validation cohort. 1068 patients were studied (mean age 64 years, 51.5% male, 30 day mortality 9%). Age >/=65 years (OR 3.5, 95% CI 1.6 to 8.0) and albumin <30 g/dl (OR 4.7, 95% CI 2.5 to 8.7) were independently associated with mortality over and above the mBTS rule (OR 5.2, 95% CI 2.7 to 10). A six point score, one point for each of Confusion, Urea >7 mmol/l, Respiratory rate >/=30/min, low systolic(<90 mm Hg) or diastolic (</=60 mm Hg) Blood pressure), age >/=65 years (CURB-65 score) based on information available at initial hospital assessment, enabled patients to be stratified according to increasing risk of mortality: score 0, 0.7%; score 1, 3.2%; score 2, 3%; score 3, 17%; score 4, 41.5% and score 5, 57%. The validation cohort confirmed a similar pattern. A simple six point score based on confusion, urea, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and age can be used to stratify patients with CAP into different management groups.","In a split-sample (derivation and validation) analysis of 3 prospective studies involving 1068 patients presenting to the hospital with the diagnosis of pneumonia, various clinical features were analyzed for their association with 30-day mortality. The 5 parameters that were most strongly associated with mortality were: acute confusion (odds ratio [OR]=8.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4.8-13.7), blood urea nitrogen >19.6 mg/dL (OR= 5.6; 95% CI, 3.1-10), respiratory rate ≥30 (OR=1.7; 95% CI, 1.07-2.8), low blood pressure (SBP <90 or diastolic blood pressure ≤60) (OR=2.4; 95% CI, 1.4-3.8) and age ≥65 years (OR=5.5; 95% CI, 2.8-10.9). The 30-day mortality estimation using these 5 criteria is called CURB-65 (Confusion, Urea, Respiratory rate, low Blood pressure, and age ≥65). In patients with 2 or more of these factors, the associated rate of mortality increased significantly compared with patients who had none or only 1 of the factors. Although albumin <3.0 g/dL was also significantly associated with an increased mortality rate (OR=4.7; 95% CI, 2.5-8.7), it was not included in CURB-65 because it is not a routine lab ordered for patients with pneumonia. A variation of the CURB-65 score, CRB-65, uses only the clinical parameters without laboratory data (confusion, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and age). Patients with a score of 0 had a 0.9% 30-day mortality rate. However, the rate increased to 8.15% when patients had 1 or 2 of the 4 clinical criteria.."
"How useful are autoantibodies in diagnosing thyroid disorders
The original Whickham Survey documented the prevalence of thyroid disorders in a randomly selected sample of 2779 adults which matched the population of Great Britain in age, sex and social class. The aim of the twenty-year follow-up survey was to determine the incidence and natural history of thyroid disease in this cohort. Subjects were traced at follow-up via the Electoral Register, General Practice registers, Gateshead Family Health Services Authority register and Office of Population Censuses and Surveys. Eight hundred and twenty-five subjects (30% of the sample) had died and, in addition to death certificates, two-thirds had information from either hospital/General Practitioner notes or post-mortem reports to document morbidity prior to death. Of the 1877 known survivors, 96% participated in the follow-up study and 91% were tested for clinical, biochemical and immunological evidence of thyroid dysfunction. Outcomes in terms of morbidity and mortality were determined for over 97% of the original sample. The mean incidence (with 95% confidence intervals) of spontaneous hypothyroidism in women was 3.5/1000 survivors/year (2.8-4.5) rising to 4.1/1000 survivors/year (3.3-5.0) for all causes of hypothyroidism and in men was 0.6/1000 survivors/year (0.3-1.2). The mean incidence of hyperthyroidism in women was 0.8/1000 survivors/year (0.5-1.4) and was negligible in men. Similar incidence rates were calculated for the deceased subjects. An estimate of the probability of the development of hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism at a particular time, i.e. the hazard rate, showed an increase with age in hypothyroidism but no age relation in hyperthyroidism. The frequency of goitre decreased with age with 10% of women and 2% of men having a goitre at follow-up, as compared to 23% and 5% in the same subjects respectively at the first survey. The presence of a goitre at either survey was not associated with any clinical or biochemical evidence of thyroid dysfunction. In women, an association was found between the development of a goitre and thyroid-antibody status at follow-up, but not initially. The risk of having developed hypothyroidism at follow-up was examined with respect to risk factors identified at first survey. The odds ratios (with 95% confidence intervals) of developing hypothyroidism with (a) raised serum TSH alone were 8 (3-20) for women and 44 (19-104) for men; (b) positive anti-thyroid antibodies alone were 8 (5-15) for women and 25 (10-63) for men; (c) both raised serum TSH and positive anti-thyroid antibodies were 38 (22-65) for women and 173 (81-370) for men. A logit model indicated that increasing values of serum TSH above 2mU/l at first survey increased the probability of developing hypothyroidism which was further increased in the presence of anti-thyroid antibodies. Neither a positive family history of any form of thyroid disease nor parity of women at first survey was associated with increased risk of developing hypothyroidism. Fasting cholesterol and triglyceride levels at first survey when corrected for age showed no association with the development of hypothyroidism in women. This historical cohort study has provided incidence data for thyroid disease over a twenty-year period for a representative cross-sectional sample of the population, and has allowed the determination of the importance of prognostic risk factors for thyroid disease identified twenty years earlier.","In the early 1970s, a cohort study of 2779 adults from Great Britain attempted to establish the incidence of thyroid disease in the general population by measuring thyroid-stimulating hormone and TPOAb. Twenty years later, investigators restudied 1708 people from the original sample to determine the incidence of hypothyroidism and the prognostic value of these 2 biochemical markers for its development. At follow-up, the definition of a new case of hypothyroidism was based on an ""intention to treat by the general practitioner by meeting clear biochemical criteria and/or symptoms."" The initial presence of abnormally high serum TPOAb levels and thyroid-stimulating hormone >2.0 mU/L predicted a 4.3% annual risk of developing hypothyroidism compared with a 2.6% annual risk with serum thyroid-stimulating hormone >6.0 mU/L alone in women. This risk was not estimated for men because of the small number of cases."
"Which lifestyle interventions effectively lower low density lipoprotein cholesterol
The aim of this study was to examine whether motivating patients to gain expertise and closely follow their risk parameters will attenuate the course of microvascular and cardiovascular sequelae of diabetes. A randomized, prospective study was conducted of 165 patients who had type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia and were referred for consultation to a diabetes clinic in an academic hospital. Patients were randomly allocated to standard consultation (SC) or to a patient participation (PP) program. Both groups were followed by their primary care physicians. The mean follow-up was 7.7 yr. The SC group attended eight annual consultations. The PP patients initiated on average one additional consultation per year. There were 80 cardiovascular events (eight deaths) in the SC group versus 47 events (five deaths) in the PP group (P = 0.001). The relative risk (RR) over 8 yr for a cardiovascular event in the intervention (PP) versus the control (SC) group was 0.65 (95% confidence interval, 0.89 to 0.41). There were 17 and eight cases of stroke in the SC and PP groups, respectively (P = 0.05). RR for stroke was 0.47 (95% confidence interval, 0.85 to 0.32). In the SC group, 14 patients developed overt nephropathy (four ESRD) versus seven (one ESRD) in the PP group (P = 0.05). Throughout the study period, BP, LDL cholesterol, and hemoglobin A1c were significantly lower in the PP than in the SC patients. Well informed and motivated patients were more successful in obtaining and maintaining good control of their risk factors, resulting in reduced cardiovascular risk and slower progression of microvascular disease.",An randomized controlled trials (N=167) with 8 years of follow-up found that patient education and counseling effectively improved medication adherence.

This paper reviews the health services literature regarding care for gastroenteritis in children. United States health care utilization, use of oral rehydration therapy (ORT), and quality of care considerations are described. The literature suggests that some US children may receive too much care while others may not be getting enough and that physician practices continue to differ from expert recommendations.","Viral causes are most common; in children, viruses are responsible for 70% to 80% of cases of diarrhea."
"How should we manage infants at risk for group B streptococcal disease
The use of intrapartum antibiotics to prevent early-onset group B streptococcal (EOGBS) infection has left pediatricians in a quandary about the appropriate evaluation and treatment of infants at risk for this infection. The aim of this study was to determine whether intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis changed the constellation and timing of onset of clinical signs of group B streptococcal (GBS) infection in term infants. We conducted a retrospective chart review of infants who had EOGBS infection and were born in Southern California Kaiser Permanente Hospitals from 1988 through 1996. Objective criteria were used to ascertain maternal risk of infection, intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis, and onset of clinical signs of infection. Three hundred nineteen infants with EOGBS sepsis, bacteremia, or clinically suspected infection were identified from a population of 277 912 live births. Of the 172 term infants with culture-positive infection who had clinical signs of infection, 95% exhibited them in the first 24 hours of life. All of the infants exposed to intrapartum antibiotics became ill within the first 24 hours of life. Exposure to antibiotics during labor did not change the clinical spectrum of disease or the onset of clinical signs of infection within 24 hours of birth for term infants with EOGBS infection. A 48-hour stay is not required to monitor asymptomatic term infants exposed to intrapartum antibiotics for onset of GBS infection.",A large retrospective study demonstrated that infants who developed early-onset disease despite intrapartum prophylaxis developed the same clinical syndrome in the same time frame (78% of early-onset disease evident in first 24 hours and 96% by 48 hours) as infants whose mothers did not receive prophylaxis.
"What is the best way to diagnose polycystic ovarian syndrome
Since the 1990 National Institutes of Health-sponsored conference on polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), it has become appreciated that the syndrome encompasses a broader spectrum of signs and symptoms of ovarian dysfunction than those defined by the original diagnostic criteria. The 2003 Rotterdam consensus workshop concluded that PCOS is a syndrome of ovarian dysfunction along with the cardinal features hyperandrogenism and polycystic ovary (PCO) morphology. PCOS remains a syndrome, and as such no single diagnostic criterion (such as hyperandrogenism or PCO) is sufficient for clinical diagnosis. Its clinical manifestations may include menstrual irregularities, signs of androgen excess, and obesity. Insulin resistance and elevated serum LH levels are also common features in PCOS. PCOS is associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular events.","Because PCOS is a clinical syndrome, no single diagnostic criterion is sufficient for diagnosis. Clinical features include menstrual irregularities or infertility, hirsutism, male-pattern balding, acne, ovarian enlargement, and signs of insulin resistance (eg, central obesity, acanthosis nigricans). A 2003 international consensus panel concluded that the presence of 2 of 3 criteria (oligo/anovulation, hyperandrogenism, polycystic ovaries), in the absence of other secondary causes, is sufficient to make the diagnosis. A high luteinizing hormone/follicle-stimulating hormone (LH/FSH) ratio supports the diagnosis. However, because this measure varies considerably in relation to ovulation, body-mass index (BMI), and the particular measurement assay used, the consensus panel recommended against its use as a diagnostic criterion."
"Is DEET safe for children
This study analyzed 9,086 human exposures involving N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide--containing insect repellents that were reported to Poison Control Centers from 1985-1989. Nearly two-thirds of those exposed had no adverse effects or only experienced minor symptoms that resolved rapidly. Symptoms were more likely to occur after ocular or inhalation exposures and least likely to occur if the product was ingested. The only reported death occurred in a patient who suicidally ingested 8 oz of an insect repellent containing N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide. Five patients may have experienced a serious or potentially life-threatening effect but the poison center record did not provide unequivocal substantiation of the effect or clearly establish N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide as the causative agent. From the analysis of those patients calling Poison Control Centers, it appears the risk of serious medical effects with the labeled use of N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide-containing insect repellents is low in comparison with its reported annual use by about 30% of Americans. For patients contacting Poison Control Centers, the occurrence of adverse effects appears to be related to the route of exposure rather than age or gender of the patient or the concentration of N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide in the product.","A case series collected poison control center reports during the 1980s. The report concluded that DEET exposure rarely led to adverse effects and that the route of administration (ie, ingestion) was more closely linked to toxicity than age or gender. There were 5 major adverse reactions reported from 9086 exposures to DEET (0.05%); these included hypotension, hypotonic reaction, and syncope, and 1 death (a suicide ingestion)."
"What is the recommended workup for a man with a first urinary tract infection
To determine in a prospective study whether urinary tract infection (UTI) in men younger than 45 years of age is associated with anomalies of the genitourinary tract that necessitate additional urologic evaluation. UTI in young men is uncommon. In these patients, it is customary to follow the same policy as that for children or older men and to routinely perform urologic investigations. Twenty-nine consecutive, otherwise healthy, male patients aged 16 to 45 years (mean 30.5) were hospitalized for a first event of acute UTI. All patients underwent an imaging evaluation, including ultrasonography and intravenous urography. Those with macroscopic hematuria underwent cystoscopy. Uroflowmetry was performed at least 1 month after recovery, and patients with a maximal flow rate of less than 15 mL/s underwent a pressure flow study. Significant urethral stricture was excluded in all patients. Twenty-seven patients (93%) had a postvoid residual urine volume of less than 20 mL, and only two had values of 120 and 200 mL. The imaging and cystoscopic evaluation demonstrated a normal urinary tract in all patients. The maximal urinary flow rate was greater than 15 mL/s in 22 patients (76%) and lower than 15 mL/s in 7 patients (24%). In the latter group, urodynamic investigations, including free flowmetry and/or pressure flow study, revealed normal lower urinary tract function in 6 patients and a bladder outflow obstruction in 1 (3%). A first event of UTI in men younger than 45 years is usually not associated with significant structural or functional urinary tract abnormalities. Therefore, no radiologic, endoscopic, or urodynamic investigation is required.","The incidence in elderly men is high, often attributable to a bladder outflow obstruction. (For this review, the definition of urinary tract infection is limited to bacterial infections of the kidney, ureter, or bladder, and does not include urethritis, epididymitis, prostatitis, or orchitis.)"
"Are ARBs or angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors preferred for nephropathy in diabetes
It is unknown whether either the angiotensin-II-receptor blocker irbesartan or the calcium-channel blocker amlodipine slows the progression of nephropathy in patients with type 2 diabetes independently of its capacity to lower the systemic blood pressure. We randomly assigned 1715 hypertensive patients with nephropathy due to type 2 diabetes to treatment with irbesartan (300 mg daily), amlodipine (10 mg daily), or placebo. The target blood pressure was 135/85 mm Hg or less in all groups. We compared the groups with regard to the time to the primary composite end point of a doubling of the base-line serum creatinine concentration, the development of end-stage renal disease, or death from any cause. We also compared them with regard to the time to a secondary, cardiovascular composite end point. The mean duration of follow-up was 2.6 years. Treatment with irbesartan was associated with a risk of the primary composite end point that was 20 percent lower than that in the placebo group (P=0.02) and 23 percent lower than that in the amlodipine group (P=0.006). The risk of a doubling of the serum creatinine concentration was 33 percent lower in the irbesartan group than in the placebo group (P=0.003) and 37 percent lower in the irbesartan group than in the amlodipine group (P<0.001). Treatment with irbesartan was associated with a relative risk of end-stage renal disease that was 23 percent lower than that in both other groups (P=0.07 for both comparisons). These differences were not explained by differences in the blood pressures that were achieved. The serum creatinine concentration increased 24 percent more slowly in the irbesartan group than in the placebo group (P=0.008) and 21 percent more slowly than in the amlodipine group (P=0.02). There were no significant differences in the rates of death from any cause or in the cardiovascular composite end point. The angiotensin-II-receptor blocker irbesartan is effective in protecting against the progression of nephropathy due to type 2 diabetes. This protection is independent of the reduction in blood pressure it causes.","A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial-IDNT Irbesartan Diabetic Nephropathy Trial-randomized 1715 patients to irbesartan, amlodipine Norvasc, or placebo for a median follow-up of 2.6 years. Each group could also use other conventional antihypertensive therapy but again excluding angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, ARBs, and calcium-channel blockers. Irbesartan reduced progression of nephropathy defined by doubling of the serum creatinine and the onset of end-stage renal disease more effectively than amlodipine NNT=12 or placebo NNT=16. Irbesartan did not decrease cardiovascular mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction, heart failure resulting in hospitalization, neurologic deficit caused by a cerebrovascular event, or above-ankle lower-limb amputation."
"What best prevents exerciseinduced bronchoconstriction for a child with asthma
Nedocromil sodium and sodium cromoglycate inhaled shortly before exercise appear to reduce the severity of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction. There is some debate over which drug may be more effective. The objective of this review was to compare the effects on post-exercise lung function between prophylactic doses of nedocromil sodium (NSG) and sodium cromoglycate (SCG) in persons diagnosed with exercise-induced bronchoconstriction. Randomized controlled trials were identified from the Cochrane Airways Review Group Asthma Register which compiles searches of CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE and CENTRAL, plus hand searches for trials in 20 journals. Bibliographies of relevant studies and review articles were searched and primary authors, content experts and manufacturers of drugs were contacted for additional relevant studies. No language restrictions were applied. Randomized controlled trials comparing NCS to SCG in prophylactic treatment of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction were eligible. Studies were included if: the participants, aged 6 or over, had a confirmed diagnosis of asthma with exercise-induced bronchoconstriction, were subjected to an exercise challenge sufficient to trigger bronchoconstriction, and the measures of lung function were reported as either changes in forced expiratory volume in one second or peak expiratory flow rate. Data extraction and methodological quality assessments were conducted independently by two reviewers using standard forms and validated assessment criteria. In some cases results were extrapolated from graphs. Results from similar studies were pooled and reported as the weighted mean difference (WMD) or odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using the random effects model. Of the 92 citations retrieved from the original search, a total of 8 studies were included in this review (117 participants). No significant difference was noted between NCS and SCG with respect to the maximum percent decrease in FEV1 (WMD = -0.88; 95% CI: -4.50, 2.74), complete protection (i.e. maximum % fall FEV1 still =>10%); OR = 0.95; 95% CI: 0.50 to 1.8, clinical protection (i.e. < 50% improvement over placebo); OR = 0.71; 95% CI: 0.36 to 1.39; unpleasant taste (OR = 6.85; 95% CI: 0.77, 60.73), or sore throat (OR = 3.46; 95% CI: 0.32, 37.48). For these pooled comparisons, no statistically significant heterogeneity was identified. Subgroup analyses based on age, dosage of medications and timing of exercise post-inhalation were consistent with the overall pooled analyses. No significant differences were evident between the effect of NCS and SCG during the immediate post-exercise period in adults and children with EIB with regards to pulmonary function - specifically maximum percent decrease in FEV1, complete protection, clinical protection, or side effects.","Eight RCTs (5 studying children) were included in a systematic review of patients aged >6 years that found no significant difference between nedocromil and cromoglycate with regards to decrease in FEV1, complete protection, clinical protection, or side effects."
"For fibromyalgia, which treatments are the most effective
To systematically review the effectiveness of cyclobenzaprine in the treatment of fibromyalgia. Articles describing randomized, placebo-controlled trials of cyclobenzaprine in people with fibromyalgia were obtained from Medline, EMBase, Psyclit, the Cochrane Library, and Federal Research in Progress Database. Unpublished literature and bibliographies were also reviewed. Outcomes, including global improvement, treatment effects on pain, fatigue, sleep, and tender points over time, were abstracted. Five randomized, placebo-controlled trials were identified. The odds ratio for global improvement with therapy was 3.0 (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.6-5.6) with a pooled risk difference of 0.21 (95% CI 0.09-0.34), which calculates to 4.8 (95% CI 3.0-11) individuals needing treatment for 1 patient to experience symptom improvement. Pain improved early on, but there was no improvement in fatigue or tender points at any time. Cyclobenzaprine-treated patients were 3 times as likely to report overall improvement and to report moderate reductions in individual symptoms, particularly sleep.","A meta-analysis of 5 RCTs on cyclobenzaprine, a muscle relaxant chemically related to TCAs, demonstrated its effect in improving pain and sleep disturbance (NNT=5)."
"Does treatment of acne with Retin A and tetracycline cause adverse effects
The role of laboratory monitoring in patients receiving long-term oral antibiotics for acne vulgaris has not been clearly defined. The purpose of our study was (1) to evaluate the literature for objective evidence on the value of routine laboratory monitoring of the asymptomatic patient receiving oral antibiotics for acne and (2) to determine the utilization of laboratory monitoring of these patients by Connecticut dermatologists. We surveyed Connecticut dermatologists by phone and inquired about the laboratory monitoring performed in patients receiving long-term oral tetracycline, minocycline, or erythromycin for acne. Eight published studies reported a total of 777 patients who had laboratory monitoring at various frequencies while receiving oral antibiotics for acne. Only one adverse drug reaction (ADR) was detected in a patient in whom mild hyperbilirubinemia developed. Of the 75 Connecticut dermatologists who participated in our survey, 48 (64%) perform some laboratory monitoring; 29% do so routinely, and 35% under special circumstances. Our literature review does not support routine laboratory monitoring in all patients who receive long-term oral antibiotics for acne; rarely does such screening detect an ADR and thus does not justify the cost of such testing. A relatively small proportion of Connecticut dermatologists check laboratory tests more frequently than appears necessary; in our opinion, laboratory monitoring should be limited to patients who may be at higher risk for an ADR.","A systematic review of 8 studies reported on 777 patients taking antibiotics for acne, and examined the need for laboratory monitoring of long-term tetracycline users, including renal, liver, and blood components. The authors found only 1 adverse drug reaction (mild hyperbilirubinemia). They concluded that routine lab monitoring for all patients on long-term antibiotics for acne rarely detects clinically concerning adverse drug reactions and would be cost-prohibitive."
"What is the best way to identify patients with white-coat hypertension
Hypertension guidelines recommend 24 h ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) monitoring in hypertensive subjects with suspected isolated clinic hypertension (ICH). However, the pre-test probability of ICH based on the distribution of its independent predictors has not yet been estimated in hypertensive subjects with mildly elevated blood pressure. To ascertain the independent predictors of ICH in mildly hypertensive subjects. In the setting of the HARVEST-PIUMA collaboration, we studied 1564 subjects with hypertension stage I. At entry, all subjects were untreated and all underwent ABP monitoring and echocardiography. Diabetes, hypertension grade > I, renal failure or previous cardiovascular morbid events were exclusion criteria. Clinic BP was 143/92 mmHg (SD 9/5) and 24 h ABP was 128/81 mmHg (SD 10/8). Prevalence of ICH (daytime ABP < 130 mmHg systolic and 80 mmHg diastolic) was 10.4%. In a multivariate logistic regression analysis, sex (P = 0.002), smoking (P = 0.038) and clinic diastolic BP (P = 0.0002) were the sole independent predictors of ICH according to the following equation: Y = 2.6438 + 0.5128 x sex (0 = men; 1 = women) + 0.4543 x current smoking (0 = yes; 1 = no) - 0.0531 x clinic diastolic BP (mmHg) and P (probability of ICH) = exp(Y)/[1 + (exp(Y)]. Left ventricular (LV) mass at echocardiography was a further independent predictor (P = 0.002) of ICH according to the following equation: Y= 3.4343 + 0.4603 x sex + 0.5989 x current smoking - 0.0482 x clinic diastolic BP - 0.0312 x LV mass [g/height (m)2.7]. LV mass was greater (P < 0.01) in the group with ambulatory hypertension [42.3 g/height (m)2.7] than in that with ICH [39.2 g/height (m)2.7] and not dissimilar between the ICH group and a control group of 370 healthy normotensive subjects [38.1 g/height (m)2.7]. In untreated subjects with stage I hypertension, ICH is most frequent among women, nonsmokers and subjects with low clinic BP and smaller LV mass. These findings allow identification of subjects with indication to ABP monitoring because of suspected ICH.","In a joint multivariate analysis of 2 cohort studies, which enrolled 1564 subjects with uncomplicated stage I hypertension, white-coat hypertension was associated with lower office systolic blood pressure, female gender, and nonsmoking."
"What vitamins and minerals should be given to breastfed and bottle-fed infants
Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) remains the most prevalent nutritional deficiency in infants worldwide. The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy of daily and weekly iron supplementation for 3 months to improve the iron status in 4-month-old, exclusively breast-fed healthy infants. Infants 4 months of age were eligible for the open, randomized controlled trial if their mothers intended to continue exclusive breast-feeding until the infants were 6 months of age. Infants or mothers with iron deficiency (ID) or IDA on admission were excluded. The infants (n = 79) were randomly assigned to three groups, the first group receiving daily (1 mg/kg daily), the second group weekly (7 mg/kg weekly), and the third group no iron supplementation. Anthropometric measurements were taken on admission and at 6 and 7 months of age. Iron status was analyzed on admission and monthly for 3 months. Both hematologic parameters and anthropometric measurements were found to be similar among the three groups during the study period. Seven infants (31.8%) in the control group, six (26.0%) in the daily group, and three (13.6%) in the weekly group developed ID or IDA (P > 0.05). Infants whose mothers had ID or IDA during the study period were more likely to develop ID or IDA independently from iron supplementation. Serum ferritin levels decreased between 4 and 6 months of age in the control and daily groups; the weekly group showed no such decrease. In all groups, the mean levels of serum ferritin were significantly increased from 6 months to 7 months of age during the weaning period. In this study, which had a limited number of cases, weekly or daily iron supplementation was not found to decrease the likelihood of IDA. In conclusion, exclusively breast-fed infants with maternal IDA appeared to be at increased risk of developing IDA.","A randomized controlled trial investigated the efficacy of daily and weekly iron supplementation on iron status in 67 exclusively breastfed infants. At age 4 months the infants were randomized into 3 groups: daily iron, weekly iron, and no iron. No significant differences were detected in the mean weight, height, and head circumference among the groups. The mean values of hemoglobin, mean corpuscular volume, serum iron, and transferrin saturation were similar among all the groups at ages 5, 6, and 7 months."
"Are ARBs or angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors preferred for nephropathy in diabetes
Diabetic nephropathy is the leading cause of end-stage renal disease. Interruption of the renin-angiotensin system slows the progression of renal disease in patients with type 1 diabetes, but similar data are not available for patients with type 2, the most common form of diabetes. We assessed the role of the angiotensin-II-receptor antagonist losartan in patients with type 2 diabetes and nephropathy. A total of 1513 patients were enrolled in this randomized, double-blind study comparing losartan (50 to 100 mg once daily) with placebo, both taken in addition to conventional antihypertensive treatment (calcium-channel antagonists, diuretics, alpha-blockers, beta-blockers, and centrally acting agents), for a mean of 3.4 years. The primary outcome was the composite of a doubling of the base-line serum creatinine concentration, end-stage renal disease, or death. Secondary end points included a composite of morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular causes, proteinuria, and the rate of progression of renal disease. A total of 327 patients in the losartan group reached the primary end point, as compared with 359 in the placebo group (risk reduction, 16 percent; P=0.02). Losartan reduced the incidence of a doubling of the serum creatinine concentration (risk reduction, 25 percent; P=0.006) and end-stage renal disease (risk reduction, 28 percent; P=0.002) but had no effect on the rate of death. The benefit exceeded that attributable to changes in blood pressure. The composite of morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular causes was similar in the two groups, although the rate of first hospitalization for heart failure was significantly lower with losartan (risk reduction, 32 percent; P=0.005). The level of proteinuria declined by 35 percent with losartan (P<0.001 for the comparison with placebo). Losartan conferred significant renal benefits in patients with type 2 diabetes and nephropathy, and it was generally well tolerated.","The RENAAL Reduction of Endpoints in non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus with the Angiotensin II Antagonist Losartan study-a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial-followed 1513 patients with type 2 diabetes and nephropathy over a mean of 3.4 years. Patients were randomized to receive losartan Cozaar or placebo, both taken in addition to conventional anti-hypertensive therapy but not including renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system antagonist medications. The primary outcome was a composite of a doubling of serum creatinine, end-stage renal disease, or death. The number needed to treat number needed to treat for the composite outcome was 34. The number needed to treat for a doubling of the serum creatinine was 25, and for end-stage renal disease was 17."
"Do antipyretics prolong febrile illness
To determine whether antipyretic therapy prolongs the course of experimental influenza A, Shigella sonnei, and Rickettsia rickettsii infections. Retrospective observational study. University Center for Vaccine Development. Fifty-four volunteers with experimentally induced influenza A, 45 with S. sonnei, and 21 with R. rickettsii infections participated. Subjects from the six influenza A studies were challenged intranasally. If they met certain criteria, they were offered aspirin or acetaminophen for symptomatic relief. Subjects from the three Shigella studies were challenged with the bacteria and then given trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole. Acetaminophen also could be administered. In the one R. rickettsii trial, subjects were inoculated intradermally and treated with tetracycline. Again, acetaminophen was administered for symptomatic relief. Data, excerpted from subjects' study records, were evaluated using Wilcoxon tests, Spearman's correlation coefficients, and multiple regression analysis. Two-tailed hypotheses with a p value of 0.05 were used for all of the analyses. There was a striking correlation between antipyretic therapy and duration of illness in subjects infected with influenza A and S. sonnei, but not R. rickettsii. Multivariate analysis suggested that antipyretic therapy prolonged illness in subjects infected with influenza A, but its use was the result of prolonged illness in those infected with S. sonnei. The precise nature of these relationships requires a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled trial.","A retrospective observational study of 54 volunteers demonstrated prolonged illness in subjects infected with influenza A that received antipyretic therapy. Patients who got antipyretics were sick 3.5 days longer than those who did not (8.8 ± 2.3 days vs 5.3 ± 3.0 days; P<.001). Only patients with temperatures >38.9ºC on 2 readings 6 hours apart received antipyretics, indicating that the longer course correlated with greater severity of illness as well as with antipyretic use."
"What is the best diagnostic approach to alopecia in women
To describe an organized diagnostic approach for both nonscarring and scarring alopecias to help family physicians establish an accurate in-office diagnosis. To explain when ancillary laboratory workup is necessary to confirm the diagnosis. Current diagnostic and therapeutic interventions for hair loss are based on randomized controlled studies, uncontrolled studies, and case series. MEDLINE was searched from January 1966 to December 1998 with the MeSH words alopecia, hair, and alopecia areata. Articles were selected on the basis of experimental design, with priority given to the most current large multicentre controlled studies. Overall global evidence for therapeutic intervention for hair loss is quite strong. The most common forms of nonscarring alopecias are androgenic alopecia, telogen effluvium, and alopecia areata. Other disorders include trichotillomania, traction alopecia, tinea capitis, and hair shaft abnormalities. Scarring alopecia is caused by trauma, infections, discoid lupus erythematosus, or lichen planus. Key to establishing an accurate diagnosis is a detailed history, including medication use, systemic illnesses, endocrine dysfunction, hair-care practices, and family history. All hair-bearing sites should be examined. A 4-mm punch biopsy of the scalp is useful, particularly to diagnose scarring alopecias. Once a diagnosis has been established, specific therapy can be initiated. Diagnosis and management of hair loss is an interesting challenge for family physicians. An organized approach to recognizing characteristic differential features of hair loss disorders is key to diagnosis and management.","A detailed history-including medication use, systemic illness, endocrine dysfunction, hair care practices, severe diet restriction, and family history-is key to establishing an accurate diagnosis of alopecia."
"How should thyroid replacement be initiated
Standard therapy for patients with primary hypothyroidism is replacement with synthetic thyroxine, which undergoes peripheral conversion to triiodothyronine, the active form of thyroid hormone. Within the lay population and in some medical communities, there is a perception that adding synthetic triiodothyronine, or liothyronine, to levothyroxine improves the symptoms of hypothyroidism despite insufficient evidence to support this practice. To evaluate the benefits of treating primary hypothyroidism with levothyroxine plus liothyronine combination therapy vs levothyroxine monotherapy. Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted from May 2000 to February 2002 at a military treatment facility that serves active duty and retired military personnel and their family members. The trial included a total of 46 patients aged 24 to 65 years with at least a 6-month history of treatment with levothyroxine for primary hypothyroidism. Patients received either their usual dose of levothyroxine (n = 23) or combination therapy (n = 23), in which their usual levothyroxine dose was reduced by 50 micro g/d and substituted with liothyronine, 7.5 micro g, taken twice daily for 4 months. Scores on a hypothyroid-specific health-related quality-of-life (HRQL) questionnaire, body weight, serum lipid levels, and 13 neuropsychological tests measured before and after treatment. Serum thyrotropin levels remained similar and within the normal range in both treatment groups from baseline to 4 months. Body weight and serum lipid levels did not change. The HRQL questionnaire scores improved significantly in both the control group (23%; P<.001) and the combination therapy group (12%; P =.02), but these changes were statistically similar (P =.54). In 12 of 13 neuropsychological tests, outcomes between groups were not significantly different; the 1 remaining test (Grooved Peg Board) showed better performance in the control group. Compared with levothyroxine alone, treatment of primary hypothyroidism with combination levothyroxine plus liothyronine demonstrated no beneficial changes in body weight, serum lipid levels, hypothyroid symptoms as measured by a HRQL questionnaire, and standard measures of cognitive performance.","A study assessed changes in body weight, lipid profile, hypothyroid-specific health-related quality-of-life scores, and 13 neuropsychological measures pre- and posttreatment. This study detected no difference in body weight and serum lipids at baseline and after treatment. The hypothyroid-specific health-related quality-of-life scores similarly improved for both treatment groups. Twelve of 13 neuropsychological tests demonstrated no differences between treatment groups; the Grooved Peg Board Test of manual dexterity and fine visual-motor coordination demonstrated a slight improvement for the LT4 alone treatment group."
"Menstrual disturbances in perimenopausal women: What's best
This review evaluates the currently available evidence regarding resectoscopic endometrial ablation (REA) and the various nonresectoscopic endometrial ablation (NREA) techniques used for heavy menstrual bleeding. Laser endometrial ablation is now used infrequently, largely because of procedure time, but also because of the cost and training associated with the technique. REA can be performed in a wider spectrum of endometrial cavity configurations than NREA and, at least in expert hands, remains the gold standard. Each of the five available types of NREA device possesses advantages and disadvantages over the others with respect to variables such as treatment time, required cervical dilation, and size and configuration of the endometrial cavity. All provide acceptable results that are comparable to that of REA in expert hands. Serious complications seem to be less common with NREA, but uterine perforation and bowel or other visceral injury can still occur. When endometrial-ablation patients were followed for up to 5 years, repeat surgery rates ranged from 20 to 40%, thereby eroding both the direct and indirect treatment-related resource utilization. Levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine devices demonstrate similar clinical and patient-satisfaction outcomes to endometrial ablation but can be inserted in the office and allow maintenance of fertility. Both REA and NREA provide at least short- to intermediate-term options to hysterectomy for patients with heavy menstrual bleeding and normal or near-normal endometrial cavities. Consequently, the ideal candidates are likely those who are within 5 years of menopause.","A review article of currently available evidence on endometrial ablation for heavy menstrual bleeding concluded that both resectoscopic endometrial ablation (via hysteroscopy) and nonresectoscopic endometrial ablative technologies (radio-frequency electrosurgical ablation, balloon thermal ablation, free fluid ablation, cryotherapy, microwaves) significantly reduce menstrual blood flow. These minimally invasive techniques were an option for women who were not concerned about preserving fertility. However, 20% to 40% of patients who were followed for more than 5 years required repeat treatment or hysterectomy."
"What is the role of prokinetic agents for constipation
The effects of prokinetic treatment with cisapride in patients with constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) were evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Sixty-nine IBS patients were assigned to a 12-week treatment with either 5 mg cisapride or placebo t.i.d.; this dosage could be changed if necessary. The mean weekly number of days on which a stool was passed in the cisapride and placebo group increased to 5.3 and 4.4 (p less than 0.05) during weeks 8-12 of treatment, and the number of days with stools of normal consistency increased to 3.5 and 1.9 (p less than 0.05), respectively. At week 12, the reduction in severity and frequency scores for abdominal pain was significantly greater (p less than or equal to 0.05) in the cisapride group (60 and 61%) than in the placebo group (40 and 32%), as it was for abdominal distension (p less than 0.05). Cisapride tended to be better than placebo in diminishing flatulence. In 71% versus 39% of the patients the overall rating for the response to treatment was good or excellent at week 12. Cisapride was well tolerated. These results suggest that the drug will be useful for the management of constipation-predominant IBS.",One randomized controlled trials of cisapride for constipation showed that it improved symptoms.
"Do calcium supplements prevent postmenopausal osteoporotic fractures
Background. The effectiveness of calcium in retarding bone loss in older postmenopausal women is unclear. Earlier work suggested that the women who were most likely to benefit from calcium supplementation were those with low calcium intakes. Methods. We undertook a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial to determine the effect of calcium on bone loss from the spine, femoral neck, and radius in 301 healthy postmenopausal women, half of whom had a calcium intake lower than 400 mg per day and half an intake of 400 to 650 mg per day. The women received placebo or either calcium carbonate or calcium citrate malate (500 mg of calcium per day) for two years. Results. In women who had undergone menopause five or fewer years earlier, bone loss from the spine was rapid and was not affected by supplementation with calcium. Among the women who had been postmenopausal for six years or more and who were given placebo, bone loss was less rapid in the group with the higher dietary calcium intake. In those with the lower calcium intake, calcium citrate malate prevented bone loss during the two years of the study; its effect was significantly different from that of placebo (P less than 0.05) at the femoral neck (mean change in bone density [+/- SE], 0.87 +/- 1.01 percent vs. -2.11 +/- 0.93 percent), radius (1.05 +/- 0.75 percent vs. -2.33 +/- 0.72 percent), and spine (-0.38 +/- 0.82 percent vs. -2.85 +/- 0.77 percent). Calcium carbonate maintained bone density at the femoral neck (mean change in bone density, 0.08 +/- 0.98 percent) and radius (0.24 +/- 0.70 percent) but not the spine (-2.54 +/- 0.85 percent). Among the women who had been postmenopausal for six years or more and who had the higher calcium intake, those in all three treatment groups maintained bone density at the hip and radius and lost bone from the spine. Conclusions. Healthy older postmenopausal women with a daily calcium intake of less than 400 mg can significantly reduce bone loss by increasing their calcium intake to 800 mg per day. At the dose we tested, supplementation with calcium citrate malate was more effective than supplementation with calcium carbonate.","One double-blind, randomized controlled trial included healthy women who were 6 or more years postmenopausal and had a dietary intake of less than 400 mg of calcium per day. Women who received daily calcium citrate (500 mg) for 2 years had significantly less bone loss at the spine, hip, and radius than women taking placebo. In addition, calcium carbonate supplementation maintained bone density at the hip and radius but not the spine when compared with placebo. This dose of calcium was not associated with better outcomes in women within the first 5 years after menopause, but the dose was less than most generally recommended ranges."
"What blood tests help diagnose celiac disease
In selective IgA deficiency (IgAD), there is no reliable screening test for coeliac disease (CD). To evaluate the usefulness of IgG(1) antiendomysium and IgG antitissue transglutaminase tests for CD diagnosis in IgAD. IgA and IgG antigliadin antibodies (IgA- and IgG-AGA), IgA and IgG(1) antiendomysium antibodies (IgA- and IgG(1)-EMA), and IgA and IgG antitissue transglutaminase (IgA- and IgG-anti-tTG) were assayed in: (a) 20 untreated IgAD/CD patients; (b) 34 IgAD/CD patients on a strict gluten free diet (GFD); (c) 10 IgAD/CD patients not on a strict GFD; (d) 11 untreated CD patients without IgAD; (e) 10 healthy IgAD patients; and (f) 25 healthy controls. In all untreated IgAD/CD patients, IgG(1)-EMA, IgG-anti-tTG, and IgG-AGA were positive whereas IgA antibodies against these antigens were negative. IgAD/CD patients on a strict GFD did not produce IgG-AGA or IgG(1)-EMA but four of 34 produced IgG anti-tTG. IgAD/CD subjects not on a strict GFD produced IgG-AGA whereas 5/10 and 4/10 were IgG(1)- EMA and IgG-anti-tTG negative, respectively. Untreated CD patients without IgAD were AGA (IgA and IgG), EMA (IgA and IgG(1)), and anti-tTG (IgA and IgG) positive. Healthy controls were AGA and EMA negative whereas two of 10 apparently healthy IgAD subjects and one of 25 healthy negative control were IgG-anti-tTG positive. Both IgG(1)-EMA and IgG-anti-tTG tests appear to be useful for identification of IgAD/CD patients whereas they are less satisfactory for monitoring dietary compliance in these subjects. In addition, our findings seem to suggest that IgG-EMA autoantibodies produced by coeliac patients are mainly of the IgG(1) subtype.","In a cross-sectional study, 100% of 20 untreated celiac disease patients with IgA deficiency had positive IgG tests for tTG, AGA, and EMA despite negative IgA tests for the same antibodies. Eleven patients with celiac disease and no IgA deficiency all had positive tTG, AGA, and EMA tests, whether testing for the IgA or IgG forms."
"Sleep apnea in adults: How accurate is clinical prediction
To prospectively study the utility of four clinical prediction models for either predicting the presence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA, apnea-hypopnea index [AHI] > or = 10/hour), or prioritizing patients for a split-night protocol (AHI(3)20/hour). All patients presenting for OSA evaluation completed a research questionnaire that included questions from previously developed clinical prediction models. The probability of sleep apnea for each patient for each model was calculated based upon the equation used in the model. Based upon two cutoffs of apnea-hypopnea index, 10 and 20, the sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value were calculated. For the cutoffs AHI > or =10 and > or =20, receiver operating characteristic curves were generated and the areas under the curves calculated. Comparisons of demographic information and symptom response were compared between patients with and without OSA, and men vs. women. Urban, accredited sleep disorders center. All patients referred for evaluation of OSA who underwent polysomnography. N/A. 370 patients (191 men, 179 women) completed the study. 248 of the 370 (67%) patients had an AHI(3)10; 180 of the 370 (49%) had an AHI> or =20. For AHI > or =10, the sensitivities ranged from 76 to 96%, specificities from 13%-54%, positive predictive values from 69%-77% using the probability cutoff of the original investigators; the areas under the curve from 0.669 to 0.736. For AHI(3)20, the areas under the ROC curves ranged from 0.700 to 0.757; using cutoffs to maximized specificity, the sensitivities ranged from 33%-39%, specificities from 87%-93%, and positive predictive values from 72%-85%. All the models performed better for men. The clinical prediction models tested are not be sufficiently accurate to discriminate between patients with or without OSA but could be useful in prioritizing patients for split-night polysomnography.","A 2000 prospective study of 4 previously developed clinical prediction models for obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome in sleep center populations found sensitivities of 75% to 96% and specificities of 13% to 54% for identifying patients, using a criterion of apnea-hypopnea index >9."
"What is the best test to detect herpes in skin lesions
Virus isolation in cell culture is the recognised diagnostic gold standard for genital herpes. Although increasing evidence indicates that polymerase chain reaction (PCR) provides a more rapid and sensitive diagnostic method, its implementation in routine diagnostic settings has been limited by concerns over contamination and cost. To evaluate the feasibility of replacing virus culture with PCR for the diagnosis of genital herpes in settings serving large populations of genitourinary medicine (GUM) attendees. Genital swabs collected from 233 consecutive GUM attendees with suspected genital herpes were tested in parallel by virus culture and automated real time PCR. Three specimen preparation methods were evaluated and the assay reliability was assessed by repeat testing, comparison with a commercially available assay, and herpes simplex virus (HSV) sequence analysis. Probe melting temperatures (Tm) were used to differentiate between HSV types without additional post-PCR steps. HSV was detected in 79/233 (34%) samples by virus culture and 132/233 (57%) samples by PCR. PCR significantly increased HSV detection in both early (< 5 days) and late (> or = 5 days) presentations and in both first and recurrent episodes. HSV detection and typing by PCR was achieved within less than 4 hours leading to a significant reduction in labour compared to virus culture. Most specimens (120/132, 91%) were typed as HSV-2. Results were highly reproducible. Real time PCR is a highly reproducible, rapid, and labour efficient method for HSV detection in genital swabs. Its implementation is feasible in routine diagnostic settings.","A British study found the rate of virus recovery for early vesicles to be 52% to 93%. This dropped to 41% to 72% if midstage ulcers were present. Finally, the detection for late-stage crusted lesions was only 19% to 27%. Another disadvantage is that culture is labor-intensive. A positive culture takes an average of 3 days to grow, whereas a negative culture must incubate for 10 days. PCR techniques are more sensitive and results can be available in less than 4 hours."
"What are effective medication combinations for dyslipidemia
Ezetimibe is a lipid-lowering drug that inhibits the intestinal absorption of dietary and biliary cholesterol by blocking passage across the intestinal wall. The efficacy and safety of adding ezetimibe to ongoing statin therapy in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia was evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The study group included 769 adults (aged > or =18 years) with primary hypercholesterolemia who had not achieved National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel II goals with dietary alteration and statin monotherapy. Patients receiving a stable dose of a statin for > or =6 weeks were randomized to receive concurrent treatment with placebo (n = 390) or ezetimibe (n = 379), 10 mg/day, in addition to continuing their open-label statin for 8 weeks. The primary efficacy variable was the percent change in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol from baseline with statin monotherapy to end point after intervention (secondary variables: high-density lipoprotein [HDL] cholesterol and triglycerides). Ongoing statin therapy plus ezetimibe led to changes of -25.1% for LDL cholesterol (HDL cholesterol +2.7%; triglycerides -14.0%) compared with LDL cholesterol -3.7% (p <0.001), HDL cholesterol +1.0% (p <0.05), and triglycerides -2.9% (p <0.001) for placebo added to ongoing statin therapy. Among patients not at LDL cholesterol goal at on-statin baseline, 71.5% receiving statin plus ezetimibe versus 18.9% receiving statin plus placebo reached goal at end point (odds ratio 23.7; p <0.001). The co-administration of statin and ezetimibe was generally well tolerated. Adding ezetimibe to ongoing statin therapy led to substantial additional reduction in LDL cholesterol levels, facilitating attainment of NCEP goals. Ezetimibe offers a new therapeutic option for patients receiving statins who require further reduction in LDL cholesterol.","A double-blind trial randomized 769 patients on statin monotherapy who were above their NCEP low density lipoprotein goal to either placebo or ezetimibe 10 mg daily. Absolute low density lipoprotein cholesterol reductions were 25.1% with ezetimibe vs 3.7% with placebo, and low density lipoprotein goal attainment was 71.5% with ezetimibe vs 18.9% with placebo (secondary endpoint)."
"What's the best treatment for gestational diabetes
Fetuses of mothers with gestational diabetes mellitus are at increased risk to develop perinatal complications mainly due to macrosomia. However, in view of the marked heterogeneity of this disease, it seems difficult to set guidelines for diagnosis and treatment. This complicates the choice of assigning patients either to diet or to insulin therapy. Also of concern is how much benefit could be expected from insulin therapy in preventing fetal complications in these patients. In a systematic review of the literature assessing the efficacy of insulin in preventing macrosomia in fetuses of mothers with gestational diabetes, we found six randomized controlled trials comparing diet alone to diet plus insulin. The studies included a total of 1281 patients (644 in the diet plus insulin group and 637 in the diet group), with marked differences among trials concerning diagnostic criteria, randomization process and treatment goals. Meta-analysis of the data resulted in a risk difference of -0.098 (95%CI: -0.168 to -0.028), and a number-necessary-to-treat of 11 (95%CI: 6 to 36), which means that it is necessary to treat 11 patients with insulin to prevent one case of macrosomia. This indicates a potential benefit of insulin, but not significantly enough to set treatment guidelines. Because of the heterogeneous evidence available in the literature about this matter, we conclude that larger trials addressing the efficacy of these two therapeutic modalities in preventing macrosomia are warranted.","A meta-analysis combined 6 RCTs comparing diet alone with diet plus insulin in a total of 1281 women. Insulin was moderately superior to diet in preventing fetal macrosomia (NNT=11; 95% confidence interval, 6-36), but not in rates of hypoglycemia, hypocalcemia, hyperbilirubinemia, or congenital malformations."
"How much can exercise raise creatine kinase level-and does it matter
Serum samples from 14 men and 8 women were obtained pre-marathon (48 h) and at 24, 48, 72, and 96 h post-race to quantitate total serum creatine kinase activity (TCK), percentage of creatine kinase MB (CK-MB), and clearance rates (half-lives) of TCK and CK-MB. TCK was measured enzymatically, and the CK-MB isoenzyme was separated by agarose electrophoresis and quantitated by densitometry. The men's and women's post-race mean TCK levels were significantly elevated (P less than 0.05) above pre-race values at 24 h (3322 U . l-1, 946 U . l-1 and 48 h (1787 U . l-1, 508 U . l-1). In addition, CK-MB was significantly elevated both 24 h (5.1%, 3.3%) and 48 h (2.5%, 1.8%) post-race (P less than 0.05). The men's 24-h TCK was 22.3 times the pre-race value, while the women had an 8.6-fold increase in TCK. The mean 24-h post-race CK-MB activities were 166 U . l-1 for the men and 31 U . l-1 for the women. The mean increase in CK-MB activity was 41.5-fold for the men and 7.8-fold for the women. Furthermore, the men had a mean half-life (t1/2) of 30.4 h for TCK and 12.0 h for CK-MB; the women's t1/2's were 29.4 and 16.8 h, respectively. At all time points, the men evidenced significantly (P less than 0.05) higher TCK and CK-MB enzyme activities than did the women.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","One study followed 203 participants to evaluate the magnitude of creatine kinase elevation and the effect on renal function produced by exercise.

"What is the best way to evaluate acute diarrhea
Few data have been published recently on the etiology of outpatient pediatric diarrhea in the US. We determined the etiology of acute, nondysenteric diarrhea among 147 children between 2 and 11 years old presenting to 9 outpatient clinics in various regions of the US between August, 1991, and August, 1993. Enteropathogens were sought by conventional laboratory methods. The various diarrheagenic Escherichia coli were sought. A recognized etiologic agent was detected in the stools of 89 (60.5%) children and 15 (10) patients had multiple agents detected. Rotavirus was found in 43 (29.3%) of the children, with a spring and winter peak in occurrence. Giardia lamblia was identified in 22 (15%) cases with a spring peak. HEp-2 cell-adherent E. coli were found in 15 (10.2%). Other agents found included: enteric adenovirus in 7 (4.8%); Salmonella in 5 (3.4%); enterohemorrhagic E. coli in 5 (3.4%); enteropathogenic E. coli in 2 (1.4%); enterotoxigenic E. coli in 2 (1.4%); Entamoeba histolytica in 1 (0.70%); and Campylobacter jejuni in 1 (0.7%). In addition to the presence of conventional enteropathogens, diarrheagenic E. coli (HEp-2 cell-adherent E. coli, enterohemorrhagic E. coli, enteropathogenic E. coli and enterotoxigenic E. coli) were associated with endemic pediatric diarrhea in the US.","A prospective study of 147 US children with acute, mild diarrhea demonstrated that rectal swabs yielded a positive test for an infectious agent in 60.5% of cases."
"How reliable are self-measured blood pressures taken at home
Several studies have reported overdiagnosis and overtreatment of hypertensive patients, especially in borderline hypertensives. To find a blood pressure measurement procedure that reduces the risk of misclassification to an acceptable level. Comparative, prospective study over seven months of primary care patients with elevated initial blood pressures. Blood pressure measurements made by general practitioners (GPs), practice nurses, and patients were compared with ambulatory blood pressure measurements. Ninety-nine patients completed the study. Mean differences (systolic blood pressure) between different measurement procedures and ambulatory measurement ranged from +10 mmHg (doctor) to -1 mmHg (patient), and (diastolic) from +4 mmHg (doctor) to -2 mmHg (patient). Standard deviations of mean differences ranged from 12 mmHg (doctor/systolic) to 10 mmHg (patient/systolic), and from 8 mmHg (doctor/diastolic) to 7 mmHg (patient/diastolic). Self-measurements by the patient appear to be a reliable alternative to ambulatory blood pressure measurement. In diagnosing and managing mild hypertension, we recommend the use of a valid self-measuring device.","self measured blood pressure correlates better than office blood pressure with surrogate measures of hypertensive control, such as ambulatory blood pressure measurement."
"What is the preferred treatment for a child with mild persistent asthma
Although inhaled glucocorticosteroids are recommended for persistent asthma, their long-term effect on recent onset, mild, persistent asthma has yet to be established. We did a randomised, double-blind clinical trial in 7241 patients in 32 countries to assess the effects of budesonide in patients who had had mild persistent asthma for less than 2 years and who had not had previous regular treatment with glucocorticosteroids. Patients aged 5-66 years received either budesonide or placebo once daily for 3 years in addition to their usual asthma medications. The daily budesonide dose was 400 microg, or 200 microg for children younger than 11 years. The primary outcome was time to first severe asthma-related event, and analysis was by intention to treat. 198 of 3568 patients on placebo and 117 of 3597 on budesonide had at least one severe asthma exacerbation; hazard ratio 0.56 (95% CI 0.45-0.71, p<0.0001). Patients on budesonide had fewer courses of systemic corticosteroids and more symptom-free days than did those on placebo. Compared with placebo, budesonide increased postbronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) from baseline by 1.48% (p<0.0001) after 1 year and by 0.88% (p=0.0005) after 3 years (expressed as percent of the predicted value). The corresponding increase in prebronchodilator FEV1 was 2.24% after 1 year and 1.71% after 3 years (p<0.0001 at both timepoints). The effect of treatment on all outcome variables was independent of the baseline lung function (prebronchodilator or postbronchodilator) or baseline medication. In children younger than 11 years, 3-year growth was reduced in the budesonide group by 1.34 cm. The reduction was greatest in the first year of treatment (0.58 cm) than years 2 and 3 (0.43 cm and 0.33 cm, respectively). Long-term, once-daily treatment with low-dose budesonide decreases the risk of severe exacerbations and improves asthma control in patients with mild persistent asthma of recent onset.","In the inhaled Steroid Treatment As Regular Therapy (START) in early asthma study, budesonide demonstrated a 44% relative reduction in time to first severe asthma related event, compared with placebo (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.45-0.71; NNT=44; P=.0001)."
"What are effective therapies for Clostridium difficile- associated diarrhea
Faecal metronidazole and hydroxymetronidazole concentrations measured by high pressure liquid chromatography are reported during 10 episodes of Clostridium difficile colitis in nine patients. Bactericidal faecal concentrations were present in all patients with acute disease receiving oral or intravenous metronidazole, and all responded to therapy. Metronidazole and hydroxymetronidazole concentrations fell as the diarrhoea improved and neither substance was detectable in the faeces of five patients after recovery. This demonstration of intracolonic therapeutic concentrations of metronidazole supports the clinical experience of oral metronidazole being effective in the treatment of antibiotic associated diarrhoea caused by C difficile and also suggests a potential role for intravenous metronidazole in this disease.","Patients who cannot take medication by mouth should receive intravenous metronidazole, 500 mg 4 times per day. Unlike vancomycin, metronidazole achieves potentially effective concentrations in the intestinal lumen following intravenous administration."
"Does neonatal circumcision decrease morbidity
It is uncertain whether male circumcision reduces the risks of penile human papillomavirus (HPV) infection in the man and of cervical cancer in his female partner. We pooled data on 1913 couples enrolled in one of seven case-control studies of cervical carcinoma in situ and cervical cancer in five countries. Circumcision status was self-reported, and the accuracy of the data was confirmed by physical examination at three study sites. The presence or absence of penile HPV DNA was assessed by a polymerase-chain-reaction assay in 1520 men and yielded a valid result in the case of 1139 men (74.9 percent). Penile HPV was detected in 166 of the 847 uncircumcised men (19.6 percent) and in 16 of the 292 circumcised men (5.5 percent). After adjustment for age at first intercourse, lifetime number of sexual partners, and other potential confounders, circumcised men were less likely than uncircumcised men to have HPV infection (odds ratio, 0.37; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.16 to 0.85). Monogamous women whose male partners had six or more sexual partners and were circumcised had a lower risk of cervical cancer than women whose partners were uncircumcised (adjusted odds ratio, 0.42; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.23 to 0.79). Results were similar in the subgroup of men in whom circumcision was confirmed by medical examination. Male circumcision is associated with a reduced risk of penile HPV infection and, in the case of men with a history of multiple sexual partners, a reduced risk of cervical cancer in their current female partners.","A recent prospective study from India showed a strong protective effect of circumcision against HIV infection (RR=0.15; 95% CI, 0.04-0.62). This study found no protective effect of circumcision against herpes, syphilis, or gonorrhea, suggesting a biological rather than a behavioral explanation for the protective effect of circumcision against HIV."
"How effective are nasal steroids combined with nonsedating antihistamines for seasonal allergic rhinitis
Intranasal corticosteroids and oral antihistamines are both effective in the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis, although the therapeutic value of administering the two types of agents concurrently has rarely been evaluated. This study was designed to compared the efficacy, safety, and impact on quality of life of fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray (FP ANS), loratadine, FP ANS plus loratadine, and placebo (an aqueous nasal spray plus tablet) in the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis during the mountain cedar allergy season in south central Texas. Six hundred patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis were treated for 2 weeks with either FP ANS 200 microgram once daily, loratadine 10 mg once daily, the FP ANS and loratadine regimens combined, or placebo in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group study. Clinician- and patient-rated total and individual nasal symptom scores after 7 and 14 days of therapy and overall evaluations were significantly lower (P < .001) in the FP ANS and FP ANS plus loratadine groups compared with the loratadine only and placebo groups. Loratadine was not statistically different from placebo in clinician and patient symptom score ratings nor in overall clinician and patient evaluations. FP ANS plus loratadine and FP ANS monotherapy were comparable in efficacy in almost all evaluations; for some patient-rated symptoms the combination was found superior. Mean score changes in the Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire from baseline to day 14 showed significantly greater improvement (P < .001) in quality of life in the FP ANS group than in the group of patients receiving loratadine only or placebo and no significant benefit was demonstrated in the FP ANS plus loratadine group over the FP ANS monotherapy group. No serious or unusual drug-related adverse events were reported. Combining loratadine with FP ANS did not alter the adverse events profile or frequency.","An randomized controlled trials compared fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray with loratadine and with combined therapy. This double-blinded placebo-controlled trial, which included 600 patients, measured patient- and clinician-rated total symptom scores, individual nasal symptom scores, and overall evaluations after 7 and 14 days of therapy. Although the symptom scores for the fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray group were significantly lower than those in the loratadine and placebo groups, no significant difference in scores was found between the fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray and combined groups. The results were the same for the quality-of-life questionnaire scores."
"Can transvaginal ultrasound detect endometrial disease among asymptomatic postmenopausal patients
Our purpose was to evaluate the use of transvaginal ultrasonography for the detection of endometrial disease in a population of postmenopausal women who were without symptoms. Postmenopausal women were screened for potential inclusion in 2 multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of 2 years' duration to evaluate the safety and efficacy of idoxifene in the prevention of osteoporosis. Baseline endometrial evaluation was performed by transvaginal ultrasonography and aspiration biopsy of the endometrium. A total of 1926 women were screened by transvaginal ultrasonography, and 1833 of them had endometrial thickness < or =6 mm. Five cases of endometrial abnormality (adenocarcinoma [n = 1] and atypical hyperplasia [n = 4]) were detected in the 1750 women from this cohort who underwent biopsy. The negative predictive value was >99%. One case of adenocarcinoma was detected in the 42 women who had endometrial thickness >6 mm and underwent biopsy. However, the sampling rate (45%) of women with endometrial thickness >6 mm was too low for confidence in the positive predictive value of 2%. Despite a high negative predictive value, transvaginal ultrasonography may not be an effective screening procedure for detection of endometrial abnormality in untreated postmenopausal women who are without symptoms.","A study evaluated 1926 asymptomatic postmenopausal women with transvaginal ultrasound. Of these, 1833 had endometrial thickness <6 mm and 1750 of this cohort underwent biopsy. Five cases of serious endometrial abnormality were identified in this group (1 adenocarcinoma and 4 atypical hyperplasia). Specificity in this group was 98%, but sensitivity for accurately detecting an abnormality was low at 17%. The negative predictive value was greater than 99%. An inadequate number of patients with endometrial thickness >6 mm were biopsied (45%) to allow for accurate calculation of positive predictive value in those with a >6 mm stripe. The study concludes that transvaginal ultrasonography may not be an effective screening procedure for this population."
"Is combining angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors and ARBs helpful or harmful
The study was designed to assess the antihypertensive effect of combined angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition and angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1) antagonism in patients with essential hypertension. Twenty patients with uncontrolled ambulatory diastolic blood pressure (BP) after 6 weeks of ACE inhibitor monotherapy (benazepril, 20 mg, o.d.) were randomized to receive double-blind valsartan, 80 mg, o.d. (AT1 antagonist) or matching placebo for 5 weeks while continuing to receive background benazepril. Then patients crossed over to the alternative regimen for a second 5-week period. The 24-h ambulatory BP was monitored on the final day of the benazepril monotherapy period and on the final day of each double-blind treatment period. Valsartan added to benazepril produced a significant antihypertensive effect with a benefit over placebo of 6.5 +/- 12.6/4.5 +/- 8.0 mm Hg (systolic/diastolic) for average awake ambulatory BP (p < 0.05), 7.1 +/- 9.4/5.6 +/- 6.5 mm Hg for asleep BP (p < 0.01), and 6.8 +/- 9.7/4.9 +/- 6.8 mm Hg for average 24-h ambulatory BP (p < 0.01). Pulse rate was unaffected. Plasma active renin was higher on the benazepril-valsartan combination compared with benazepril-placebo (p < 0.05). There was no change in routine biochemical variables when valsartan was added to benazepril. Six patients reported mild dizziness or fatigue (three also with placebo). These data suggest that in hypertensive patients uncontrolled with an ACE inhibitor, the addition of an AT1 antagonist provides a powerful and safe antihypertensive drug combination.",A small trial of 20 patients demonstrated improved ambulatory blood pressure control with combination therapy vs angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor monotherapy.
"What treatment approach to intrapartum maternal fever has the best fetal outcomes
Intraamniotic infection is associated with maternal morbidity and neonatal sepsis, pneumonia and death. Although antibiotic treatment is accepted as the standard of care, few studies have been conducted to examine the effectiveness of different antibiotic regimens for this infection and whether to administer antibiotics intrapartum or postpartum. To study the effects of different maternal antibiotic regimens for intraamniotic infection on maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group trials register (May 2002) and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (The Cochrane Library, Issue 2, 2002). Trials where there was a randomized comparison of different antibiotic regimens to treat women with a diagnosis of intraamniotic infection were included. The primary outcome was perinatal morbidity. Data were extracted from each publication independently by the authors. Two eligible trials (181 women) were included in this review. No trials were identified that compared antibiotic treatment with no treatment. Intrapartum treatment with antibiotics for intraamniotic infection was associated with a reduction in neonatal sepsis (relative risk (RR) 0.08; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.00, 1.44) and pneumonia (RR 0.15; CI 0.01, 2.92) compared with treatment given immediately postpartum, but these results did not reach statistical significance (number of women studied = 45). There was no difference in the incidence of maternal bacteremia (RR 2.19; CI 0.25, 19.48). There was no difference in the outcomes of neonatal sepsis (RR 2.16; CI 0.20, 23.21) or neonatal death (RR 0.72; CI 0.12, 4.16) between a regimen with and without anaerobic activity (number of women studied = 133). There was a trend towards a decrease in the incidence of post-partum endometritis in women who received treatment with ampicillin, gentamicin and clindamycin compared with ampicillin and gentamicin alone, but this did not reach statistical significance (RR 0.54; CI 0.19, 1.49). The conclusions that can be drawn from this meta-analysis are limited due to the small number of studies. For none of the outcomes was a statistically significant difference seen between the different interventions. Current consensus is for the intrapartum administration of antibiotics when the diagnosis of intraamniotic infection is made; however, the results of this review neither support nor refute this although there was a trend towards improved neonatal outcomes when antibiotics were administered intrapartum. No recommendations can be made on the most appropriate antimicrobial regimen to choose to treat intraamniotic infection.","Intrapartum treatment with antibiotics was associated with a ""significant"" clinical reduction in neonatal sepsis (relative risk [RR]=0.08; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.00-1.44) and pneumonia (RR=0.15; 95% CI, 0.01-2.92) compared with treatment given immediately postpartum; however, neither value was truly statistically significant according to a Cochrane review."
"What is the preferred treatment for a child with mild persistent asthma
The optimal treatment for mild asthma is uncertain. We assessed the effects of adding a long-acting inhaled beta-agonist, formoterol, to low doses of an inhaled corticosteroid, budesonide, for 1 yr in subjects with mild asthma, receiving no or only a small dose of inhaled corticosteroid. The 698 corticosteroid free patients (Group A) were assigned to twice daily treatment with 100 microg budesonide, 100 microg budesonide plus 4.5 microg formoterol, or placebo. The 1,272 corticosteroid-treated patients (Group B) were assigned to twice daily treatment with 100 microg budesonide, 100 microg budesonide plus 4.5 microg formoterol, 200 microg budesonide, or 200 microg budesonide plus 4.5 microg formoterol. The main outcome variables were time to the first severe asthma exacerbation and poorly controlled asthma days. In Group A, budesonide alone reduced the risk for severe exacerbations by 60% and poorly controlled days by 48%; adding formoterol increased lung function with no change in other end points. By contrast, in Group B, adding formoterol reduced the risk for the first severe exacerbation and for poorly controlled days by 43 and 30%, respectively. Thus, in corticosteroid-free patients, low dose inhaled budesonide alone reduced severe exacerbations and improved asthma control, and in patients already receiving inhaled corticosteroid, adding formoterol was more effective than doubling the corticosteroid dose.","Evidence does not support use of long-acting beta-agonists as monotherapy or in combination with other medications for children with mild persistent asthma. Although 1 study showed an improvement in lung function for children taking budesonide plus formoterol compared with budesonide alone, the rate of severe exacerbations was lower for those taking budesonide alone (62% decrease vs 55.8% decrease; P=.001). Both groups had a 32% decrease in the number of rescue inhalations per day when compared with placebo (P=.0008)."
"What findings distinguish acute bacterial sinusitis
A controlled clinical trial was conducted to compare the effect of four different interventions on hyperbilirubinemia in 125 full-term breast-fed infants. Of 1685 term infants who met the inclusion criteria, 126 (7.4%) had a serum bilirubin concentration > or = 291 mumol/L (17 mg/dL). When the bilirubin reached this level, babies were assigned at random to one of four interventions: (1) continue breast-feeding and observe; (2) discontinue breast-feeding, substitute formula; (3) discontinue breast-feeding, substitute formula and administer phototherapy; (4) continue breast-feeding, administer phototherapy. The serum bilirubin concentration reached 342 mumol/L (20 mg/dL) in 24% of infants in group 1, 19% in group 2, 3% in group 3, and 14% in group 4. When phototherapy was used, the decline in serum bilirubin was significantly larger and more rapid (compared with no phototherapy). In the majority of breast-fed infants whose serum bilirubin levels reach 291 mumol/L (17 mg/dL) the bilirubin will decline spontaneously and will not reach 342 mumol/L (20 mg/dL). If the infant is significantly jaundiced and a decision is made to intervene, parents can be given a number of options and can make an informed decision regarding which, if any, intervention they prefer.","In a randomized, nonblinded clinical trial, 125 jaundiced breastfed newborns (total serum bilirubin level of ≥17mg/dL) were assigned to 4 treatment groups: (1) continue breastfeeding and observe; (2) discontinue breastfeeding, substitute with formula; (3) discontinue breastfeeding, substitute with formula, and administer phototherapy; and (4) continue breastfeeding, administer phototherapy. The study did not find a clinically significant difference in serum bilirubin reduction to normal levels at 48 hours between breastfed and bottle-fed groups undergoing phototherapy (RR=1.07; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.6-1.92; P=.818), or between breastfed and bottle-fed groups who did not have phototherapy (RR not calculated; P=.051). No patient required exchange transfusion, and in no case did total serum bilirubin exceed 23 mg/dL."
"What is the most beneficial diet for patients with diverticulosis
Three treatments for patients with symptomatic diverticular disease were compared in a crossover trial. Neither a high-roughage diet (HRD) nor Normacol plus an antispasmodic were as effective as bran tablets, which produced a significant increase in daily stool weight and a decrease in the intestinal transit time. An abnormal rapid electrical rhythm in colonic smooth muscle was found initially in 80% of the patients, but the incidence was reduced by each treatment after one month; it was present in only 40% of patients after treatment with bran tablets. Only bran significantly reduced a high percentage motility to within normal limits. Bran proved to be the most effective treatment, not only in improving the symptoms in patients with diverticular disease but also in returning to normal the abnormal pathophysiological changes. Bran tablets were both convenient and acceptable as well as effective.","One study found that sterculia gum with an antispasmodic, a high roughage diet, and bran tablets all improved symptomatic diverticular disease, with bran tablets associated with the greatest improvement."
"Does treatment of acne with Retin A and tetracycline cause adverse effects
Because minocycline can cause serious adverse events including hypersensitivity syndrome reaction (HSR), serum sicknesslike reaction (SSLR), and drug-induced lupus, a follow-up study based on a retrospective review of our Drug Safety Clinic and the Health Protection Branch databases and a literature review was conducted to determine if similar rare events are associated with tetracycline and doxycycline. Cases of isolated single organ dysfunction (SOD) attributable to the use of these antibiotics also were identified. Nineteen cases of HSR due to minocycline, 2 due to tetracycline, and 1 due to doxycycline were identified. Eleven cases of SSLR due to minocycline, 3 due to tetracycline, and 2 due to doxycycline were identified. All 33 cases of drug-induced lupus were attributable to minocycline. Forty cases of SOD from minocycline, 37 cases from tetracycline, and 6 from doxycycline were detected. Hypersensitivity syndrome reaction, SSLR, and SOD occur on average within 4 weeks of therapy, whereas minocycline-induced lupus occurs on average 2 years after the initiation of therapy. Early serious events occurring during the course of tetracycline antibiotic treatment include HSR, SSLR, and SOD. Drug-induced lupus, which occurs late in the course of therapy, is reported only with minocycline. We theorize that minocycline metabolism may account for the increased frequency of serious adverse events with this drug.","A study of the safety of tetracycline, which used reports in a drug safety database and a literature review of reported adverse events, concluded that rare but serious events do occur with tetracycline. Severe cutaneous adverse reaction was the most common reported single-organ dysfunction. Other rare events included hypersensitivity syndrome reactions and serum sickness-like reactions."
"How should patients with Barrett's esophagus be monitored
Patients with Barrett's oesophagus have an increased risk of oesophageal adenocarcinoma but this cancer only accounts for a small proportion of deaths in these patients. Other causes of death are reportedly raised in this group. We examined cause specific mortality among individuals in a population based Barrett's oesophagus register. We constructed a register of all patients diagnosed with columnar mucosa (including specialised intestinal metaplasia) of the oesophagus within Northern Ireland between 1993 and 1999. Deaths occurring within this cohort until 31 December 2000 were identified and mortality rates were compared with the general population. Overall mortality was not raised in Barrett's patients. During 7413 person years of follow up in 2373 patients there were 253 deaths (standardised mortality ratio (SMR) 96 (95% confidence interval (CI) 84-107)). Mortality from oesophageal cancer was raised in patients with specialised intestinal metaplasia (SMR 774 (95% CI 317-1231)) but only 4.7% of patients died from this cancer. Mortality from stroke (SMR 65 (95% CI 37-93)) was significantly lower than the general population while mortality from non-cancerous digestive system diseases was significantly higher (SMR 211 (95% CI 111-311)). Mortality rates from all other causes were similar to those of the general population. This study demonstrates that the overall mortality rate in patients with Barrett's oesophagus is closely similar to that of the general population. Oesophageal cancer mortality was raised but is an uncommon cause of death in these patients who also appear to have a reduced risk of death from stroke.","Recommendations for frequent endoscopic surveillance are also weakened by the overall low rate of mortality from esophageal carcinoma noted in Barrett's esophagus patients. A recent population based study demonstrated that there was no difference in overall mortality in those with a Barrett's esophagus diagnosis compared with the general population.6 An increased risk of death from esophageal carcinoma was seen in patients with Barrett's esophagus (4.7% seen in Barrett's esophagus patients compared with 0.8% predicted in the general population; P<.05). The overall increased effect on mortality, however, was relatively small. Esophageal carcinoma accounted for less then 5% of deaths in Barrett's esophagus patients reported during the study's 6-year follow-up period."
"How long is expectant management safe in first-trimester miscarriage
To evaluate the uptake and outcome of expectant management of spontaneous first trimester miscarriage in an early pregnancy assessment unit. 1096 consecutive patients with a diagnosis of spontaneous first trimester miscarriage. Each miscarriage was classified as complete, incomplete, missed, or anembryonic on the basis of ultrasonography. Women who needed treatment were given the choice of expectant management or surgical evacuation of retained products of conception under general anaesthesia. Women undergoing expectant management were checked a few days after transvaginal bleeding had stopped, or they were monitored at weekly intervals for four weeks. A complete miscarriage (absence of transvaginal bleeding and endometrial thickness <15 mm), the number of women completing their miscarriage within each week of management, and complications (excessive pain or transvaginal bleeding necessitating hospital admission or clinical evidence of infection). Two patients with molar pregnancies were excluded, and 37% of the remainder (408/1094) were classified as having had a complete miscarriage. 70% (478/686) of women with retained products of conception chose expectant management; of these, 27 (6%) were lost to follow up. A successful outcome without surgical intervention was seen in 81% of cases (367/451). The rate of spontaneous completion was 91% (201/221) for those cases classified as incomplete miscarriage, 76% (105/138) for missed miscarriage, and 66% (61/92) for anembryonic pregnancy. 70% of women completed their miscarriage within 14 days of classification (84% for incomplete miscarriage and 52% for missed miscarriage and anembryonic pregnancy). Most women with retained products of conception chose expectant management. Ultrasonography can be used to advise patients on the likelihood that their miscarriage will complete spontaneously within a given time.","An observational study evaluated 1096 consecutive patients with suspected first-trimester abortion, classified by ultrasound as complete, incomplete, missed, or anembryonic. In the latter 3 categories, patients chose expectant management (478) or immediate surgical evacuation (208). Those choosing expectant management were monitored weekly and offered surgical evacuation if their abortion was incomplete after 1 month. Complications arose in 6 of 451 patients (1%) managed expectantly for up to 46 days, and in 5 of 208 patients (2%) managed surgically (not statistically significant). One patient in the expectant group had emergency surgery and blood transfusion."
"What is the risk of adverse outcomes in a woman who develops mild hypertension from OCs
A controlled prospective survey of women taking oestrogen-progestogen oral contraceptives showed increases in mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure of 14.2 mm Hg and 8.5 mm Hg respectively after four years. The largest increases in individual cases were 36 mm Hg systolic and 20 mm Hg diastolic. Blood pressure returned to pretreatment levels within three months after oral contraceptives had been stopped. These changes in blood pressure were unrelated to the progestogenic potencies of the preparations being taken.",A prospective study which followed 32 women who had taken combined OCs for 1 to 3 years and then stopped found that blood pressures returned to pretreatment levels at 3 months. Systolic pressure fell by 9.7 mm Hg and diastolic by 2.9 mm Hg compared with measurements made 1 month before stopping. No cardiovascular complications were reported among women during this study.
"What's the best test for HSV-2 after exposure
Most persons who have serologic evidence of infection with herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 2 (HSV-2) are asymptomatic. Historically, it has been assumed that these persons have less frequent viral reactivation than those with symptomatic infection. We conducted a prospective study to investigate genital shedding of HSV among 53 subjects who had antibodies to HSV-2 but who reported having no history of genital herpes, and we compared their patterns of viral shedding with those in a similar cohort of 90 subjects with symptomatic HSV-2 infection. Genital secretions of the subjects in both groups were sampled daily and cultured for HSV for a median of 94 days. HSV was isolated from the genital mucosa in 38 of the 53 HSV-2-seropositive subjects (72 percent) who reported no history of genital herpes, and HSV DNA was detected by the polymerase-chain-reaction assay in cultures prepared from genital mucosal swabs in 6 additional subjects. The rate of subclinical shedding of HSV in the subjects with no reported history of genital herpes was similar to that in the subjects with such a history (3.0 percent vs. 2.7 percent). Of the 53 subjects who had no reported history of genital herpes, 33 (62 percent) subsequently reported having typical herpetic lesions; the duration of their recurrences in these subjects was shorter (median, three days vs. five days; P<0.001) and the frequency lower (median, 3.0 per year vs. 8.2 per year; P<0.001) than in the 90 subjects with previously diagnosed symptomatic infection. Only 1 of these 53 subjects had no clinical or virologic evidence of HSV infection. Seropositivity for HSV-2 is associated with viral shedding in the genital tract, even in subjects with no reported history of genital herpes.",A prospective cohort study compared the viral shedding by Western blot among 52 asymptomatic seropositive patients with 90 seropositive and symptomatic patients. Daily genital swabs were done for 3 months for each patient. The asymptomatic individuals had HSV-2 positive cultures on 3% of culture days. Genital culture appears to have a very poor sensitivity (5%) for diagnosis of HSV-2 infection among asymptomatic individuals.
"What is the best test to detect herpes in skin lesions
These guidelines for the treatment of patients who have sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) were developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) after consultation with a group of professionals knowledgeable in the field of STDs who met in Atlanta on September 26-28, 2000. The information in this report updates the 1998 Guidelines for Treatment of Sexually Transmitted Diseases (MMWR 1998;47 [No. RR-1]). Included in these updated guidelines are new alternative regimens for scabies, bacterial vaginosis, early syphilis, and granuloma inguinale; an expanded section on the diagnosis of genital herpes (including type-specific serologic tests); new recommendations for treatment of recurrent genital herpes among persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); a revised approach to the management of victims of sexual assault; expanded regimens for the treatment of urethral meatal warts; and inclusion of hepatitis C as a sexually transmitted infection. In addition, these guidelines emphasize education and counseling for persons infected with human papillomavirus, clarify the diagnostic evaluation of congenital syphilis, and present information regarding the emergence of quinolone-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae and implications for treatment. Recommendations also are provided for vaccine-preventable STDs, including hepatitis A and hepatitis B.","Serologic tests are often used to detect herpes simplex virus because they can differentiate between HSV-1 and HSV-2. There is an FDA-approved point-of-care test called POCkit that gives results from capillary blood or serum during an office visit. These tests are 80% to 98% sensitive and more than 96% specific. Unfortunately, they are not readily available in all countries."
"Does acyclovir help herpes simplex virus cold sores if treatment is delayed
In a double-blind, randomized, patient-initiated clinical trial, 174 nonimmunocompromised patients with a history of virus-culture-confirmed herpes simplex labialis were treated with acyclovir capsules, 400 mg five times daily for 5 days, or placebo capsules. For 97% of the patients, treatment started within 1 h of the first sign or symptom of a recurrence. The frequency of positive lesion virus cultures was significantly lower among acyclovir-treated subjects (29/114, 25%) than among placebo-treated subjects (29/60, 48%; P = .004). Drug treatment did not affect the development of lesions, measured by the frequency of macular and papular (aborted) lesions and mean maximum lesion size. However, acyclovir hastened lesion resolution among the patients who could start treatment in the prodrome or erythema lesion stage. For this group, the mean duration of pain was reduced by 36% (P = .02) and the mean healing time to loss of crust by 27% (P = .03). Thus, oral acyclovir alleviated some of the clinical manifestations of herpes simplex labialis.","Overall, acyclovir did not effect lesion progression, size, or healing time to loss of hard crust or normal skin. However, the mean duration of pain for all patients significantly decreased (2.5 days vs 3.8 days for placebo, P=.01). For the subgroup of patients who started acyclovir treatment in the prodrome or erythema stage, the mean duration of pain significantly decreased (2.5 days vs 3.9 days for placebo, P=.02), as did healing time to loss of crust (5.8 days vs 7.9 days for placebo, P=.03). Among those who started acyclovir in the papular stage, the trend was toward drug benefit, but this was not statistically significant (mean pain duration: 2.5 vs. 3.6, P=.36; mean healing time to loss of crust: 8.0 vs. 7.2, P=.52). This evidence supports early (prodrome or erythema stage) but not late (macule, papule, vesicle, or crusted stage) treatment of herpes simplex virus 1 with oral acyclovir."
"Which tests are the most useful for diagnosing pelvic inflammatory disease
In 50 patients with a provisional diagnosis of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), CA 125 concentrations in serum were measured before laparoscopy and during hospitalization, using an enzyme immunoassay. The findings at laparoscopy were graded on the basis of the extent of inflammatory peritoneal involvement (grades 0-3; normal observations having a score of 0). On admission, 66% of the patients had serum CA 125 concentrations in excess of the cut-off value of 16 U/ml (range: 20-1300 U/ml). The serum CA 125 concentration before laparoscopy correlated with the extent of inflammatory peritoneal involvement (eta = 0.74). The predictive value of an elevated serum CA 125 level to indicate the presence of salpingitis (grades 1-3) was 97%. However, the predictive value of a normal CA 125 level indicating normal observations at laparoscopy (grade 0) was only 47%. During treatment and follow-up, the serum CA 125 concentration returned gradually to normal levels. It was concluded that the finding of an elevated serum CA 125 level confirms the diagnosis of peritoneal involvement in patients with a clinical diagnosis of PID.",A study of serum CA-125 levels showed a predictive value of 97% for values >16 U/mL in diagnosing salpingitis. This test might therefore be useful in confirming peritoneal involvement when pelvic inflammatory disease is suspected clinically.
"Is DEET safe for children
The worldwide threat of arthropod-transmitted diseases, with their associated morbidity and mortality, underscores the need for effective insect repellents. Multiple chemical, botanical, and ""alternative"" repellent products are marketed to consumers. We sought to determine which products available in the United States provide reliable and prolonged complete protection from mosquito bites. We conducted studies involving 15 volunteers to test the relative efficacy of seven botanical insect repellents; four products containing N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide, now called N,N-diethyl-3-methylbenzamide (DEET); a repellent containing IR3535 (ethyl butylacetylaminopropionate); three repellent-impregnated wristbands; and a moisturizer that is commonly claimed to have repellent effects. These products were tested in a controlled laboratory environment in which the species of the mosquitoes, their age, their degree of hunger, the humidity, the temperature, and the light-dark cycle were all kept constant. DEET-based products provided complete protection for the longest duration. Higher concentrations of DEET provided longer-lasting protection. A formulation containing 23.8 percent DEET had a mean complete-protection time of 301.5 minutes. A soybean-oil-based repellent protected against mosquito bites for an average of 94.6 minutes. The IR3535-based repellent protected for an average of 22.9 minutes. All other botanical repellents we tested provided protection for a mean duration of less than 20 minutes. Repellent-impregnated wristbands offered no protection. Currently available non-DEET repellents do not provide protection for durations similar to those of DEET-based repellents and cannot be relied on to provide prolonged protection in environments where mosquito-borne diseases are a substantial threat.",Increasing the concentration of DEET does not improve protection but does provide longer duration. Concentrations of 6.65% protect for about 2 hours while 23.8% DEET can last about 5 hours.
"How does tissue adhesive compare with suturing for superficial lacerations
Most lacerations and surgical incisions are closed with sutures or staples. Octylcyanoacrylate tissue adhesive (OCA) was recently approved for use in the United States. We compared the cosmetic appearance of lacerations and incisions repaired with OCA versus standard wound closure methods (SWC). A multicenter randomized clinical trial including patients with simple lacerations or surgical incisions was conducted at 10 clinical sites. Patients were randomly assigned to treatment with OCA or SWC. Follow-up was performed at 1 week and at 3 months to determine infection rates and cosmetic outcome. Eight hundred fourteen patients with 924 wounds (383 traumatic lacerations, 235 excisions of skin lesions or scar revisions, 208 minimally invasive surgeries, and 98 general surgical procedures) were enrolled. Groups were similar in baseline characteristics. Wound closure with OCA was faster than with SWC (2.9 vs 5.2 minutes, P <.001). At 1 week infection rates were similar (OCA, 2.1% vs SWC, 0.7%; P =.09) and fewer OCA wounds were erythematous (18% vs 36%, P <.001). There were no differences in wound dehiscence rates (OCA, 1.6% vs SWC, 0.9%; P =.35). At 3 months there was no difference in the percent of wounds with optimal appearance (OCA, 82% vs SWC, 83%; P =.67). Repair of traumatic lacerations and surgical incisions with OCA is faster than with SWC, and cosmetic outcome is similar at 3 months.","A multicenter, randomized trial studied 924 wounds (383 traumatic, 541 surgical) and reported no difference in cosmetic appearance upon grading by both a clinician and the patients themselves."
"What is the risk of adverse outcomes in a woman who develops mild hypertension from OCs
Oral contraceptives induce hypertension in approximately 5% of users of high-dose pills that contain at least 50 micrograms estrogen and 1 to 4 mg progestin, and small increases in blood pressure have been reported even among users of modern low-dose formulations. However, neither the responsible hormone in the oral contraceptive nor particular subgroups of women who might be susceptible to the hypertensive effect of oral contraceptives have been identified. In a prospective cohort study in the United States, 68 297 female nurses aged 25 to 42 years and free of diagnosed hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease, stroke, and cancer at baseline were followed up for 4 years. During 231 006 person-years of follow-up, 1567 incident cases of hypertension were diagnosed. Compared with women who had never used oral contraceptives, the age-adjusted relative risk was 1.5 (95% CI = 1.2 to 1.8) for current use and 1.1 (95% CI = 0.9 to 1.2) for past use. After adjustment for age, body mass index, hormones cigarette smoking, family history of hypertension, parity, physical activity, alcohol intake, and ethnicity, current users of oral contraceptives had an increased risk of development of hypertension (RR = 1.8; 95% CI = 1.5 to 2.3) compared with women who had never used them. The multivariate relative risk for past users was 1.2 (95% CI = 1.0 to 1.4). There were no important modifying effects of age, family history of hypertension, ethnicity, or body mass index. Current users of oral contraceptives had a significant, moderately increased risk of hypertension. However, among this group, only 41.5 cases per 10 000 person-years could be attributed to oral contraceptive use. Risk decreased quickly with cessation of oral contraceptives, and past users appeared to have only a slightly increased risk.","A prospective cohort study found an increased incidence of new hypertension developing among women taking OCs. The study, conducted in the US, included 68,297 female nurses aged 25 to 42 years without a previous diagnosis of hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease, stroke, or cancer, who were followed for 4 years. Women were excluded from the study if they had not had a physical exam in the last 2 years or were taking antihypertensive medication at study inception. The nurses self-reported their blood pressure readings via questionnaire; medical records were sampled to validate the accuracy of self-reports. After adjusting for risk factors, current oral contraceptive use increased the risk of developing hypertension (relative risk [RR]=1.8; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.5-2.3; corresponding to 41.5 new cases of hypertension per 10,000 person-years)."
"What are the indications for evaluating a patient with cough for pertussis
No diagnostic test for pertussis in routine use in the United States has both high sensitivity and high specificity. During a statewide increase in the incidence of pertussis in Missouri, we studied the clinical features of 153 patients with suspected pertussis in the Greater St. Louis area from whom a specimen for pertussis culture had been taken between 15 May and 19 September 1989. In this cross-sectional study, nasopharyngeal cultures were more likely to be positive for persons whose specimens were collected < 21 days after cough onset (adjusted rate ratio [RRa] and 95% confidence interval = 3.4; 1.5-8.0) and who were not receiving erythromycin/sulfamethoxazole prior to the culture [RRa = 5.8; 0.8-40.6], who had received fewer than three prior doses of pertussis vaccine [RRa = 1.8; 0.8-4.2], and whose specimen was in transit to the laboratory for < 4 days [RRa = 2.0; 0.8-5.5]. Among children < 5 years of age, spasmodic cough plus a lymphocytosis of > 10,000/mm3 was the acute symptom complex associated with the highest predictive value for a positive culture result (67%). Cough for > or = 14 days plus whoop was sensitive (81%) and specific (58%) for identifying children with culture-confirmed pertussis. Direct fluorescent antibody staining performed well as a screening test for pertussis but requires substantial commitment of personnel and resources. In the absence of a positive culture result, clinical case definitions should be used for decision making (e.g., initiation of antimicrobial therapy and routine case reporting).","A cohort series of children aged <5 years with suspected pertussis compared 33 with positive cultures to 55 with negative cultures. The constellation of spasmodic cough and lymphocytosis (>10,000) had a sensitivity of 83%, a LR+ of 2.5, and a LR- of 0.25. Cough >14 days with whoop and vomiting had a sensitivity of 67%, a LR+ of 3.2, and LR- of 0.42."
"What is the appropriate diagnostic evaluation of fibroids
To determine the accuracy of transvaginal ultrasonography, sonohysterography and diagnostic hysteroscopy for the investigation of abnormal uterine bleeding in premenopausal women. Systematic review of common diagnostic imaging tests. Relevant papers were identified through electronic searching of MEDLINE (1980 to July 2001) and EMBASE (1980 to July 2001) and manual searching of a bibliography of primary and review articles. Studies were selected if accuracy of transvaginal ultrasonography, sonohysterography and diagnostic hysteroscopy was compared with a reference standard and included data that could be abstracted into a two-by-two table in order to calculate sensitivity and specificity. Quality assessment and data extraction were performed by at least two independent reviewers. Diagnostic accuracy was determined by calculating positive and negative likelihood ratios for all intrauterine pathologies, submucous fibroids and endometrial hyperplasia. Nineteen studies met the inclusion criteria. Statistically significant heterogeneity was present between the likelihood ratios for studies of transvaginal ultrasound. A positive test result with sonohysterography diagnosed submucous fibroids with a pooled likelihood ratio of 29.7 (17.8, 49.6). A positive test result with hysteroscopy diagnosed submucous fibroids with a pooled likelihood ratio of 29.4 (13.4, 65.3), and any intrauterine pathology with a pooled likelihood ratio of 7.7 (4.3, 13.7). A negative test result with hysteroscopy for diagnosing any intrauterine pathology had a pooled likelihood ratio of 0.07 (0.04, 0.15). Although there was considerable variability present between the studies, all three diagnostic tests were moderately accurate in detecting intrauterine pathology. However, sonohysterography and hysteroscopy performed better than transvaginal ultrasound in detecting submucous fibroids.","In a systematic review of 7 studies, sonohysterography demonstrated a clinically significant LR+ of 29.7. There was too much heterogeneity in the data to calculate an LR-."
"What are the indications for bariatric surgery
About 5% of the US population is morbidly obese. This disease remains largely refractory to diet and drug therapy, but generally responds well to bariatric surgery. To determine the impact of bariatric surgery on weight loss, operative mortality outcome, and 4 obesity comorbidities (diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and obstructive sleep apnea). Electronic literature search of MEDLINE, Current Contents, and the Cochrane Library databases plus manual reference checks of all articles on bariatric surgery published in the English language between 1990 and 2003. Two levels of screening were used on 2738 citations. A total of 136 fully extracted studies, which included 91 overlapping patient populations (kin studies), were included for a total of 22,094 patients. Nineteen percent of the patients were men and 72.6% were women, with a mean age of 39 years (range, 16-64 years). Sex was not reported for 1537 patients (8%). The baseline mean body mass index for 16 944 patients was 46.9 (range, 32.3-68.8). A random effects model was used in the meta-analysis. The mean (95% confidence interval) percentage of excess weight loss was 61.2% (58.1%-64.4%) for all patients; 47.5% (40.7%-54.2%) for patients who underwent gastric banding; 61.6% (56.7%-66.5%), gastric bypass; 68.2% (61.5%-74.8%), gastroplasty; and 70.1% (66.3%-73.9%), biliopancreatic diversion or duodenal switch. Operative mortality (< or =30 days) in the extracted studies was 0.1% for the purely restrictive procedures, 0.5% for gastric bypass, and 1.1% for biliopancreatic diversion or duodenal switch. Diabetes was completely resolved in 76.8% of patients and resolved or improved in 86.0%. Hyperlipidemia improved in 70% or more of patients. Hypertension was resolved in 61.7% of patients and resolved or improved in 78.5%. Obstructive sleep apnea was resolved in 85.7% of patients and was resolved or improved in 83.6% of patients. Effective weight loss was achieved in morbidly obese patients after undergoing bariatric surgery. A substantial majority of patients with diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and obstructive sleep apnea experienced complete resolution or improvement.","A meta-analysis proved bariatric surgery not only efficacious for weight loss, but showed that a substantial majority of patients with diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and obstructive sleep apnea experienced complete resolution or significant improvement of their comorbid condition after surgery."
"Does psychiatric treatment help patients with intractable chronic pain
Chronic low back pain is, in many countries, the main cause of long term disability in middle age. Patients with chronic low back pain are often referred for multidisciplinary treatment. Previous published systematic reviews on this topic included no randomised controlled trials and pooled together controlled and non-controlled studies. To assess the effect of multidisciplinary bio-psycho-social rehabilitation on pain, function, employment, quality of life and global assessment outcomes in subjects with chronic disabling low back pain. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychLIT, CINAHL, Health STAR, and The Cochrane Library from the beginning of the database to June 1998 using the comprehensive search strategy recommended by the Back Review Group of the Cochrane Collaboration. Intervention specific key words for this review were: patient care team, patient care management, multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary, multiprofessional, multimodal, pain clinic and functional restoration. We also reviewed reference lists and consulted the editors of the Back Review Group of the Cochrane Collaboration. Design: randomised controlled trials comparing multidisciplinary bio-psycho-social rehabilitation with a non-multidisciplinary control intervention. Population: Adults with disabling low back pain of more than three months in duration. Intervention: Patients had to be assessed and treated by qualified professionals according to a plan that addresses physical and at least one of psychological, or social/occupational dimensions. Outcomes: Only trials which reported treatment effect in at least one of pain, function, employment status, quality of life or global improvement. Exclusion: Pure educational interventions (back schools) and pure physical interventions were excluded. Selection, data extraction and quality grading of studies was done by two independent reviewers using pre-tested data forms. Study quality was assessed according to the scheme recommended by the Back Review Group of the Cochrane Collaboration. Trials with internal validity scores of five or more in a ten point scale were considered high quality. Discrepancies between reviewers were resolved by consensus or by a third reviewer. Given the marked heterogeneity in study settings, interventions and control groups we decided not to pool trial results in a meta-analysis. Instead, we summarized findings by strength of evidence and nature of intervention and control treatments. The evidence was judged to be strong when multiple high quality trials produced generally consistent findings. It was judged to be moderate when multiple low quality or one high quality and one or more low quality trials produced generally consistent findings. Evidence was considered to be limited when only one randomised trial existed or if findings of existing trials were inconsistent. Ten trials (12 randomised comparisons) were included. They randomised a total of 1964 patients with chronic low back pain. There was strong evidence that intensive multidisciplinary bio-psycho-social rehabilitation with a functional restoration approach improved function when compared with inpatient or outpatient non-multidisciplinary treatments. There was moderate evidence that intensive multidisciplinary bio-psycho-social rehabilitation with a functional restoration approach improved pain when compared with outpatient non-multidisciplinary rehabilitation or usual care. There was contradictory evidence regarding vocational outcomes of intensive multidisciplinary bio-psycho-social intervention. Some trials reported improvements in work readiness, but others showed no significant reduction in sickness leaves. Less intensive outpatient psycho-physical treatments did not improve pain, function or vocational outcomes when compared with non-multidisciplinary outpatient therapy or usual care. Few trials reported effects on quality of life or global assessments. The reviewed trials provide evidence that intensive multidisciplinary bio-psycho-social rehabilitation with a functional restoration approach improves pain and function. Less intensive interventions did not show improvements in clinically relevant outcomes.","For chronic back pain, a Cochrane review including 1964 patients found strong evidence for pain reduction and modest evidence for functional improvement from intensive (>100 hours) multidisciplinary biopsychosocial rehabilitation. Less intense and less comprehensive psychophysical programs did not reduce pain or improve function. It was unclear if the intensive programs were generalizable"
"What drugs are best for bipolar depression
There is a major unmet need for effective options in the treatment of bipolar depression. Five hundred forty-two outpatients with bipolar I (N=360) or II (N=182) disorder experiencing a major depressive episode (DSM-IV) were randomly assigned to 8 weeks of quetiapine (600 or 300 mg/day) or placebo. The primary efficacy measure was mean change from baseline to week 8 in the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale total score. Additional efficacy assessments included the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, Clinical Global Impression of severity and improvement, Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire. Quetiapine at either dose demonstrated statistically significant improvement in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale total scores compared with placebo from week 1 onward. The proportions of patients meeting response criteria (> or =50% Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale score improvement) at the final assessment in the groups taking 600 and 300 mg/day of quetiapine were 58.2% and 57.6%, respectively, versus 36.1% for placebo. The proportions of patients meeting remission criteria (Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale < or =12) were 52.9% in the groups taking 600 and 300 mg/day of quetiapine versus 28.4% for placebo. Quetiapine at 600 and 300 mg/day significantly improved 9 of 10 and 8 of 10 Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale items, respectively, compared to placebo, including the core symptoms of depression. Treatment-emergent mania rates were low and similar for the quetiapine and placebo groups (3.2% and 3.9%, respectively). Quetiapine monotherapy is efficacious and well tolerated for the treatment of bipolar depression.","Two 8-week, double-blind RCTs assessed the efficacy of quetiapine in treating bipolar I or II depression. The first studied 542 outpatients with acute bipolar depression, randomly assigned to quetiapine, 300 mg/day; quetiapine, 600 mg/day; or placebo. Mean changes in montgomery-asberg depression rating scale total scores were the primary outcome measures. Quetiapine showed dose-dependent improvement in montgomery-asberg depression rating scale total scores after the first week (P<.001), with a moderate clinical effect size of 0.67 at 300 mg/day and a large effect size of 0.81 at 600 mg/day."
"Do OTC remedies relieve cough in acute URIs
Acute cough due to upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) is a common symptom. Non-prescription over-the-counter (OTC) medicines are frequently recommended as a first-line treatment, but there is little evidence as to whether these drugs are effective. To assess the effects of oral OTC cough preparations for acute cough. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2006, Issue 4); MEDLINE (January 1966 to January Week 1, 2007); EMBASE (January 1974 to January 2007); and the UK Department of Health National Research Register (June 2007). Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing oral OTC cough preparations with placebo in children and adults suffering from acute cough in ambulatory settings. We considered all cough outcomes and second outcomes of interest were adverse effects. Two review authors independently screened potentially relevant citations and independently extracted data and assessed study quality. Quantitative analysis was performed where appropriate. Twenty five trials (17 in adults, 8 in children) involving 3492 people (2876 adults and 616 children) were included. RESULTS OF STUDIES IN ADULTS: Six trials compared antitussives with placebo and had variable results. Two trials compared the expectorant, guaifenesin with placebo, one indicated significant benefit whereas the other did not. One trial found that a mucolytic reduced cough frequency and symptom scores. Two studies examined antihistamine-decongestant combinations and found conflicting results. Three studies compared other combinations of drugs with placebo and indicated some benefit in reducing cough symptoms. Three trials found antihistamines were no more effective than placebo in relieving cough symptoms. RESULTS OF STUDIES IN CHILDREN: Antitussives (two studies), antihistamines (two studies), antihistamine decongestants (two studies) and antitussive/bronchodilator combinations (one study) were no more effective than placebo. No studies using expectorants met our inclusion criteria. The results of one trial favoured active treatment with mucolytics over placebo. One trial tested two paediatric cough syrups and both preparations showed a 'satisfactory response' in 46% and 56% of children compared to 21% of children in the placebo group. There is no good evidence for or against the effectiveness of OTC medicines in acute cough. The results of this review have to be interpreted with caution due differences in study characteristics and quality. Studies often showed conflicting results with uncertainty regarding clinical relevance. Higher quality evidence is needed to determine the effectiveness of self-care treatments for acute cough.","A Cochrane review found DM to be modestly effective in 2 of 3 studies. In the first study-a meta-analysis of 6 industry-sponsored RCTs of 710 adults-a single 30-mg dose of DM decreased coughing bouts by 12% (P=.004) and increased the time between bouts by 17 % (P=.002) in the 3 hours after treatment. A second study of 3 successive industry-sponsored, blinded RCTs enrolling a total of 451 adults found that 30 mg of DM decreased cough counts between 19% and 36% (P<.05) over a 3-hour follow-up period. Neither of the 2 studies specified whether the outcome assessors were blinded to treatment groups. A third double-blinded randomized controlled trials evaluating a single 30-mg dose of DM in 43 adults during a 3-hour follow-up period showed no statistically significant improvement in cough outcomes compared with placebo."
"How safe is vaginal birth after cesarean section for the mother and fetus
Trial of labor after previous cesarean delivery is associated with increased risk of uterine rupture. However, no reliable data exist on the effect of a trial of labor on the risk of perinatal death in otherwise uncomplicated term pregnancies. To determine the risk of intrapartum stillbirth or neonatal death not related to congenital abnormality among women with uncomplicated term pregnancies who had a trial of labor after previous cesarean delivery, compared with women having a planned repeat cesarean delivery, and multiparous and nulliparous women at term not delivered by planned cesarean method. Population-based, retrospective cohort study of data from the linked Scottish Morbidity Record and Stillbirth and Neonatal Death Enquiry encompassing births in Scotland between January 1, 1992, and December 31, 1997. A total of 313 238 singleton births between 37 and 43 weeks' gestational age in which the fetus was in a cephalic presentation. Delivery-related perinatal death, defined as intrapartum stillbirth or neonatal death unrelated to congenital anomaly, compared among the 4 groups. Among women who had a trial of labor following previous cesarean delivery (n = 15 515), the overall rate of delivery-related perinatal death was 12.9 (95% confidence interval [CI], 7.9-19.9) per 10 000 women. This was approximately 11 times greater (odds ratio [OR], 11.6; 95% CI, 1.6-86.7) than the risk associated with planned repeat cesarean delivery (n = 9014), more than twice (OR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.3-3.5) the risk associated with other multiparous women in labor (n = 151 549), and similar to the risk among nulliparous women in labor (n = 137 160; OR, 1.3; 95% CI, 0.8-2.1). The associations were not explained by differences in maternal height, smoking status, socioeconomic status, age, fetal growth, or week of gestation at delivery. Among women having a trial of labor, the rate of death due to mechanical causes, including uterine rupture, was 4.5 (95% CI, 1.8-9.3) per 10 000 women. This was more than 8 times greater than other multiparous women (OR, 8.5; 95% CI, 3.2-22.3) and nulliparous women (OR, 8.8; 95% CI, 3.2-24.2). The absolute risk of perinatal death associated with trial of labor following previous cesarean delivery is low. However, in our study, the risk was significantly higher than that associated with planned repeat cesarean delivery, and there was a marked excess of deaths due to uterine rupture compared with other women in labor.","The effect of vaginal birth after cesarean on neonatal morbidity and mortality is unclear. A small retrospective cohort of 24,529 births found a higher association of perinatal death for trial of labor (adjusted OR=11.7; 95% CI, 1.4-101.6). The perinatal death rate was similar to rates in nulliparous women."
"Is osteopathic manipulation effective for headaches
It is generally accepted that migraine is sensitive to intervention, whether in a treatment situation or in a clinical trial, and a ""placebo effect"" is often suggested. The influence of a number of non-specific therapeutic ingredients was examined in a recent six-month trial of cervical manipulation for migraine, and results of a 20-month follow-up are reported. During the trial migraine attacks reduced significantly by 28%, and reduced a further 19% up to the follow-up period. The possibility of a trial effect, whereby improvement might stem from circumstances of the trial, was dismissed as an explanation for improvement. There was some evidence to suggest that placebo influences made a slight contribution to improvement, with sex, social class and subjects' optimism about the therapist at the initial treatment being weakly associated with initial improvement. The possibility that improvement levels reflected spontaneous improvement in migraine symptoms is suggested. If this possibility proves valid, clinical trials assessing migraine therapies should be designed so as to consider the natural course of migraine. Degree of improvement at follow-up could be predicted clearly from degree of improvement during the treatment phase and from degree of improvement at the end of the trial. This appears to be important to manipulative therapists who appear to practise without the benefit of valid predictors of response to therapy.","A randomized controlled trials of migraine prophylaxis with 88 patients compared spinal manipulative therapy twice weekly for 8 weeks with mobilization techniques. At 8 weeks post-treatment, there was a nonsignificant trend favoring spinal manipulative therapy over mobilization in decreasing pain (ES=0.4; 95% CI, -0.2 to 1.0)."
"What is the role of tacrolimus and pimecrolimus in atopic dermatitis
This randomized, double-blind, multi-centre study compared the long-term safety and tolerability of pimecrolimus cream 1% and topical corticosteroids (TCS) in 658 adults with moderate-severe atopic dermatitis (AD). Patients applied either pimecrolimus or TCS (i.e. 0.1% triamcinolone acetonide cream and/or 1% hydrocortisone acetate cream) twice daily to all affected areas until complete clearance or for up to 1 year. The study was approved by the institutional review board or ethics committee at each centre. A majority of patients treated with either pimecrolimus or TCS used the drug on a continuous basis over 1 year. In patients who had >30% of the body surface involved by AD, the incidence rate of all skin infections was significantly lower in the pimecrolimus group than in the TCS group (95% CI of the treatment difference: -25.3% to -3.4%). The most frequent application site reaction was burning (25.9% of patients on pimecrolimus and 10.9% on TCS), which was transient and mild-moderate in most cases. Three TCS-treated patients reported skin striae. There were no treatment-related serious or clinically significant systemic adverse events. Efficacy was better in patients on continuous TCS therapy, although patients completing the study were similarly well-controlled in both groups. About 42% of the pimecrolimus-treated patients were maintained for 1 year without TCS. Pimecrolimus demonstrated a favourable safety profile when used to treat adult patients with moderate-severe AD for up to 1 year. A significant proportion of patients could be maintained without TCS for a year.","A randomized, double-blinded, multicenter trial compared the use of pimecrolimus 1% cream with 0.1% triamcinolone acetonide cream and 1% hydrocortisone acetate cream for 658 adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. The majority of patients used either form of treatment for 1 year. Although long-term safety and tolerability were similar, topical corticosteroids were more efficacious (NNT=13)."
"Which urinary tract infection therapies are safe and effective during breastfeeding
Sixty pregnant women with fetuses affected by beta-thalassemia major underwent termination of gestation induced by amniocentesis and intrauterine instillation of prostaglandin F2 alpha between 19 and 25 weeks. Pharmacokinetics of ciprofloxacin in maternal blood and amniotic fluid were studied after two doses of ciprofloxacin (200 mg intravenously every 12 hours), after two doses of pefloxacin (400 mg intravenously every 12 hours), and after two doses of ofloxacin (400 mg intravenously every 12 hours). Twenty patients were studied in each group. The ranges of mean maternal serum and amniotic fluid levels were as follows: ciprofloxacin in maternal serum 0.01 to 0.28 micrograms/ml, in amniotic fluid 0.1 to 0.13 micrograms/ml; pefloxacin in maternal serum 2.65 to 4.31 micrograms/ml, in amniotic fluid 1.97 to 2.74 micrograms/ml; and ofloxacin in maternal serum 0.07 to 0.68 micrograms/ml, in amniotic fluid 0.13 to 0.25 micrograms/ml. Three groups of lactating women (10 women in each), were given three doses of 750 mg ciprofloxacin orally, 400 mg pefloxacin orally, and 400 mg ofloxacin orally. Serum and milk samples were obtained simultaneously at two, four, six, nine, 12, and 24 hours after dosage administration. The mean breast milk levels of ciprofloxacin at the corresponding time intervals were 3.79, 2.26, 0.86, 0.51, 0.20, and 0.02 micrograms/ml. The mean breast milk levels of pefloxacin were 3.54, 3.43, 2.93, 2.24, 1.79, and 0.88 micrograms/ml, and of ofloxacin, 2.41, 1.91, 1.25, 0.64, 0.29, and 0.05 micrograms/ml. It is concluded that all studied quinolones penetrate the placenta and are found in amniotic fluid at low concentrations and at much higher levels in breast milk. Because of the potential for quinolones to cause arthropathy in juvenile animals, their use should be avoided in pregnant and lactating women.","A case series administered ciprofloxacin 750 mg, pefloxacin 400 mg, or ofloxacin 400 mg twice daily to 3 groups of 10 women each. Milk samples were obtained 6 times over 24 hours following the third dose of antibiotic. Maximum levels in breast milk occurred 2 hours after the dose, and were 3.79, 3.54, and 2.41 mcg/mL for ciprofloxacin, pefloxacin, and ofloxacin respectively. All 3 quinolones achieved higher concentrations in breast milk than in serum."
"For fibromyalgia, which treatments are the most effective
The optimal management of fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) is unclear and comprehensive evidence-based guidelines have not been reported. To provide up-to-date evidence-based guidelines for the optimal treatment of FMS. DATA SOURCES, SELECTION, AND EXTRACTION: A search of all human trials (randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials) of FMS was made using Cochrane Collaboration Reviews (1993-2004), MEDLINE (1966-2004), CINAHL (1982-2004), EMBASE (1988-2004), PubMed (1966-2004), Healthstar (1975-2000), Current Contents (2000-2004), Web of Science (1980-2004), PsychInfo (1887-2004), and Science Citation Indexes (1996-2004). The literature review was performed by an interdisciplinary panel, composed of 13 experts in various pain management disciplines, selected by the American Pain Society (APS), and supplemented by selected literature reviews by APS staff members and the Utah Drug Information Service. A total of 505 articles were reviewed. There are major limitations to the FMS literature, with many treatment trials compromised by short duration and lack of masking. There are no medical therapies that have been specifically approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for management of FMS. Nonetheless, current evidence suggests efficacy of low-dose tricyclic antidepressants, cardiovascular exercise, cognitive behavioral therapy, and patient education. A number of other commonly used FMS therapies, such as trigger point injections, have not been adequately evaluated. Despite the chronicity and complexity of FMS, there are pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions available that have clinical benefit. Based on current evidence, a stepwise program emphasizing education, certain medications, exercise, cognitive therapy, or all 4 should be recommended.","Single RCTs conducted on duloxetine and milnacipran, new SNRIs, demonstrated them to be more effective than placebo in improving pain and scores on the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ)."
"What is the most effective way for relieving constipation in children aged >1 year
Children with functional constipation and encopresis benefit from behavior modification and from long-term laxative medication. Polyethylene glycol without electrolytes has become the first option for many pediatric gastroenterologists. Twenty-eight children treated with polyethylene glycol without electrolytes were compared with 21 children treated with milk of magnesia to evaluate the efficiency, acceptability, side effects, and treatment dosage of polyethylene glycol in long-term treatment of functional constipation and encopresis. Children were rated as ""doing well,"" ""improved,"" or ""not doing well,"" depending on resolution of constipation and encopresis. At the 1-, 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-ups, bowel movement frequency increased and soiling frequency decreased significantly in both groups. At the 1-month follow-up, children on polyethylene glycol were soiling more frequently (P < 0.01) and fewer were improved (P < 0.01). At the 3- and 6-month follow-ups, both groups had similarly improved. At the 12-month visit, 61% of children on polyethylene glycol and 67% of children on milk of magnesia were doing well. Children on polyethylene glycol soiled more frequently (P < 0.01). None refused polyethylene glycol, but 33% refused to take milk of magnesia. The mean initial treatment dosage of polyethylene glycol was 0.6 +/- 0.2 g/kg daily. Polyethylene glycol had no taste, and no loss of efficacy occurred. Polyethylene glycol did not cause clinically significant side effects. Polyethylene glycol without electrolytes is an alternative for long-term management of children with constipation and encopresis.","A randomized trial compared polyethylene glycol with milk of magnesia in 49 children with functional constipation and encopresis. Follow-up at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months revealed similar effectiveness in increasing bowel movement frequency, decreasing soiling episodes, and decreasing abdominal pain. It also revealed that polyethylene glycol was more palatable and better-tolerated than milk of magnesia (33% of children refused to take milk of magnesia, whereas none refused PEG). No side effects from polyethylene glycol were reported."
"Do topical antibiotics improve wound healing
This paper is one of a series of eight systematic reviews that aim to identify effective interventions for chronic wounds. Here, antimicrobial agents are evaluated. Electronic databases and other relevant sources were accessed to identify published and unpublished material. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they used concurrent controls, recruited participants with chronic wounds, evaluated an intervention designed to prevent or treat chronic wounds, and incorporated an objective assessment of wound healing. All included studies were assessed against a comprehensive checklist for methodological quality. A narrative overview was conducted. Thirty trials were included, 25 of randomized design. Small sample size and other methodological problems meant that findings were often difficult to interpret. Results do not support the routine use of systemic antibiotics for leg ulcers or diabetic foot ulcers without acute infection, but they may be useful as an adjunct to surgery for pilonidal sinuses. Several topical preparations may be helpful, including dimethyl sulphoxide, silver sulphadiazine, benzoyl peroxide, oxyquinoline and gentamicin. Most of this research requires replication in larger, well designed studies to establish both clinical and cost effectiveness.","A systematic review of the treatment of chronic wounds, such as diabetic foot ulcers, found 30 trials, including 25 RCTs, mostly of low quality. Little evidence supports the routine use of systemic antibiotics for patients with chronic wounds; however, some topical antiseptic and antimicrobial agents may hasten the healing of these wounds. Topical preparations that may be helpful include dimethyl sulfoxide (Rimso-50), silver sulfadiazine (Silvadene), benzoyl peroxide (Benzac, Brevoxyl, Desquam, Triaz, ZoDerm), oxyquinoline (Trimo-san Vaginal Jelly), and gentamicin (Garamycin)."
"What is the best treatment for diabetic neuropathy
To study the effectiveness and safety aspects of sodium valproate in the management of painful neuropathy in patients of type 2 diabetes mellitus. A randomized double-blind placebo controlled trial of sodium valproate was done in type 2 diabetic patients to assess its efficacy and safety in the management of painful neuropathy. We screened 60 patients but eight patients could not complete the study; hence, the present study was done on 52 patients. Each patient was assessed by clinical examination, pain score by short form of the McGill pain questionnaire (SF-MPQ) and electrophysiological examination, which included motor and sensory nerve conduction velocity, amplitude and H-reflex initially and at the end of 1 month of treatment. Significant improvement was noticed in the pain score of patients receiving sodium valproate in comparison to patients receiving placebo at the end of 1 month (P < 0.05). The changes in electrophysiological data were not significant. The drug was well tolerated by all patients except one who developed a raised aspartate transaminase (AST)/alanine transaminase (ALT) level after 15 days of treatment. Sodium valproate is a well-tolerated drug and provides significant subjective improvement in painful diabetic neuropathy. These data provide a basis for future trials of longer duration in a larger group of patients.","A report did not allow calculation of NNT, but the findings were consistent with these results. Phenytoin dosage was 300 mg/d; carbamazepine dosage was titrated to 200-600 mg/d, gabapentin from 300-3600 mg/d, and valproate 1200 mg/d. Patients taking anticonvulsants did not have a higher rate of withdrawal compared to those taking placebo. Limited evidence suggests no significant differences among anticonvulsants; there is insufficient evidence to determine optimal dosage of any of these agents."
"Which complementary therapies can help patients with PMS
The aim of this double-blind and placebo-controlled trial was to investigate whether saffron (stigma of Crocus sativus L.) could relieve symptoms of premenstrual syndrome (PMS). Double-blind, randomised and placebo-controlled trial. Departments of Gynaecology/Obstetrics and Psychiatry, Tehran and Zanjan University of Medical Sciences. Women aged 20-45 years with regular menstrual cycles and experience of PMS symptoms for at least 6 months were eligible for the study. Women were randomly assigned to receive capsule saffron 30 mg/day (15 mg twice a day; morning and evening) (group A) or capsule placebo (twice a day) for a two menstrual cycles (cycles 3 and 4). The primary outcome measure was the Daily Symptom Report, and secondary outcome measure was the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. In this trial, saffron was found to be effective in relieving symptoms of PMS. A significant difference was observed in efficacy of saffron in cycles 3 and 4 in the Total Premenstrual Daily Symptoms and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. The results of this study indicate the efficacy of C. sativus L. in the treatment of PMS. However, a tolerable adverse effects profile of saffron may well confirm the application of saffron as an alternative treatment for PMS. These results deserved further investigations.","A double-blind randomized controlled trials evaluated the effect of 2 cycles of treatment with saffron (Crocus sativus L), 30 mg twice daily, on PMS symptoms in 50 patients. Nineteen patients in the saffron group showed a response, defined as 50% reduction in symptom severity, compared with 2 patients in the placebo group (NNT=2). The study found no statistically significant difference in frequency of adverse effects."
"What is the best way to manage benign paroxysmal positional vertigo
Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is a syndrome characterised by short-lived episodes of vertigo in association with rapid changes in head position. It is a common cause of vertigo presenting to primary care and specialist otolaryngology clinics. Current treatment approaches include rehabilitative exercises and physical manoeuvres including the Epley manoeuvre. To assess the effectiveness of the Epley manoeuvre compared to other treatments available for posterior canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, or no treatment. The Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (Cochrane Library, Issue 2 2001), MEDLINE (1966 onwards), EMBASE (1974 onwards), and reference lists of identified publications. Date of the most recent search was June 2001. Randomised trials of adults diagnosed with posterior canal BPPV (including a positive Dix-Hallpike test). Comparisons sought: - Epley manoeuvre versus placebo. - Epley manoeuvre versus untreated controls. Epley manoeuvre versus other active treatment. Outcome measures that were considered include: frequency and severity of attacks of vertigo; proportion of patients improved by each intervention; and conversion of a ""positive"" Dix-Hallpike test to a ""negative"" Dix-Hallpike test Both reviewers independently extracted data and assessed trials for quality. Eleven trials were identified but nine studies were excluded because of a high risk of bias, leaving two trials in the review. Trials were mainly excluded because of inadequate concealment during randomisation, or failure to blind outcome assessors. Both studies included in the review (Lynn 1995, Froehling 2000) addressed the efficacy of the Epley manoeuvre against a sham manoeuvre by comparing the proportion of subjects in each group who had complete resolution of their symptoms, and who converted from a positive to negative Dix-Hallpike test. Individual and pooled data showed a statistically significant effect in favour of the Epley manoeuvre over controls. There were no serious adverse effects of treatment. ~bullet~There is some evidence that the Epley manoeuvre is a safe effective treatment for posterior canal BPPV, although this is based on the results of only two small randomised controlled trials with relatively short follow up. ~bullet~There is no good evidence that the Epley manoeuvre provides a long term resolution of symptoms. ~bullet~There is no good evidence comparing the Epley manoeuvre with other physical, medical or surgical therapy for posterior canal BPPV.","Pooled data yielded odds ratios in favor of treatment for both objective testing (OR=5.67; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.21-14.56) and symptom resolution (OR=4.92; 95% CI, 1.84-13.16), with no adverse outcomes reported."
"What is the most effective treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in children
Studies examining interventions for adolescents diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) were reviewed to evaluate their efficacy. These efficacy findings were supplemented with a preliminary system for judging safety and practicality. Results suggest that the stimulant drug methylphenidate (MPH) is safe and well-established empirically, but has some problems with inconvenience and noncompliance. Preliminary research supports the efficacy, safety, and practicality of some psychotherapeutic interventions, including behavioral classroom interventions, note-taking training, and family therapy. Treatment with tricyclic antidepressants was judged to have minimal empirical support and debatable safety. Very little is known about long-term effectiveness of treatments, long-term compliance, or multimodal treatments for adolescents such as stimulants plus behavior therapy.",Several short-term reviews and meta-analyses show that side effects from stimulant medications are mild and have short duration. More long-term studies are required to evaluate effects on growth.
"What are the indications for tonsillectomy in children
Surgical removal of the tonsils (tonsillectomy) is a common but controversial ENT operation. To determine the effect of tonsillectomy in patients with chronic/recurrent acute tonsillitis. Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, Medline, Embase, bibliographies. Randomised controlled trials comparing tonsillectomy with non-surgical treatment in adults and children with chronic/recurrent acute tonsillitis. Trials which included reduction in the number and severity of tonsillitis and sore throat as main outcome measures. Two authors applied the inclusion/exclusion criteria independently. No trials evaluating the effectiveness of tonsillectomy in adults were identified. Two trials from Pittsburgh assessed tonsillectomy in children. Significant baseline differences between the surgical and non-surgical groups and the inclusion of children who also underwent adenoidectomy prevent firm conclusions being drawn from the fully published trial. Limited and insufficient information is available from the second study; further details are awaited. The effectiveness of tonsillectomy has not been formally evaluated. Further trials addressing relevant outcome measure are required.","Cochrane: ""There is no evidence from randomized controlled trials to guide the clinician in formulating the indications for surgery in adults or children."""

"Do statins cause myopathy
Statins (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors) are associated with skeletal muscle complaints, including clinically important myositis and rhabdomyolysis, mild serum creatine kinase (CK) elevations, myalgia with and without elevated CK levels, muscle weakness, muscle cramps, and persistent myalgia and CK elevations after statin withdrawal. We performed a literature review to provide a clinical summary of statin-associated myopathy and discuss possible mediating mechanisms. We also update the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reports on statin-associated rhabdomyolysis. Articles on statin myopathy were identified via a PubMed search through November 2002 and articles on statin clinical trials, case series, and review articles were identified via a PubMed search through January 2003. Adverse event reports of statin-associated rhabdomyolysis were also collected from the FDA MEDWATCH database. The literature review found that reports of muscle problems during statin clinical trials are extremely rare. The FDA MEDWATCH Reporting System lists 3339 cases of statin-associated rhabdomyolysis reported between January 1, 1990, and March 31, 2002. Cerivastatin was the most commonly implicated statin. Few data are available regarding the frequency of less-serious events such as muscle pain and weakness, which may affect 1% to 5% of patients. The risk of rhabdomyolysis and other adverse effects with statin use can be exacerbated by several factors, including compromised hepatic and renal function, hypothyroidism, diabetes, and concomitant medications. Medications such as the fibrate gemfibrozil alter statin metabolism and increase statin plasma concentration. How statins injure skeletal muscle is not clear, although recent evidence suggests that statins reduce the production of small regulatory proteins that are important for myocyte maintenance.","A pooled analysis of randomized controlled trials found similar myopathy rates in patients taking statins and placebo. Summarized myopathy data from 30 statin trials analyzed in a recent systematic review, shows similar myopathy rates in statin and placebo patients. There may be a lower myopathy rate in these trials than in routine clinical practice because of stricter exclusion criteria and more intense monitoring."
"What's the best diagnostic evaluation of night sweats
Hot flushes and night sweats are common symptoms experienced by menopausal women. Hormone therapy (HT), containing oestrogens alone or oestrogens together with progestogens in a cyclic or continuous regimen, is often recommended for their alleviation. To examine the effect of oral HT compared to placebo on these vasomotor symptoms and the risk of early onset side-effects. We searched the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders Group and Subfertility Group trials register (searched May 2002). This register is based on regular searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PsycINFO, the handsearching of 20 relevant journals and conference proceedings, and searches of several key grey literature sources. We also contacted all relevant pharmaceutical companies, The Journal of the International Menopause Society and Climacteric. Double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trials of oral HT for at least three months duration. Study quality and outcome data were assessed independently. Random effects models were considered appropriate due to the variety of trial methodologies. The meta-analyses were explored for sensitivity to trial quality and therapy duration. Symptom frequency and severity were assessed separately, together with withdrawals and side-effects. Frequency data were analysed using the Weighted Mean Difference (WMD) between treatment and placebo outcomes. For severity data, odds ratios were estimated from the proportional odds model. From 115 references originally identified, 24 trials meeting the selection criteria were included in the review. Study participants totaled 3,329. Trial duration ranged from three months to three years. There was a significant reduction in the weekly hot flush frequency for HT compared to placebo (WMD -17.92, 95% CI -22.86 to -12.99). This was equivalent to a 75% reduction in frequency (95% CI 64.3 to 82.3) for HT relative to placebo. Symptom severity was also significantly reduced compared to placebo (OR 0.13, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.23). Withdrawal for lack of efficacy occurred significantly more often on placebo therapy (OR 10.51, 95% CI 5.00 to 22.09). Withdrawal for adverse events, commonly breast tenderness, oedema, joint pain and psychological symptoms, was not significantly increased (OR 1.25, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.90), although the occurrence of any adverse events was significantly increased for HT (OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.99). In women who were randomised to placebo treatment, a 57.7% (95% CI 45.1 to 67.7) reduction in hot flushes was observed between baseline and end of study. Oral HT is highly effective in alleviating hot flushes and night sweats. Therapies purported to reduce such symptoms must be assessed in blinded trials against a placebo or a validated therapy because of the large placebo effect seen in well conducted randomised controlled trials, and also because during menopause symptoms may fluctuate and after menopause symptoms often decline. Withdrawals due to side-effects were only marginally increased in the HT groups despite the inability to tailor HT in these fixed dose trials. Comparisons of hormonal doses, product types or regimens require analysis of trials with these specific ""within study"" comparisons.",A large Cochrane meta-analysis found that oral hormone therapy-estrogens alone or estrogens with progesterone-reduced the frequency of night sweats associated with hot flashes among menopausal women by 75% when compared with placebo alone.
"Do topical antibiotics improve wound healing
An investigation on the natural history of streptococcal skin infection was done in fifty-nine children in a rural day care setting. A double-blind study for prevention of streptococcal pyoderma was done during the peak season for skin infection. Triple antibiotic ointment, containing bacitracin, polysporin, and neomycin, was compared to placebo ointment. Ointments were applied thrice daily for minor skin trauma; mosquito bites and abrasions were predominant. Cultures of normal skin surfaces were taken for group A streptococci each week of the 15-week study period. Skin lesions were cultured whenever present. Eighty-one percent of the fifty-nine patients had positive normal skin cultures on one or more occasions. Nineteen children (32%) developed streptococcal pyoderma. Infection occurred significantly more often in children using placebo ointment than in those using topical antibiotic (47% vs 15%; p = 0.01). The infecting strain was first recovered from normal skin surfaces in 67% of placebo patients and in two of the four patients using antibiotic ointment. This study further confirms the importance of skin carriage of group A streptococci as a precursor to pyoderma and demonstrates the importance of minor skin trauma as a predisposing factor. Topical antibiotics may be useful in preventing streptococcal pyoderma, especially in children known to be at increased risk for such infection.",A double-blind study of 59 patients found Neosporin superior to placebo ointment in the prevention of streptococcal pyoderma for children with minor wounds. Infection occurred in 47% of placebo-treated children compared with 15% treated with the triple-antibiotic ointment (NNT=32; P=.01).
"What are effective medication combinations for dyslipidemia
Ezetimibe is the first of a new class of antihyperlipidemic agents, the cholesterol-absorption inhibitors. It is indicated for monotherapy or in combination with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A-reductase inhibitors (statins) in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia, in combination with simvastatin or atorvastatin in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, and as monotherapy in patients with homozygous familial sitosterolemia. This article reviews available data on the clinical pharmacology, clinical efficacy, and tolerability of ezetimibe. A literature review was conducted using the search terms ezetimibe and SCH 58235 to identify articles and abstracts indexed in MEDLINE and the Iowa Drug Information Service from 1966 to February 2003. The reference lists of the identified articles were reviewed for additional publications. In adults, ezetimibe 10 mg PO given once daily has been reported to reduce intestinal cholesterol absorption by 54% from baseline in association with a compensatory increase in endogenous cholesterol synthesis. Within 2 weeks of its initiation, ezetimibe monotherapy produced a 17% to 20% reduction from baseline in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C); in combination with statins, ezetimibe produced a reduction in LDL-C of up to 40% over the same period. Based on studies performed to date, ezetimibe appears to be well tolerated, with a safety profile similar to that of placebo. Because ezetimibe is eliminated primarily by glucuronidation and not by cytochrome P450 (CYP) oxidation, it is subject to minimal drug interactions involving the CYP enzyme system. Ezetimibe is an option for monotherapy in patients with mild hypercholesterolemia or in those requiring adjunctive drug therapy for reduction of LDL-C levels. It may be useful in patients at risk for adverse events (eg, liver toxicity, myopathy) from other hypocholesterolemic agents. Additive LDL-C-lowering effects of ezetimibe may allow use of lower doses of conventional agents (eg, statins, fibric acid derivatives, niacin) to achieve an equivalent effect, thereby reducing the potential for adverse events and drug interactions. However, because trials have lasted no longer than 12 weeks, the long-term effect of ezetimibe on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality remains to be determined.","Statin/ezetimibe combination therapy is FDA-approved, and provides an additional 12% to 21% absolute low density lipoprotein cholesterol reduction."
"When should we treat isolated high triglycerides
An acute and potentially life-threatening complication of hypertriglyceridemia (HTG) is acute pancreatitis (AP). Hypertriglyceridemia, usually severe, may be primary in origin or secondary to alcohol abuse, diabetes mellitus, pregnancy, and use of drugs. The efficacy of treatment to prevent relapses in 17 patients with AP attributed to HTG was investigated in the current prospective study. The mean follow-up period of patients was 42 months. Hypertriglyceridemia-induced AP comprised 6.9% of all patients with AP (n = 246) hospitalized in our clinic during the study (6 years). Causative conditions of HTG-induced AP were familial HTG in eight patients, HTG caused by uncontrolled diabetes mellitus in five, HTG aggravated by drugs in two (one by tamoxifen and one by fluvastatin), familial hyperchylomicronemia (HCM) in one, and lipemia of pregnancy in one. During the acute phase of pancreatitis, patients underwent standard treatment. Thereafter, HTG was efficiently controlled with high dosages of fibrates or a fibrate plus acipimox, except for the patient with HCM, who was on a specific diet (the only source of fat was a special oil consisting of medium chain triglyceride) and taking a high dosage of acipimox. One of the patients died during the acute phase of pancreatitis with acute respiratory distress syndrome. During follow-up, maintenance treatment was successful and only one patient relapsed, because he discontinued diet and drug treatment. Appropriate diet and drug treatment, including dose titration, of severe HTG is very effective in preventing relapses of HTG-induced AP.",Epidemiologic evidence suggests that patients with triglyceride levels of 500 to 1000 mg/dL may have an increased risk of pancreatitis.
"What is the best way to evaluate and manage diarrhea in the febrile infant
Oral rehydration solution (ORS) has reduced childhood deaths from diarrhoea in many countries. Recent studies suggest that the currently recommended formulation of ORS recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) may not be optimal, and solutions that contain lower concentrations of sodium and glucose may be more effective. To compare reduced osmolarity ORS with WHO standard ORS in children with acute diarrhoea. The Cochrane Collaboration Trials Register (on The Cochrane Library, Issue 2, 2001), MEDLINE (1966 to June 2001), EMBASE (1988 to May 2001), and Current Contents (June 2001) were searched. Additional trials were identified by hand searching. Content experts were contacted. Randomized controlled trials comparing reduced osmolarity ORS with the WHO standard ORS formulation. The primary outcome was unscheduled intravenous fluid infusion. Secondary outcomes were measures of clinical illness. Two reviewers extracted data. We tested for heterogeneity using the Chi-square statistic, conducted sensitivity analysis by allocation concealment, and the regression approach to assess funnel plot asymmetry from selective trial publication. The primary outcome, unscheduled intravenous fluid infusion, was reported in 11 trials. In a meta-analysis of 8 trials, reduced osmolarity ORS was associated with fewer unscheduled intravenous fluid infusions compared with WHO standard ORS (Mantel Haenzel odds ratio 0.59, 95% confidence interval 0.45 to 0.79) with no evidence for heterogeneity between trials. No unscheduled intravenous fluid infusion therapy was required in any participant in three trials. Eleven trials reported stool output, and data suggested less stool output in the reduced osmolarity ORS group. Vomiting was less frequent in the reduced osmolarity group in the six trials reporting this. Six trials sought hyponatraemia, with events in three studies, but no obvious difference between the two arms. In children admitted to hospital with diarrhoea, reduced osmolarity ORS when compared to WHO standard ORS is associated with fewer unscheduled intravenous fluid infusions, lower stool volume post randomization, and less vomiting. No additional risk of developing hyponatraemia when compared with WHO standard ORS was detected.","In a systematic review of RCTs comparing lower-concentration oral rehydrating solution with standard World Health Organization solution, lower-concentration solution showed superior efficacy. These resulted in fewer unscheduled infusions of IV fluids (OR=0.59; 95% CI, 0.45-0.79) and less stool output without increasing the incidence of hyponatremia."
"Do hyaluronic acid injections relieve OA knee pain
To compare the efficacy and safety of intraarticular hylan and 2 hyaluronic acids (HAs) in osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee. This was a multicenter, patient-blind, randomized controlled trial in 660 patients with symptomatic knee OA. Patients were randomly assigned to receive 1 cycle of 3 intraarticular injections per knee of 1 of 3 preparations: a high molecular weight cross-linked hylan, a non-cross-linked medium molecular weight HA of avian origin, or a non-cross-linked low molecular weight HA of bacterial origin. The primary outcome measure was the change in the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) pain score at 6 months. Secondary outcome measures included local adverse events (effusions or flares) in injected knees. During months 7-12, patients were offered a second cycle of viscosupplementation. Pain relief was similar in all 3 groups. The difference in changes between baseline and 6 months between hylan and the combined HAs was 0.1 on the WOMAC pain score (95% confidence interval [95% CI] -0.2, 0.3). No relevant differences were observed in any of the secondary efficacy outcomes, and stratified analyses provided no evidence for differences in effects across different patient groups. There was a trend toward more local adverse events in the hylan group than in the HA groups during the first cycle (difference 2.2% [95% CI -2.4, 6.7]), and this trend became more pronounced during the second cycle (difference 6.4% [95% CI 0.6, 12.2]). We found no evidence for a difference in efficacy between hylan and HAs. In view of its higher costs and potential for more local adverse events, we see no rationale for the continued use of hylan in patients with knee OA.","A Cochrane review determined that not enough evidence existed to evaluate HA products against each other. An RCTs compared HA products and found no differences in efficacy. The study compared Synvisc, Orthovisc, and Ostenil therapy in 660 patients over 6 months."
"Which factors increase the risk of an infant becoming an overweight child
To determine whether a rapid rate of weight gain in early infancy is associated with overweight status in childhood. Prospective, cohort study from birth to age 7 years. Twelve sites across the United States. Twenty-seven thousand, eight hundred ninety-nine (27 899) eligible participants born at full term between 1959 and 1965. Overweight status at age 7 years, defined by a body mass index above the 95th percentile of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reference data. In the 19 397 participants with complete data (69.6%), the prevalence of overweight status at age 7 years was 5.4%. The rate of weight gain during the first 4 months of life (as 100 g/month) was associated with being overweight at age 7 years, after adjustment for several confounding factors: odds ratio: 1.38; 95% confidence interval: 1.32-1.44. This association was present in each birth weight quintile, and remained significant after adjustment for the weight attained at age 1 year (odds ratio: 1.17; 95% confidence interval: 1.11-1.24). A pattern of rapid weight gain during the first 4 months of life was associated with an increased risk of overweight status at age 7 years, independent of birth weight and weight attained at age 1 year. These findings may lead to new hypotheses regarding the cause of childhood obesity, which may contribute to our understanding of this increasing public health problem in the United States.","A large cohort study found that each 100 g per month increase in weight gain above the mean (820 g per month) during the first 4 months of life increased the odds of overweight at 7 years of age by 38% (OR=1.38; 95% CI, 1.32-1.44)."
"What are effective treatments for oppositional defiant behaviors in adolescents
The authors sought to replicate open-label findings showing that specific criteria for explosive temper and mood lability identify disruptive youth who improve while receiving the anticonvulsant divalproex sodium. Twenty outpatient children and adolescents (ages 10-18) with a disruptive behavior disorder (oppositional defiant disorder or conduct disorder) met the specific criteria for explosive temper and mood lability. They received 6 weeks of divalproex treatment and 6 weeks of placebo by random assignment. Independent evaluators blind to group assignment assessed response at the end of each phase. At the end of phase 1, eight of 10 subjects had responded to divalproex; zero of 10 had responded to placebo. Of the 15 subjects who completed both phases, 12 has superior response taking divalproex. This preliminary study replicates open-label findings showing that divalproex is an efficacious treatment for explosive temper and mood lability in disruptive children and adolescents.","A double-blind crossover randomized controlled trials evaluated divalproex (Depakote) vs placebo for 20 children (aged 10 to 18 years) with explosive temper and mood lability who also met DSM-IV criteria for either oppositional defiant disorder or conduct disorder. Patients with significant medical problems, such as bipolar disorder, major depression, or mental retardation, were excluded. Divalproex significantly (P=.003) reduced aggressive behaviors and anger-hostility items by approximately 33% as reported by child, parent, school, and clinician on 2 standardized scales."
"What is the best way to evaluate an acute traumatic knee injury
To derive a highly sensitive decision rule for the selective use of radiography in acute knee injuries. Prospectively administered survey. Emergency departments of two university hospitals. Convenience sample of 1,047 adults with acute knee injuries. Attending emergency physicians assessed each patient for 23 standardized clinical findings, which were recorded on data collection forms. A total of 127 patients was examined independently by two physicians to determine interobserver agreement. The outcome measure was fracture of the knee. Any patients who did not have ED radiography underwent a structured telephone interview to determine the possibility of a missed fracture. Those variables found to be both reliable (highest kappa values) and strongly associated with a fracture (highest chi 2 values) were further analyzed by a recursive-partitioning multivariate technique. The derived decision rule included the following variables: (1) age 55 years or older, (2) tenderness at the head of the fibula, (3) isolated tenderness of the patella, (4) inability to flex to 90 degrees, and (5) inability to bear weight both immediately and in the ED (four steps). The presence of one or more of these findings would have identified the 68 fractures in the study population with a sensitivity of 1.0 (95% confidence interval [Cl], .95 to 1.0) and a specificity of .54 (95% Cl, .51 to .57). Application of the rule would have led to a 28.0% relative reduction in the use of radiography from 68.6% to 49.4% in the study population. A practical, highly sensitive, and reliable decision rule for the use of radiography in acute knee injuries has been derived. Clinical application should await prospective validation of the rule.","The Ottawa Knee Rules recommend knee x-rays for any patient meeting one of these criteria: 1) ≥55 years of age. 2) Tenderness over the head of the fibula or isolated to the patella without other bony tenderness. 3) Unable to flex the knee to 90º, or unable to bear weight (for at least 4 steps) both immediately and in the emergency department."
"Does ambulatory blood pressure monitoring aid in the management of patients with hypertension
The aim of the present study has been to study the reproducibility, validity and normal values of ambulatory blood pressure measurement in a healthy Finnish cohort. The reproducibility of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring was examined in healthy volunteers and normal values were determined in a Finnish cohort of males and women of different ages. In the reproducibility study the recording was repeated at 2-week intervals. In the validity study simultaneous measurements were done manually with a mercury sphygmomanometer and compared with the measurement by the ambulatory blood pressure recording unit, both connected with the cuff by a T-tube; this study included 100 consecutive measurements in a patient group. A relatively small cohort was taken from the normal value study group. In addition to ambulatory blood pressure their left ventricle mass was also determined by echocardiography. The correlation between manual blood pressure measurement and simultaneous measurement by the ambulatory blood pressure unit was 0.98. In the reproducibility study the correlations between the two 24-h measurements 2 weeks apart were also good. Depending on the parameter (daytime, nighttime or 24-h blood pressure mean, systolic or diastolic values) the correlation coefficient varied between 0.81 and 0.91. Thus both systolic and diastolic blood pressures, whether expressed as 24-h averages and daytime or nighttime averages, correlated well between these two recording sessions. The data obtained in the present Finnish cohort were well within the published reference value limits, showing only fairly modest age-dependence appearing at quite an old age. There was no significant correlation between the left ventricle mass and ambulatory blood pressure values in a population having normal blood pressure. The results suggest good intra-individual correlation and reproducibility in ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, suggesting this method to be useful in the monitoring of individual blood pressure levels. The validity of the method is good and the published reference values can be applied with reasonable reliability in different populations. In an adult population with normal blood pressure, no correlation between left ventricle mass and blood pressure values can be found, suggesting this correlation may first appear in cohorts including persons with elevated blood pressure values.",Community-based cohort studies have consistently shown ambulatory blood pressure monitoring to be more reproducible than office blood pressure measurements.
"Should induction of labor be considered in a woman with a macrosomic baby
Macrosomia at term is associated with increased maternal and neonatal morbidity, including a higher rate of cesarean delivery and shoulder dystocia. Induction of labor has been suggested as a means to prevent further weight gain and improve outcome. The aim of this study was to determine whether or not induction of labor in these cases improves maternal and neonatal outcome. Patients at term with an ultrasonic fetal weight estimation of 4000-4500 g were prospectively randomized into two groups: induction of labor (group D and expectant management (group II). Patients with diabetes, a previous cesarean delivery, or nonvertex presentation were excluded. Outcome variables included mode of delivery, arterial cord pH, presence of shoulder dystocia, brachial plexus injury, clavicular fracture, cephalohematoma, and intraventricular hemorrhage. Of 273 patients who were eligible for the study, 134 were randomized to group I and 139 to group II. Parity, gestational age, and fetal weight estimation were similar in the two groups. The neonates of group II patients were significantly heavier (4132.8 +/- 347.4 versus 4062.8 +/- 306.9 g; P = .024). The rate of cesarean delivery was 19.4% in group I and 21.6% in group II patients (not significant [NS]). Cord pH was similar in both groups. Shoulder dystocia was diagnosed in five group I and six group II patients (NS). None developed brachial plexus injury. There were two cases of mild, transient brachial plexus injury in group II patients without documented shoulder dystocia. Mild intraventricular hemorrhage was diagnosed in three of 44 group I and two of 31 group II neonates evaluated (NS). In this prospective, randomized study, induction of labor for suspected macrosomia at term did not decrease the rate of cesarean delivery or reduce neonatal morbidity. Ultrasonic estimation of fetal weight between 4000 and 4500 g should not be considered an indication for induction of labor.","Gonen and colleagues followed 273 women at 38 weeks or more with ultrasound-determined fetal weights between 4000 and 4500 g. Women were excluded if they had diabetes, noncephalic presentations, a previous cesarean delivery, or other indications for induction. The induction group received either prostaglandin or pitocin for induction, depending on cervical status. Patients in the expectant management group were induced at 42 weeks. There was no change in cesarean delivery rate or in neonatal morbidity."
"What precautions should we use with statins for women of childbearing age
Several clinical trials have evaluated the effects of lipid-lowering medications on coronary heart disease (CHD). Many of the trials have not included enough women to allow sex-specific analyses or have not reported results in women separately. To assess and synthesize the evidence regarding drug treatment of hyperlipidemia for the prevention of CHD events in women and to conduct a meta-analysis of the effect of drug treatment on mortality. We searched MEDLINE, the Cochrane Database, and the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness for articles published from 1966 through December 2003. We reviewed reference lists of articles and consulted content experts. Studies of outpatients that had a treatment duration of at least 1 year, assessed the impact of lipid lowering on clinical outcomes, and reported results by sex were included. Outcomes evaluated were total mortality, CHD mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction, revascularization, and total CHD events. Summary estimates of the relative risks (RRs) with therapy were calculated using a random-effects model for patients with and without a previous history of cardiovascular disease. Thirteen studies were included. Six trials included a total of 11 435 women without cardiovascular disease and assessed the effects of lipid-lowering medications. Lipid lowering did not reduce total mortality (RR, 0.95; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.62-1.46), CHD mortality (RR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.47-2.40), nonfatal myocardial infarction (RR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.22-1.68), revascularization (RR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.33-2.31), or CHD events (RR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.69-1.09). However, some analyses were limited by too few CHD events in the available trials. Eight trials included 8272 women with cardiovascular disease and assessed the effects of lipid-lowering medications. Lipid lowering did not reduce total mortality in women with cardiovascular disease (RR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.77-1.29). However, lipid lowering reduced CHD mortality (RR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.55-1.00), nonfatal myocardial infarction (RR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.58-0.87), revascularization (RR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.55-0.89), and total CHD events (RR, 0.80; CI, 0.71-0.91). For women without cardiovascular disease, lipid lowering does not affect total or CHD mortality. Lipid lowering may reduce CHD events, but current evidence is insufficient to determine this conclusively. For women with known cardiovascular disease, treatment of hyperlipidemia is effective in reducing CHD events, CHD mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and revascularization, but it does not affect total mortality.","A meta-analysis evaluated the benefits of lipid-lowering medication in trials of at least 1 year duration that included women. Total and coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction, revascularization, and total coronary heart disease events were assessed among women with and without cardiovascular disease (CVD). Ten trials included statins. Of the 5 studies that reported age, the average was 61 years. For women without CVD, lipid-lowering treatment was not shown to affect total or coronary heart disease mortality. For women with known CVD, hyperlipidemia treatment did not affect total mortality, but was shown effective in reducing coronary heart disease events, coronary heart disease mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and revascularization; the relative risk of coronary heart disease events for statin users was 0.80 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.71-0.91). The number of women needed to treat (NNT) to prevent an initial coronary heart disease event was 140. For secondary prevention, the number needed to treat to prevent 1 coronary heart disease event was 26. Since women of child-bearing potential have lower probability of coronary heart disease events compared to the older women studied in this meta-analysis, the expected benefit for younger women is likely to be substantially lower."
"Can type 2 diabetes be prevented through diet and exercise
Individuals with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) have a high risk of developing NIDDM. The purpose of this study was to determine whether diet and exercise interventions in those with IGT may delay the development of NIDDM, i.e., reduce the incidence of NIDDM, and thereby reduce the overall incidence of diabetic complications, such as cardiovascular, renal, and retinal disease, and the excess mortality attributable to these complications. In 1986, 110,660 men and women from 33 health care clinics in the city of Da Qing, China, were screened for IGT and NIDDM. Of these individuals, 577 were classified (using World Health Organization criteria) as having IGT. Subjects were randomized by clinic into a clinical trial, either to a control group or to one of three active treatment groups: diet only, exercise only, or diet plus exercise. Follow-up evaluation examinations were conducted at 2-year intervals over a 6-year period to identify subjects who developed NIDDM. Cox's proportional hazard analysis was used to determine if the incidence of NIDDM varied by treatment assignment. The cumulative incidence of diabetes at 6 years was 67.7% (95% CI, 59.8-75.2) in the control group compared with 43.8% (95% CI, 35.5-52.3) in the diet group, 41.1% (95% CI, 33.4-49.4) in the exercise group, and 46.0% (95% CI, 37.3-54.7) in the diet-plus-exercise group (P < 0.05). When analyzed by clinic, each of the active intervention groups differed significantly from the control clinics (P < 0.05). The relative decrease in rate of development of diabetes in the active treatment groups was similar when subjects were stratified as lean or overweight (BMI < or > or = 25 kg/m2). In a proportional hazards analysis adjusted for differences in baseline BMI and fasting glucose, the diet, exercise, and diet-plus-exercise interventions were associated with 31% (P < 0.03), 46% (P < 0.0005), and 42% (P < 0.005) reductions in risk of developing diabetes, respectively. Diet and/or exercise interventions led to a significant decrease in the incidence of diabetes over a 6-year period among those with IGT.","The Da Qing impaired glucose tolerance and Diabetes Study divided 577 patients with impaired glucose tolerance into 1 control and 3 intervention groups: diet, aerobic exercise, and combined diet plus aerobic exercise. Patients in this study had the lowest average body mass index (25.8) of the 3 studies. The intervention group received individual and group counseling sessions at weekly intervals for 1 month, then monthly for 3 months, and then every 3 months. The control group received generalized information on impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes but individual or group instruction was not included. At the 6-year follow-up, the quantity of exercise was significantly higher in the exercise intervention groups, but no significant difference in caloric intake was seen among all 4 groups. The incidence of diabetes in the exercise intervention group was approximately half that in the control group overall. Exercise was more effective in reducing diabetes in lean patients (BMI <25), but both lean and overweight patients benefited. The combination of diet plus exercise and diet changes also significantly reduced diabetes, although to a lesser degree."
"What is the role of combination therapy insulin plus oral medication in type 2 diabetes
To study the effect on body weight and glycaemic control of two insulin treatment regimens in patients with Type 2 diabetes and moderate failure to oral hypoglycaemic agents. Sixteen patients treated with oral hypoglycaemic agents (6 men and 10 women) were included in this open-label, randomized, parallel group study. Their age was 62 +/- 2 (mean +/- SEM) years (range 44-79 years), body weight 71.3 +/- 2.9 kg, body mass index (BMI) 24.6 +/- 0.8 kg/m(2). The patients were switched to insulin treatment with bedtime NPH insulin combined with daytime sulphonylurea (combination group) or twice daily injections of a premixed combination of regular human and NPH insulin (insulin twice daily group) with measurements as given below before and after 12 and 24 weeks of treatment. HbA(1c) was lowered from 8.3 +/- 0.3% to 7.0 +/- 0.2% in the insulin twice daily group (p<0.05) and from 8.3 +/- 0.3% to 6.8 +/- 0.5% in the combination group (p<0.03; ns between treatment groups). Body weight increased from 71.7 +/- 4.0 kg to 77.6 +/- 4.4 kg in the insulin twice daily group (p<0.001) and from 70.8 +/- 4.6 kg to 72.7 +/- 5.1 kg in the combination group (ns; p<0.02 between groups). The dose of insulin at 24 weeks in the insulin twice daily group was 45.8 +/- 4.2 U and 29.4 +/- 5.4 U in the combination group (p=0.03). Combination treatment reduced fasting and stimulated C-peptide levels. Both treatments improved glycaemic control to the same extent but the combination of bedtime NPH insulin and daytime sulphonylurea gave a very small increase of body weight over a 6 months period. We conclude that combination therapy is an attractive alternative when starting insulin treatment in patients with Type 2 diabetes as this is a critical period for weight gain in such patients.","Mean weight gain was similar in all 3 groups but only a minority of patients reached a target HbA1c of 6.5%. In the final study of only 16 patients, HbA1c after 6 months improved significantly and equally in both groups (baseline: 8.3%, combination therapy final: 6.8%; insulin alone final: 7.0%). However, the combination therapy group gained significantly less weight."
"What steps can reduce morbidity and mortality caused by hip fractures
Randomized, controlled trials have shown that prophylactic antibiotics are effective in preventing surgical-wound infections. However, it is uncertain how the timing of antibiotic administration affects the risk of surgical-wound infection in actual clinical practice. We prospectively monitored the timing of antibiotic prophylaxis and studied the occurrence of surgical-wound infections in 2847 patients undergoing elective clean or ""clean-contaminated"" surgical procedures at a large community hospital. The administration of antibiotics 2 to 24 hours before the surgical incision was defined as early; that during the 2 hours before the incision, as preoperative; that during the 3 hours after the incision, as perioperative; and that more than 3 but less than 24 hours after the incision, as postoperative. Of the 1708 patients who received the prophylactic antibiotics preoperatively, 10 (0.6 percent) subsequently had surgical-wound infections. Of the 282 patients who received the antibiotics perioperatively, 4 (1.4 percent) had such infections (P = 0.12; relative risk as compared with the preoperatively treated group, 2.4; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.9 to 7.9). Of 488 patients who received the antibiotics postoperatively, 16 (3.3 percent) had wound infections (P less than 0.0001; relative risk, 5.8; 95 percent confidence interval, 2.6 to 12.3). Finally, of 369 patients who had antibiotics administered early, 14 (3.8 percent) had wound infections (P less than 0.0001; relative risk, 6.7; 95 percent confidence interval, 2.9 to 14.7). Stepwise logistic-regression analysis confirmed that the administration of antibiotics in the preoperative period was associated with the lowest risk of surgical-wound infection. We conclude that in surgical practice there is considerable variation in the timing of prophylactic administration of antibiotics and that administration in the two hours before surgery reduces the risk of wound infection.","Classen et al found that patients treated less than 2 hours before surgery had a 0.6% rate of infection (10/1208), compared with a 3.85% rate for those treated 2 to 24 hours ahead (14/369) (NNT=31)."
"What is the most effective treatment for acute low back pain
Low back pain is a common reason for consulting a general practitioner, and advice on daily activities constitutes an important part in the primary care management of low back pain. To assess the effects of bed rest for patients with acute low back pain or sciatica. We searched the Cochrane Musculoskeletal Group trial register, Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, MEDLINE, Embase, Sport, Scisearch, and reference lists of relevant articles. We also contacted authors of relevant articles. Date of the most recent searches: December 1998. We included all randomised studies or quasi randomised studies where at least one comparison group of adult patients with acute low back pain with or without radiation of pain below the knee was advised to rest in bed for at least two days and one group was not, or where comparison groups were advised to stay in bed for different lengths of time. The main outcomes of interest were pain, functional status, recovery and return to work. Two reviewers independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed the validity of included trials and extracted data. Investigators were contacted to obtain missing information. Nine trials with a total of 1435 patients were included. Five trials met all four validity criteria and were assessed to have low risk of bias, while four trials were assessed to have moderate to high risk of bias. Four trials compared bed rest with advice to stay active, and overall the results were heterogeneous. Overall results from two high quality studies indicate no difference in pain intensity at three weeks follow-up [Standardized Mean Difference 0.0 (95%CI: -0.3, 0.2)], and a small difference in functional status in favour of staying active [Weighted Mean Difference 3.2 (on a 0-100 scale) (95%CI 0.6, 5.8)]. Two high quality trials reported no differences in pain intensity between two to three days of bed rest and seven days of bed rest. Another two high-quality trials found no differences between bed rest and exercises in pain intensity or functional status. Bed rest compared to acvice to stay active will at best have small effects, and at worst might have small harmful effects on acute LBP. Differences in effects of advice to stay in bed compared with advice to stay active are small for patients with low back pain with or without sciatica. There is not an important difference in the effects of bed rest compared with exercises in the treatment of acute low back pain, or seven days compared with two to three days of bed rest in patients with low back pain of different duration with and without radiating pain.","According to a systematic review, there is no difference in pain intensity at 3 weeks' follow-up between active patients and patients for whom variable lengths of short-term bed rest for treatment of acute low back pain have been prescribed."
"Which treatments work best for hemorrhoids
This study was a retrospective analysis of complication rates, symptom recurrence, long-term results, and patient satisfaction after outpatient excision (local anesthesia) of thrombosed external hemorrhoids. From 1995 to 2000, 340 patients (166 males) underwent office-based excision of thrombosed external hemorrhoids under local anesthesia. Data regarding complications, operations because of recurrence, residual symptoms, patient's satisfaction with anesthesia, and wound treatment were obtained by questionnaire. Response was solicited at a minimum of 9 months postprocedure. Complete follow-up data was available in 88 percent of patients (mean follow-up, 17.3 months). Recurrent thrombosed external hemorrhoid requiring a procedure developed in 22 (6.5 percent) patients. Other complications that required operative intervention were one (0.3 percent) incidence of postoperative bleeding and seven (2.1 percent) perianal abscess/fistula. The majority of patients (66 percent) had no anal complaints at follow-up. Local anesthesia would be preferred if a repeat excision was required in 79 percent, whereas 11 percent would prefer another form of anesthesia and 10 percent were unsure. Outpatient excision under local anesthesia of a thrombosed external hemorrhoid can be safely performed with a low recurrence and complication rate while offering a high level of patient of acceptance and satisfaction.",A retrospective analysis of 340 patients who underwent outpatient excision of thrombosed external hemorrhoids under local anesthesia reported a low recurrence rate of 6.5% at a mean follow-up of 17.3 months.
"What are effective treatments for panic disorder
Serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are now considered the first-line pharmacotherapy for panic disorder. The preferential use and the presumption of greater tolerability of SSRIs relative to older agents, such as tricyclic antidepressants, occurred without direct comparisons between the two classes of medication. In this study the authors used an effect-size analysis to provide an initial comparison. The authors conducted an effect-size analysis of 12 placebo-controlled, efficacy trials of SSRIs for panic disorder and compared these results to findings obtained in a recent meta-analysis of non-SSRI treatments for panic disorder. The mean effect size for acute treatment outcome for SSRIs relative to placebo was 0.55, not significantly different from that for antidepressants in general (0.55) and for imipramine in particular (0.48). More recent studies of SSRIs, and studies using larger samples, were associated with lower effect sizes. No significant differences were found in dropout rates between those taking SSRIs and those taking older agents during acute treatment. An effect-size analysis of controlled studies of treatments for panic disorder revealed no significant differences between SSRIs and older antidepressants in terms of efficacy or tolerability in short-term trials. An inverse relationship was evident between sample size and effect size for SSRIs. Early studies of small samples may have led to initial overestimations of the efficacy of SSRIs for panic disorder.",SSRIs were equivalent to imipramine or alprazolam in an effect-size analysis.
"What's the best strategy for bipolar disorder during pregnancy
There are obvious gaps in research surrounding issues specific to women who suffer from bipolar disorder, including gender differences and their implications for management, the impact of the reproductive cycle, and evidence based treatment guidelines for pregnancy and the postpartum period. Gender differences have not been reported for the prevalence of bipolar disorder; however, women are more likely to experience rapid cycling, mixed mania, and antidepressant-induced manias. This may affect response to treatment, which has been found, in some cases, to differ in men and women. In addition, side effects in response to treatments may well differ in men and women, especially with regard to lithium and valproate prescription. The course of bipolar disorder in women may be influenced by the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, the postpartum period, and menopause, although many issues require further clarification. Treatment of bipolar disorder during pregnancy and the postmenopausal period requires careful consideration, as does treatment during the childbearing years, as some mood stabilizers influence the metabolism of oral contraceptives. This review article has attempted to evaluate existing literature regarding women with bipolar disorder in a comprehensive and critical way, and to consolidate into a single source the gender-specific aspects of the disorder that may have treatment implications for women.","Monitor the levels of lithium and anticonvulsants monthly through the second trimester, then weekly during the third trimester because of blood volume changes."
"Prophylactic oxytocin: Before or after placental delivery
Our purpose was to compare the controlled cord traction technique with the minimal intervention technique for delivery of the placenta. The primary outcome was the incidence of postpartum hemorrhage. Secondary outcomes included duration of third stage of labor, frequency of retained placenta, hemorrhagic shock, the need for blood transfusion, and the need for uterotonic agents to control postpartum hemorrhage. A total of 1648 women who were delivered vaginally were randomly allocated during labor to the controlled cord traction group (n = 827) or the minimal intervention group (n = 821). In the controlled cord traction group women received oxytocin, 10 units intramuscularly, with delivery of the baby's anterior shoulder, after which the placenta was delivered actively by controlled cord traction (Brandt-Andrews method). In the minimal intervention group the placenta was delivered by maternal pushing. Continuous intravenous oxytocin was given after delivery of the placenta. Odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals were calculated for each variable. The overall incidence of postpartum hemorrhage was significantly lower in the controlled cord traction group (5.8% vs 11%; odds ratio 0.50, 95% confidence interval 0.34 to 0.73). The incidence of retained placenta (> or = 30 minutes) was 1.6% in the controlled cord traction group and 4.5% in the minimal intervention group (odds ratio 0.31, 95% confidence interval 0.15 to 0.63). Significantly more patients in the minimal intervention group required additional uterotonic agents to control hemorrhage (5.1% vs 2.3%; odds ratio 0.44, 95% confidence interval 0.24 to 0.78). The controlled cord traction technique for delivery of the placenta results in a significantly lower incidence of postpartum hemorrhage and retained placenta, as well as less need for uterotonic agents, compared with the minimal intervention technique.","A randomized controlled trials concluded that oxytocin is more effective in reducing postpartum hemorrhage when given before placental delivery (after delivery of the anterior shoulder and head, respectively). The study was neither blinded nor controlled for nonpharmacologic interventions, however."
"Other than anticoagulation, what is the best therapy for those with atrial fibrillation
There are two approaches to the treatment of atrial fibrillation: one is cardioversion and treatment with antiarrhythmic drugs to maintain sinus rhythm, and the other is the use of rate-controlling drugs, allowing atrial fibrillation to persist. In both approaches, the use of anticoagulant drugs is recommended. We conducted a randomized, multicenter comparison of these two treatment strategies in patients with atrial fibrillation and a high risk of stroke or death. The primary end point was overall mortality. A total of 4060 patients (mean [+/-SD] age, 69.7+/-9.0 years) were enrolled in the study; 70.8 percent had a history of hypertension, and 38.2 percent had coronary artery disease. Of the 3311 patients with echocardiograms, the left atrium was enlarged in 64.7 percent and left ventricular function was depressed in 26.0 percent. There were 356 deaths among the patients assigned to rhythm-control therapy and 310 deaths among those assigned to rate-control therapy (mortality at five years, 23.8 percent and 21.3 percent, respectively; hazard ratio, 1.15 [95 percent confidence interval, 0.99 to 1.34]; P=0.08). More patients in the rhythm-control group than in the rate-control group were hospitalized, and there were more adverse drug effects in the rhythm-control group as well. In both groups, the majority of strokes occurred after warfarin had been stopped or when the international normalized ratio was subtherapeutic. Management of atrial fibrillation with the rhythm-control strategy offers no survival advantage over the rate-control strategy, and there are potential advantages, such as a lower risk of adverse drug effects, with the rate-control strategy. Anticoagulation should be continued in this group of high-risk patients.","The AFFIRM trial, the largest (n=4060), was a nonblinded, randomized, multicenter study with an average follow-up of 3.5 years. The patients were aged 65 years or older and had at least 1 other risk factor for stroke. The rhythm-control group was given an antiarrhythmic medication chosen by the treating physician, while the rate-control group was given either a beta-blocker, a calcium-channel blocker, digoxin, or a combination of these as needed. Heart-rate goals were a resting pulse under 80 beats per minute, and a pulse after a 6-minute walk under 110 beats per minute. An intention-totreat analysis was followed. There was no difference between the 2 groups for the composite endpoints of death, disabling stroke, disabling anoxic encephalopathy, major bleeding, or cardiac arrest. A nonsignificant trend was observed for mortality favoring the rate-control group (relative risk [RR]=1.15; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.99-1.34). Quality-of-life measures were equivalent in the 2 groups at all points in the study."
"What are the indications for meningococcal vaccination
In January 2005, a tetravalent meningococcal polysaccharide-protein conjugate vaccine ([MCV4] Menactra, manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur, Inc., Swiftwater, Pennsylvania) was licensed for use among persons aged 11-55 years. CDCns Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends routine vaccination of young adolescents (defined in this report as persons aged 11-12 years) with MCV4 at the preadolescent health-care visit (at age 11-12 years). Introducing a recommendation for MCV4 vaccination among young adolescents might strengthen the role of the preadolescent visit and have a positive effect on vaccine coverage among adolescents. For those persons who have not previously received MCV4, ACIP recommends vaccination before high-school entry (at approximately age 15 years) as an effective strategy to reduce meningococcal disease incidence among adolescents and young adults. By 2008, the goal will be routine vaccination with MCV4 of all adolescents beginning at age 11 years. Routine vaccination with meningococcal vaccine also is recommended for college freshmen living in dormitories and for other populations at increased risk (i.e., military recruits, travelers to areas in which meningococcal disease is hyperendemic or epidemic, microbiologists who are routinely exposed to isolates of Neisseria meningitidis, patients with anatomic or functional asplenia, and patients with terminal complement deficiency). Other adolescents, college students, and persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus who wish to decrease their risk for meningococcal disease may elect to receive vaccine. This report updates previous reports from ACIP concerning prevention and control of meningococcal disease. It also provides updated recommendations regarding use of the tetravalent meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine (MPSV4) and on antimicrobial chemoprophylaxis.","Using active community surveillance from 1991 to 2002, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data found annual rates of meningococcal disease in the US of 0.5 to 1.1 per 100,000. The highest rates were found in children under age 2. Infants younger than 12 months of age were especially vulnerable (rate 9/100,000), with more than 50% of cases caused by serogroup B."
"What's the best drug treatment for premature ejaculation
To assess the use of a topical anaesthetic mixture to improve premature ejaculation (PE), for which penile hypersensitivity might be a cause. The study included 42 men divided in two groups; group A used a lidocaine-prilocaine solution and group B used an inert cream. The tubes of cream were distributed randomly and participants asked to note any unpleasant symptoms, difficulties and the results of each attempt at intercourse, assessed by the intravaginal ejaculatory latency time (IELT). There was a significant increase in the mean (sd) IELT, from 1.49 (0.9) to 8.45 (0.9) min (P < 0.001) in group A but not in group B, at 1.67 (0.7) to 1.95 (0.12) min (P > 0.05). We suggest that anaesthetic cream might be effective for treating PE.",One double-blinded randomized controlled trials (N=29) showed significant improvement in the IELT (measured by stopwatch by the subject's partner) from baseline compared with placebo (8.45 min vs 1.95 min; P<.001) at 2 months.
"What are the indications for evaluating a patient with cough for pertussis
Reported cases of pertussis among adolescents and adults have increased since the 1980s, despite increasingly high rates of vaccination among infants and children. However, severe pertussis morbidity and mortality occur primarily among infants. To describe the trends and characteristics of reported cases of pertussis among infants younger than 12 months in the United States from 1980 to 1999. Cases of pertussis in infants younger than 12 months in the United States reported to the National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention between 1980 and 1999, and detailed case data from the Supplementary Pertussis Surveillance System. Incidence and demographic and clinical characteristics of cases. The incidence of reported cases of pertussis among infants increased 49% in the 1990s compared with the incidence in the 1980s (19 798 vs 12 550 cases reported; 51.1 cases vs 34.2 cases per 100 000 infant population, respectively). Increases in the incidence of cases and the number of deaths among infants during the 1990s primarily were among those aged 4 months or younger, contrasting with a stable incidence of cases among infants aged 5 months or older. The proportion of cases confirmed by bacterial culture was higher in the 1990s than in the 1980s (50% and 33%, respectively); the proportion of hospitalized cases was unchanged (67% vs 68%, respectively). Receipt of fewer doses of vaccine was associated with hospitalization, when cases were stratified by age in months. The incidence of reported cases of pertussis among infants increased in the 1990s compared with the 1980s. The limited age group affected, the increased rate of bacteriologic confirmation, and the unchanged severity of illness suggest that an increase in infant pertussis has occurred apart from any change in reporting. Strategies are needed to prevent the morbidity and mortality from pertussis among infants too young to be fully vaccinated, according to the current recommended schedules of vaccination in the United States.","Infants aged <6 months with pertussis are at particular risk for atypical presentations and serious complications. In a US series of 18,500 infants with pertussis, apnea was seen in 64% of infants under 1 month and in 44% between 6 and 11 months. Forty percent of the 6- to 11-month-olds had received at least 3 doses of pertussis vaccine."
"What is the best treatment for infants with colic
To evaluate the effectiveness of diets, drug treatment, and behavioural interventions on infantile colic in trials with crying or the presence of colic as the primary outcome measure. Controlled clinical trials identified by a highly sensitive search strategy in Medline (1966-96), Embase (1986-95), and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, in combination with reference checking for further relevant publications. Keywords were crying and colic. Two independent assessors selected controlled trials with interventions lasting at least 3 days that included infants younger than 6 months who cried excessively. Methodological quality was assessed by two assessors independently with a quality assessment scale (range 0-5). Effect sizes were calculated as percentage success. Effect sizes of trials using identical interventions were pooled using a random effects model. 27 controlled trials were identified. Elimination of cows' milk protein was effective when substituted by hypoallergenic formula milks (effect size 0.22 (95% confidence interval 0.09 to 0.34)). The effectiveness of substitution by soy formula milks was unclear when only trials of good methodological quality were considered. The benefit of eliminating cows' milk protein was not restricted to highly selected populations. Dicyclomine was effective (effect size 0.46 (0.33 to 0.60)), but serious side effects have been reported. The advice to reduce stimulation was beneficial (effect size 0.48 (0.23 to 0.74)), whereas the advice to increase carrying and holding seemed not to reduce crying. No benefit was shown for simethicone. Uncertainty remained about the effectiveness of low lactose formula milks. Infantile colic should preferably be treated by advising carers to reduce stimulation and with a one week trial of a hypoallergenic formula milk.","A small randomized controlled trials (43 patients) suggested efficacy in the substitution of a whey hydrolysate formula in place of cow's milkbased formula for infants with colic (casein hydrolysate formula has been more widely studied), but there continues to be controversy regarding the preferred protein hydrolysate formula (whey vs casein) in the treatment of colic."
"Can counseling prevent or treat postpartum depression
The cause of postpartum depression remains unclear, with extensive research suggesting a multi-factorial aetiology. However, epidemiological studies and meta-analyses of predictive studies have consistently demonstrated the importance of psychosocial and psychological variables. While interventions based on these variables may be effective treatment strategies, theoretically they may also be used in pregnancy and the early postpartum period to prevent postpartum depression. Primary: to assess the effect of diverse psychosocial and psychological interventions compared with usual antepartum, intrapartum, or postpartum care to reduce the risk of developing postpartum depression. Secondary: to examine (1) the effectiveness of specific types of psychosocial and psychological interventions, (2) the effectiveness of individual versus group-based interventions, (3) the effects of intervention onset and duration, and (4) whether interventions are more effective in women selected with specific risk factors. We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group trials register (January 27 2004), the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group trials register (October 2003), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (October 2003), MEDLINE (1966 to 2004), EMBASE (1980 to 2004) and CINAHL (1982 to 2004). We scanned secondary references and contacted experts in the field. All published and unpublished randomised controlled trials of acceptable quality comparing a psychosocial or psychological intervention with usual antenatal, intrapartum, or postpartum care. Both reviewers participated in the evaluation of methodological quality and data extraction. Additional information was sought from several trial researchers. Results are presented using relative risk for categorical data and weighted mean difference for continuous data. Fifteen trials, involving over 7600 women, were included. Overall, women who received a psychosocial intervention were equally likely to develop postpartum depression as those receiving standard care (relative risk (RR) 0.81, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.65 to 1.02). One promising intervention appears to be the provision of intensive postpartum support provided by public health nurses or midwives (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.84). Identifying mothers 'at-risk' assisted the prevention of postpartum depression (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.89). Interventions with only a postnatal component appeared to be more beneficial (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.98) than interventions that also incorporated an antenatal component. While individually-based interventions may be more effective (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.00) than those that are group-based, women who received multiple-contact intervention were just as likely to experience postpartum depression as those who received a single-contact intervention. Overall psychosocial interventions do not reduce the numbers of women who develop postpartum depression. However, a promising intervention is the provision of intensive, professionally-based postpartum support.","A Cochrane meta-analysis of pooled data from 15 RCTs (7697 women) found that psychological interventions did not prevent PPD based on comparison of initial depression scores with scores at the conclusion of the studies (relative risk [RR]=0.81; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.65-1.02).1 Although some studies suggested short-term benefit (N=4091; RR=0.65; 95% CI, 0.43-1.00), benefits diminished over time and were not noted when the definition of depression was limited to an Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale (EPDS) score below 12 (out of a maximum of 30). Some differences were found when the data were stratified. Certain interventions were found to prevent depressive symptoms (defined differently in the various studies). They were: home visits provided by healthcare professionals (2 RCTs, N=1663; RR=0.68; 95% CI, 0.55-0.84), interventions targeting at-risk women (7 RCTs, N=1162; RR=0.67; 95% CI, 0.51-0.89), and interventions begun postnatally (10 RCTs, N=6379; RR=0.76; 95% CI, 0.58-0.98). Notably, the level of training of providers of psychological interventions included in the meta-analysis was highly variable."
"What levels of cholesterol should be treated for primary prevention
Although cholesterol-reducing treatment has been shown to reduce fatal and nonfatal coronary disease in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD), it is unknown whether benefit from the reduction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in patients without CHD extends to individuals with average serum cholesterol levels, women, and older persons. To compare lovastatin with placebo for prevention of the first acute major coronary event in men and women without clinically evident atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease with average total cholesterol (TC) and LDL-C levels and below-average high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Outpatient clinics in Texas. A total of 5608 men and 997 women with average TC and LDL-C and below-average HDL-C (as characterized by lipid percentiles for an age- and sex-matched cohort without cardiovascular disease from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey [NHANES] III). Mean (SD) TC level was 5.71 (0.54) mmol/L (221 [21] mg/dL) (51 st percentile), mean (SD) LDL-C level was 3.89 (0.43) mmol/L (150 [17] mg/dL) (60th percentile), mean (SD) HDL-C level was 0.94 (0.14) mmol/L (36 [5] mg/dL) for men and 1.03 (0.14) mmol/L (40 [5] mg/dL) for women (25th and 16th percentiles, respectively), and median (SD) triglyceride levels were 1.78 (0.86) mmol/L (158 [76] mg/dL) (63rd percentile). Lovastatin (20-40 mg daily) or placebo in addition to a low-saturated fat, low-cholesterol diet. First acute major coronary event defined as fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction, unstable angina, or sudden cardiac death. After an average follow-up of 5.2 years, lovastatin reduced the incidence of first acute major coronary events (1 83 vs 116 first events; relative risk [RR], 0.63; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.50-0.79; P<.001), myocardial infarction (95 vs 57 myocardial infarctions; RR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.43-0.83; P=.002), unstable angina (87 vs 60 first unstable angina events; RR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.49-0.95; P=.02), coronary revascularization procedures (157 vs 106 procedures; RR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.52-0.85; P=.001), coronary events (215 vs 163 coronary events; RR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.61-0.92; P =.006), and cardiovascular events (255 vs 194 cardiovascular events; RR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.62-0.91; P = .003). Lovastatin (20-40 mg daily) reduced LDL-C by 25% to 2.96 mmol/L (115 mg/dL) and increased HDL-C by 6% to 1.02 mmol/L (39 mg/dL). There were no clinically relevant differences in safety parameters between treatment groups. Lovastatin reduces the risk for the first acute major coronary event in men and women with average TC and LDL-C levels and below-average HDL-C levels. These findings support the inclusion of HDL-C in risk-factor assessment, confirm the benefit of LDL-C reduction to a target goal, and suggest the need for reassessment of the National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines regarding pharmacological intervention.","Lovastatin reduced the risk of a first major acute coronary event (NNT = 24) in the 5-year AFCAPS/TexCAPS trial that enrolled 5608 men and 997 women with below-average high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) (men, 36 mg/dL; women, 40 mg/dL) without signs or symptoms of CHD. LDL-C was lowered 25% (from a mean of 156 to 115 mg/dL). Unpublished results suggest that simvastatin may have a similar effect. Primary prevention data are still lacking for atorvastatin and fluvastatin."
"Which postmenopausal women should be offered combined hormone replacement therapy
Although postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is widely used in the United States, new evidence about its benefits and harms requires reconsideration of its use for the primary prevention of chronic conditions. To assess the benefits and harms of HRT for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease, thromboembolism, osteoporosis, cancer, dementia, and cholecystitis by reviewing the literature, conducting meta-analyses, and calculating outcome rates. All relevant English-language studies were identified in MEDLINE (1966-2001), HealthSTAR (1975-2001), Cochrane Library databases, and reference lists of key articles. Recent results of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) and the Heart and Estrogen/progestin Replacement Study (HERS) are included for reported outcomes. We used all published studies of HRT if they contained a comparison group of HRT nonusers and reported data relating to HRT use and clinical outcomes of interest. Studies were excluded if the population was selected according to prior events or presence of conditions associated with higher risks for targeted outcomes. Meta-analyses of observational studies indicated summary relative risks (RRs) for coronary heart disease (CHD) incidence and mortality that were significantly reduced among current HRT users only, although risk for incidence was not reduced when only studies that controlled for socioeconomic status were included. The WHI reported increased CHD events (hazard ratio [HR], 1.29; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-1.63). Stroke incidence but not mortality was significantly increased among HRT users in the meta-analysis and the WHI. The meta-analysis indicated that risk was significantly elevated for thromboembolic stroke (RR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.01-1.40) but not subarachnoid or intracerebral stroke. Risk of venous thromboembolism among current HRT users was increased overall (RR, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.64-2.81) and was highest during the first year of use (RR, 3.49; 95% CI, 2.33-5.59) according to a meta-analysis of 12 studies. Protection against osteoporotic fractures is supported by a meta-analysis of 22 estrogen trials, cohort studies, results of the WHI, and trials with bone density outcomes. Current estrogen users have an increased risk of breast cancer that increases with duration of use. Endometrial cancer incidence, but not mortality, is increased with unopposed estrogen use but not with estrogen with progestin. A meta-analysis of 18 observational studies showed a 20% reduction in colon cancer incidence among women who had ever used HRT (RR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.74-0.86), a finding supported by the WHI. Women symptomatic from menopause had improvement in certain aspects of cognition. Current studies of estrogen and dementia are not definitive. In a cohort study, current HRT users had an age-adjusted RR for cholecystitis of 1.8 (95% CI, 1.6-2.0), increasing to 2.5 (95% CI, 2.0-2.9) after 5 years of use. Benefits of HRT include prevention of osteoporotic fractures and colorectal cancer, while prevention of dementia is uncertain. Harms include CHD, stroke, thromboembolic events, breast cancer with 5 or more years of use, and cholecystitis.",The findings of the women's health initiative and HERS trials have been summarized in a recent meta-analysis done for the United States Preventive Services Task Force.
"What is the best management for patients who have a TIA while on aspirin therapy
We examined the baseline characteristics of patients in the Ticlopidine Aspirin Stroke Study (TASS) to determine if the effects of the two treatments in preventing stroke differed in various subgroups. Patients with the following characteristics did less well on aspirin: elevated creatinine, hypertension or diabetes requiring treatment, or treatment with anticoagulant or antiplatelet drugs prior to their qualifying TIA or stroke. Women and patients with vertebrobasilar symptoms did particularly well on ticlopidine. We performed arteriography in 1,188 patients with carotid qualifying events. The frequency of stroke in patients with abnormal arteriograms ipsilateral to their symptoms was slightly higher than in those with normal carotid arteries. Ticlopidine was more effective in patients without carotid stenosis. Ticlopidine is more effective than aspirin in preventing strokes in patients having warning TIAs. The patients who benefit most from ticlopidine may be women, those who have vertebrobasilar symptoms, those with cerebral ischemic symptoms while on aspirin or anticoagulant therapy, and patients with diffuse atherosclerotic disease rather than high-grade carotid stenosis.",Subgroup analysis indicated that ticlopidine provided superior benefit for patients on aspirin or anticoagulant therapy at the time of their qualifying event.
"How should thyroid replacement be initiated
Some hypothyroid patients receiving levothyroxine replacement therapy complain of depressive symptoms despite normal TSH measurements. It is not known whether adding T(3) can reverse such symptoms. We randomized 40 individuals with depressive symptoms who were taking a stable dose of levothyroxine for treatment of hypothyroidism (excluding those who underwent thyroidectomy or radioactive iodine ablation of the thyroid) to receive T(4) plus placebo or the combination of T(4) plus T(3) in a double-blind manner for 15 wk. Participants receiving combination therapy had their prestudy dose of T(4) dropped by 50%, and T(3) was started at a dose of 12.5 micro g, twice daily. T(4) and T(3) doses were adjusted to keep goal TSH concentrations within the normal range. Compared with the group taking T(4) alone, the group taking both T(4) plus T(3) did not report any improvement in self-rated mood and well-being scores that included all subscales of the Symptom Check-List-90, the Comprehensive Epidemiological Screen for Depression, and the Multiple Outcome Study (P > 0.05 for all indexes). In conclusion, the current data do not support the routine use of combined T(3) and T(4) therapy in hypothyroid patients with depressive symptoms.","One study, which enrolled patients with hypothy-roidism and mild depressive symptoms, assessed scores on the Symptom Check-List-90, the Comprehensive Epidemiological Screens for Depression, and the Medical Outcomes Study health status questionnaire at baseline and multiple times over the duration of the study. For these outcomes, no differences were found between the LT4 alone and combination LT4-LT3 treatment groups within 90% confidence intervals."
"What is the best treatment for Osgood-Schlatter disease
This report reflects the evolution of the operative treatment of Osgood-Schlatter's disease as practiced in Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children. In the earlier portion of the series patients were treated by drilling of the tibial tubercle with or without removal of the prominence (Group A--22 operations). In the latter portion of the series loose pieces of cartilage or bone were excised without removal of the prominent tubercle or drilling (Group B--22 operations). The results showed a much higher incidence of excellent or good results in Group B. These patients had a short simple operation followed by rapid mobilization and return to full activity. We would, therefore, recommend this procedure for those who have significant symptoms from osteochondritis of the tibial tubercle.",A case series compared 22 patients who1 underwent drilling of the tibial tubercle (with or without the removal of the tibial tubercle) with 22 patients who had excision of loose ossicles or cartilage. Seventeen of the 22 (77%) patients with ossicle excision had complete resolution of symptoms compared with 8 of the 22 (36%) in the patients who underwent tibial tubercle drilling.
"Which strategies work best to prevent obesity in adults
Preventing weight gain in adults and excessive weight gain in children is a high priority. We evaluated the ability of a family-based program aimed at increasing steps and cereal consumption (for breakfast and snacks) to reduce weight gain in children and adults. Families (n = 105) with at least one 8- to 12-year-old child who was at-risk-for-overweight or overweight (designated as the target child) were recruited for the study. Eighty-two families were randomly assigned to receive the family-based intervention and 23 families to the control condition. The 13-week intervention consisted of specific increases in daily steps (an additional 2000 steps/d) and consumption of 2 servings/d of ready-to-eat cereal. The intervention was successful in increasing walking (steps) and cereal consumption. The intervention had positive, significant effects on percentage BMI-for-age and percentage body fat for target children and weight, BMI, and percentage body fat for parents. On further analysis, the positive effects of the intervention were seen largely in target girls and moms, rather than in target boys and dads. This family-based weight gain prevention program based on small changes holds promise for reducing excessive weight gain in families and especially in growing overweight children.","A family-based trial of weight gain prevention randomized 82 families to a group that was encouraged to eat 2 servings of cereal a day and increase activity by 2000 steps a day, or to a control group. In the intervention group, body mass index (BMI) decreased by 0.4% in mothers (P=.027), and body mass index percentage for age decreased by 2.6% in daughters (P<.01). Male family members showed no significant differences, however."
"Which interventions are best for alleviating nipple pain in nursing mothers
To review the literature on nipple pain and to delineate effective strategies for the prevention and treatment of nipple pain in breastfeeding mothers. Computerized searches on MEDLINE, Pre-MEDLINE, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library. Articles from indexed journals relevant to the objective were reviewed from January 1983 to April 2004. Preference was given to research-based studies in English. Data were extracted and organized under two headings: prevention of nipple pain or trauma and treatment of nipple pain or trauma. The Critical Appraisal Form by J. Briggs was used to extract the data from research-based articles. The health benefits of breastfeeding for mother and infant are well documented; however, nipple pain is a common reason reported by women for the early termination of breastfeeding. Several studies have compared various treatments for either the prevention of or treatment for nipple pain. These treatments include warm water compresses, tea bag compresses, heat, application of expressed mother's milk, lanolin, vitamin A, collagenase, dexpanthenol, hydrogel therapy, glycerin gel therapy, moist occlusive dressing, education regarding proper latch-on and positioning, and no treatment. No one topical agent showed superior results in the relief of nipple discomfort. The most important factor in decreasing the incidence of nipple pain is the provision of education in relation to proper breastfeeding technique and latch-on as well as anticipatory guidance regarding the high incidence of early postpartum nipple pain.",Nipple pain during the first week of breastfeeding is common. Some studies report a prevalence as high as 96%.
"How much can exercise raise creatine kinase level-and does it matter
A comparison was made between pre- and post-run serum levels of total creatine kinase (CK), CK-MB isoenzyme, lactate dehydrogenase (LD) and myoglobin (MG) levels in 84 runners in each of three groups; male 5-10 mile run; female 5-10 mile run; and male 15-55 mile run. Levels of CK-MB and MG were quantified using radioimmunoassay, while total CK and LD were measured using spectrophotometric procedures. Post-run levels of all four markers were significantly higher than the pre-run levels (p less than 0.001). Although levels of enzymes and MG correlated with the sex and distance run, the post-run changes did not correlate with age nor with the smoking status of the runners. Elevation of these markers as a result of vigorous exercise in the absence of myocardial infarction requires cautious interpretation of serum enzyme changes in runners.",A study showed that triathletes had a 12-fold mean increase in creatine kinase levels as long as 24 hours after the race.
"Should we screen for bacterial vaginosis in those at risk for preterm labor
Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a strong independent risk factor for adverse pregnancy outcomes. BV is found in 9% to 23% of pregnant women. Symptoms include vaginal discharge, pruritus, or malodor, but often women with BV are asymptomatic. To determine whether screening and treating pregnant women for BV reduces adverse pregnancy outcomes, as part of an assessment for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. Randomized clinical trials of BV treatment in pregnancy that measured pregnancy outcomes were identified from multiple searches in MEDLINE from 1966 to 1999, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register and Library, and national experts. All randomized controlled trials of BV treatment in pregnancy that specifically measured pregnancy outcomes. The following information was abstracted: study design and blinding, diagnostic methods, antibiotic interventions, timing of antibiotic treatment in pregnancy, criteria for treatment, comorbidities, demographic details, risk factors for preterm delivery such as previous preterm delivery, compliance, rates of spontaneous and total preterm delivery less than 37 weeks and less than 34 weeks, preterm premature rupture of membranes, low birth weight less than 2500 grams, spontaneous abortion, postpartum endometritis, and neonatal sepsis. For each study, we measured the effect of treatment by calculating the difference in the rate of a given pregnancy outcome in the control group minus the treatment group (the absolute risk reduction [ARR]). A stepwise procedure based on the profile likelihood was applied to assess heterogeneity, to pool studies when appropriate, and to calculate the mean and 90% confidence intervals (CIs) for the effect of treatment. Seven randomized controlled trials met inclusion criteria for the meta-analysis. We found no benefit to BV treatment in average-risk women for any pregnancy outcome. Results of studies of high-risk populations, women with previous preterm delivery, were statistically heterogeneous. They clustered into two groups; one showed no benefit (ARR=-0.08, 90% CI=-0.19 to 0.04), whereas the three homogeneous studies showed potential benefit of BV treatment (pooled ARR=0.22; 90% CI=0.13 to 0.31) for preterm delivery before 37 weeks. Four high-risk studies reported results for preterm delivery less than 34 weeks. The pooled estimate showed no benefit (ARR=0.04; 90% CI=-0.02 to 0.09), but variation was noted among individual studies. Two trials of high-risk women found an increase in preterm delivery less than 34 weeks in women who did not have BV but received BV treatment. Comparisons of patient populations, treatment regimens, and study designs did not explain the heterogeneity among studies. We found no benefit to routine BV screening and treatment. A subgroup of high-risk women may benefit from BV screening and treatment; however, there may be a subgroup for whom BV treatment could increase the occurrence of preterm delivery.","A meta-analysis of 7 RCTs reviewed the evidence of screening for bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy. In this meta-analysis, 5 of the trials specified that women were asymptomatic, and the other 2 did not comment on whether the women were symptomatic or not. In general, there was no benefit to routine screening and treatment of BV. However, a subgroup of high-risk women seems to benefit from screening and treatment. They defined high-risk women as those have had a preterm delivery, premature rupture of membranes, birth weight <2500 g, or spontaneous abortion. Treating bacterial vaginosis in women with a high-risk pregnancy decreased preterm delivery (absolute risk reduction [ARR]=0.22; 90% confidence interval [CI], 0.13-0.31; number needed to treat [NNT]=4.5) regardless of antibiotic choice. However, 2 trials of high-risk women who were empirically treated for BV, but did not have BV, showed an increase in preterm delivery less than 34 weeks (number needed to harm [NNH]=11)."
"Does reducing smoking in the home protect children from the effects of second-hand smoke
To examine parents' reported knowledge and use of harm reduction strategies to protect their infants from exposure to tobacco smoke in the home, and the relation between reported use of strategies and urinary cotinine to creatinine ratios in the infants. Cross sectional survey. Coventry and Birmingham. Parents' reported knowledge and use of harm reduction strategies and urinary cotinine to creatinine ratios in their infants. 314 smoking households with infants. 86% of parents (264/307) believed that environmental tobacco smoke is harmful, 90% (281/314) believed that infants can be protected from it in the home, and 10% (32/314) were either unaware of measures or reported using none. 65% of parents (205/314) reported using two or more measures, but only 18% (58/314) reported not allowing smoking in the home. No difference was found in mean log e transformed urinary cotinine to creatinine ratio in infants from households that used no measures compared with households that used less strict measures. Mean log cotinine to creatinine ratios were significantly different in households banning smoking in the home compared with those using less strict or no measures. Banning smoking in the home was independently associated with a significant reduction in urinary cotinine to creatinine ratio by a factor of 2.6 (1.6 to 4.2) after adjustment for average household cigarette consumption, tenure, and overcrowding. Less than a fifth of parents in smoking households ban smoking in the home. Banning smoking was associated with a small but significant reduction in urinary cotinine to creatinine ratio in infants, whereas less strict measures compared with no measures had no effect on the infants' exposure to environmental tobacco smoke.","A 2003 cross-sectional survey of 164 households in the United Kingdom with at least 1 smoking parent and 1 bottle-fed infant looked for a correlation between strategies to reduce second-hand smoke and urine cotinine-to-creatinine ratios in the infants. Parents were classified into 3 groups according to whether they maintained a strict ban on smoking in the home, a less strict ban (smoking at home but not near the infant), or no ban. The mean infant urinary cotinine-to-creatinine ratio was 2.43 in the no-ban group and 2.61 in the less-strict ban group (difference not significant). The combined mean for these 2 groups-2.58-was significantly higher than the mean of 1.26 in the strictest group (P<.001)."
"What is appropriate management of iron deficiency for young children
Iron-deficient anaemic infants perform worse in tests of mental and motor development than do iron-sufficient infants of a comparable age. A randomised, double-blind trial was done to monitor the effects of iron supplementation on performance in the Bayley scales of mental and motor development among 12-18-month-old infants in Indonesia. Iron-deficient anaemic infants (n = 50) were assigned randomly to receive dietary ferrous sulphate or placebo for 4 month. Similar treatment randomisation was done among nonanaemic iron-deficient (n = 29) and iron-sufficient (n = 47) infants. Before intervention, the mean mental and motor scores of the iron-deficient anaemic infants were significantly (p < 0.01) lower than those of the nonanaemic iron-deficient and iron-sufficient classes. After intervention, developmental delays were reversed among iron-deficient anaemic infants who had received iron but they remained the same among placebo-treated iron-deficient anaemic infants. Neither ferrous sulphate nor placebo had significant effects on the scores of the other two iron-status classes. The poor performance of 12-18-month-old iron-deficient anaemic infants in the Bayley scales of mental and motor development can be improved to the level of performance of iron-sufficient infants by treatment with ferrous sulphate.","In an Indonesian randomized controlled trial (RCT), baseline Bayley scores were 10% to 15% lower (P<.01) for infants (12-18 months) with iron deficiency anemia compared with both nonanemic iron-deficient and iron-sufficient infants. Following treatment with ferrous sulfate (3 mg/kg/d of elemental iron) for 4 months, the iron deficiency anemia infants' Bayley scores improved compared with those of nonanemic children."
"Are there any known health risks to early introduction of solids to an infant's diet
The optimal time and choice of solid foods to introduce to an infant's diet is unknown. The aim of this randomized trial was to determine whether early versus late introduction of solid foods and commercially prepared versus parent's choice of solid foods affects growth or body composition in the first year. White infants (n = 165) were recruited before 3 months of age and were randomized to receive: 1) commercially prepared solid foods (commercial) from 3 to 12 months, 2) commercially prepared solid foods from 6 to 12 months, 3) parent's choice of solid foods (choice) from 3 to 12 months, or 4) parent's choice of solid foods from 6 to 12 months. Anthropometrics and body composition, using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry, were determined at 3, 6, and 12 months. Three-day diet diaries were completed at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. There were no differences in growth or body composition between infants in early versus late introduction groups or commercial versus choice groups at any age. The total energy intake was not different among infants in the early compared with the late group at any age. Infants in the commercial group consumed less protein calories at 9 months (80 +/- 3 kcal/d vs 88 +/- 3 kcal/d) and 12 months 101 +/- 5 kcal/d vs 148 +/- 5 kcal/d), less fat calories at 12 months (263 +/- 10 kcal/d vs 343 +/- 10 kcal/d), and less total calories at 12 months (884 +/- 24 kcal/d vs 1022 +/- 25 kcal/d) compared with the choice group. The early introduction of solid foods to an infant's diet does not alter growth or body composition during the first year of life and results in a displacement of energy intake from formula. Infants consuming commercially prepared foods have a decreased caloric intake from protein and fat; however, despite this difference, there is no effect on growth or body composition.","A randomized, prospective trial (N=165) compared early and late introduction of solids with fat mass at 3, 6, and 12 months of age. No significant difference in adiposity between treatment groups was noted at any end point."
"Menstrual disturbances in perimenopausal women: What's best
The decline in circulating oestrogen around the time of the menopause often induces unacceptable symptoms that affect the health and well being of women. Hormone replacement therapy (both unopposed oestrogen and oestrogen and progestogen combinations) is an effective treatment for these symptoms. In women with an intact uterus, unopposed oestrogen may induce endometrial stimulation and increase the risk of endometrial hyperplasia and carcinoma. The addition of progestogen reduces this risk but may cause unacceptable symptoms, bleeding and spotting which can affect adherence to therapy. The objective of this review is to assess which hormone replacement therapy regimens provide effective protection against the development of endometrial hyperplasia and/or carcinoma with a low rate of abnormal vaginal bleeding. We searched the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group trials register (searched January 2003), The Cochrane Library (Issue 2, 2003), MEDLINE (1966 to January 2003), EMBASE (1980 to January 2003), Current Contents (1993 to January 2003), Biological Abstracts (1969 to 2002), Social Sciences Index (1980 to January 2003), PsycINFO (1972 to February 2003) and CINAHL (1982 to January 2003). The search strategy was developed by the Cochrane Menstrual Disorder and Subfertility Group. Attempts were also made to identify trials from citation lists of review articles and drug companies were contacted for unpublished data. In most cases, the corresponding author of each included trial was contacted for additional information. The inclusion criteria were randomised comparisons of unopposed oestrogen therapy, combined continuous oestrogen-progestogen therapy and sequential oestrogen-progestogen therapy with each other and placebo administered over a minimum treatment period of six months. Trials had to assess which regimen was the most protective against the development of endometrial hyperplasia/carcinoma and/or caused the lowest rate of irregular bleeding. Sixty RCTs were identified. Of these 23 were excluded and seven remain awaiting assessment. The reviewers assessed the thirty included studies for quality, extracted the data independently and odds ratios for dichotomous outcomes were estimated. Outcomes analysed included frequency of endometrial hyperplasia or carcinoma, frequency of irregular bleeding and unscheduled biopsies or dilation and curettage, and adherence to therapy. Unopposed moderate or high dose oestrogen therapy when compared to placebo was associated with a significant increase in rates of endometrial hyperplasia with increasing rates at longer duration of treatment and follow up. Odds ratios ranged from (1 RCT; OR 5.4, 95% CI 1.4 to 20.9) for 6 months of treatment to (4 RCTs; OR 9.6, 95% CI 5.9 to 15.5) for 24 months treatment and (1 RCT; OR 15.0, 95% CI 9.3 to 27.5) for 36 months of treatment with moderate dose oestrogen (in the PEPI trial, 62% of those who took moderate dose oestrogen had some form of hyperplasia at 36 months compared to 2% of those who took placebo). Irregular bleeding and non adherence to treatment were also significantly more likely under these unopposed oestrogen regimens that increased bleeding with higher dose therapy. Although not statistically significant, there was a 3% incidence (2 RCTs) of hyperplasia in women who took low dose oestrogen compared to no incidence of hyperplasia in the placebo group. The addition of progestogens, either in continuous combined or sequential regimens, helped to reduce the risk of endometrial hyperplasia and improved adherence to therapy. At longer duration of treatment, continuous therapy was more effective than sequential therapy in reducing the risk of endometrial hyperplasia. There was evidence of a higher incidence of hyperplasia under long cycle sequential therapy (progestogen given every three months) compared to monthly sequential therapy (progestogen given every month). No increase in endometrial cancer was seen in any of t in any of the treatment groups during the duration (maximum of six years) of these trials. During the first year of therapy irregular bleeding and spotting was more likely in continuous combined therapy than sequential therapy. However, during the second year of therapy bleeding and spotting was more likely under sequential regimens. There is strong and consistent evidence in this review that unopposed oestrogen therapy, at moderate and high doses, is associated with increased rates of endometrial hyperplasia, irregular bleeding and consequent non adherence to therapy. The addition of oral progestogens administered either sequentially or continuously is associated with reduced rates of hyperplasia and improved adherence to therapy. Irregular bleeding is less likely under sequential than continuous therapy during the first year of therapy but there is a suggestion that continuous therapy over long duration is more protective than sequential therapy in the prevention of endometrial hyperplasia. Hyperplasia is more likely when progestogen is given every three months in a sequential regimen compared to a monthly progestogen sequential regimen.","A more recent Cochrane review of 30 RCTs examined hormone replacement therapy for irregular bleeding and endometrial hyperplasia in postmenopausal women who had been amenorrheic for at least 6 months (a more liberal criterion for inclusion). The review concluded that many of the women treated with continuous estrogen and progestin became amenorrheic after 1 year of therapy. It also reiterated that unopposed estrogen increased the risk of endometrial hyperplasia, whereas continuous combined estrogen and progestogen treatment didn't."
"How effective is gastric bypass for weight loss
A clinical study was undertaken to assess gynecologic-obstetric changes in morbidly obese women who lost greater than or equal to 50% of their excess weight with bariatric surgery. The 138 females (109 of reproductive age), age 35 +/- 9 SD yr, weighed 124 +/- 23 kg before surgery and 79 +/- 13 kg after weight loss had stabilized. Menstrual irregularities were present in 40.4% of premenopausal patients preoperatively; after massive weight loss, cycles were abnormal in 4.6% (p less than 0.001). Infertility problems were present preoperatively in 29.3% Of these, nine tried to conceive after weight loss and were successful. During past pregnancies, medical complications were frequent (hypertension 26.7%, pre-eclampsia 12.8%, diabetes 7.0%, and deep vein thrombosis 7.0%). After weight-loss stabilization, these obstetric complications did not occur. Incidence of urinary stress incontinence decreased from 61.2% to 11.6% (p less than 0.001). Gynecologic-obstetric changes tended to normalize after loss of massive body weight.","In a case series, menstrual irregularities decreased from 40.4% to 4.6% following surgery (P<.001) among women who lost 50% of their excess weight. The incidence of urinary stress incontinence also decreased significantly (61.2% to 11.6%, P<.001 in this study)."
"What treatments are effective for varicose veins
A randomised controlled trial was carried out to compare the clinical outcome 5 years after inpatient surgery and outpatient injection/compression sclerotherapy. 91.3% of those originally treated by injection/compression sclerotherapy and 93.9% of those originally treated surgically were seen at follow-up. 40% of patients treated initially by injection/compression sclerotherapy and 24.2% of those treated surgically were given further treatment. The probability of having no further treatment is significantly greater for those treated surgically. The improved outcome after surgery increased with age, being most striking in those aged over 45. The implications of the 5-year follow-up findings for the long-term cost of treatment are discussed.",Beresford and colleagues also concluded that surgery lessened the likelihood of additional treatment.
"What is the prognosis for acute low back pain
To describe the natural course of recent acute low back pain in terms of both morbidity (pain, disability) and absenteeism from work and to evaluate the prognostic factors for these outcomes. Inception cohort study. Primary care. 103 patients with acute localised non-specific back pain lasting less than 72 hours. Complete recovery (disappearance of both pain and disability) and return to work. 90% of patients recovered within two weeks and only two developed chronic low back pain. Only 49 of 100 patients for whom data were available had bed rest and 40% of 75 employed patients lost no time from work. Proportional hazards regression analysis showed that previous chronic episodes of low back pain, initial disability level, initial pain worse when standing, initial pain worse when lying, and compensation status were significantly associated with delayed episode recovery. These factors were also related to absenteeism from work. Absenteeism from work was also influenced by job satisfaction and gender. The recovery rate from acute low back pain was much higher than reported in other studies. Those studies, however, did not investigate groups of patients enrolled shortly after the onset of symptoms and often mixed acute low back pain patients with patients with exacerbations of chronic pain or sciatica. Several sociodemographic and clinical factors were of prognostic value in acute low back pain. Factors which influenced the outcome in terms of episode recovery (mainly physical severity factors) were only partly predictive of absenteeism from work. Time off work and return to work depended more on sociodemographic and job related influences.",One prospective series in a primary care setting found that 90% of patients were without pain 2 weeks after initial evaluation by their physician. This study had a 3-month follow-up period for 103 patients presenting with pain of less than 72 hours' duration.
"What are appropriate screening tests for infants and children
In November 2003, CDC and the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation cosponsored a workshop to review the benefits and risks associated with newborn screening for cystic fibrosis (CF). This report describes new research findings and outlines the recommendations of the workshop. The peer-reviewed evidence presented at the workshop supports the clinical utility of newborn screening for CF. Demonstrated long-term benefits from early nutritional treatment as a result of newborn screening for CF include improved growth and, in one study, cognitive development. Other benefits might include reduced hospitalizations and improved survival. Mixed evidence has been reported for pulmonary outcomes. Newborn screening in the United States is associated with diagnosis of CF a median of 1 year earlier than symptomatic detection, which might reduce the expense and anxiety associated with workup for failure to thrive or other symptoms. Certain psychosocial risks for carrier children and their families (e.g., anxiety and misunderstanding) are associated with newborn screening. Exposure of young children to infectious agents through person-to-person transmission in clinical settings, although not an inherent risk of newborn screening, is a potential cause of harm from early detection. Involving specialists in CF care and infection control, genetic counseling, and communication can minimize these potential harms. Although screening decisions depend on a state's individual resources and priorities, on the basis of evidence of moderate benefits and low risk of harm, CDC believes that newborn screening for CF is justified. States should consider the magnitude of benefits and costs and the need to minimize risks through careful planning and implementation, including ongoing collection and evaluation of outcome data.","A report, based on a systematic review, recommends cystic fibrosis screening in neonates based on moderate benefits and low risks of harm."
"Which technique for removing nevi is least scarring
Patients frequently request removal of benign papular naevi for cosmetic or functional reasons. Shave excision plus electrocautery is probably the most widely used method of removal, but this method is said to result in retained hair or pigment if deeply pigmented or hairy naevi are treated. In a prospective study, 82 benign papular naevi of all types were treated by shave excision using hot-wire electrocautery for haemostasis. Details of the naevi were accurately recorded before treatment and reassessment of shave sites carried out at 6-8 months. At review, a scar was visible at only 63% (52/82) of shave sites and all of these were cosmetically acceptable. Only 27% (15/55) of the initially pigmented naevi retained pigment and only 24% (5/21) of the initially hairy naevi regrew hair. Shave excision and electrocautery of benign naevi, including hairy and deeply pigmented ones, produce excellent cosmetic results. The patient must be warned that there is a potential risk of a scar or pigment remaining after shave excision of any naevus and for hair regrowth after shave excision of hairy naevi.","One prospective study followed 55 patients after removal of nevi from the head and neck. These nevi were removed using a shave procedure with a#15 scalpel and hot cautery for bleeding. Of the 55 sites, 4 retained pigment and 30 had a visible scar with a mean diameter of 5 mm at 6- to 8-month follow-up. The mean diameter of the original lesions was 6 mm. There was no difference between the size of those lesions that scarred and those that didn't."
"What is appropriate management of iron deficiency for young children
Adherence to treatment of iron-deficiency anemia often is poor in both developed and developing countries. The current standard therapy is ferrous sulfate drops (or syrup) administered 3 times daily. It is possible that adherence would improve with a single-dose daily treatment regimen. We compared the use of single versus 3-times-daily ferrous sulfate drops, at the same total iron dose, on treatment of anemia in infants. To obtain a large enough cohort of anemic subjects, we performed the study in rural Ghana. Using a prospective, randomized, controlled design, we studied 557 anemic children (age range: 6-24 months; hemoglobin values: 70-99 g/L). One group (n = 280) received ferrous sulfate drops once daily (40 mg elemental iron), and the control group (n = 277) received ferrous sulfate drops 3 times per day (total dose, 40 mg elemental iron). Treatment lasted for 2 months. Hemoglobin and serum ferritin values were measured at baseline and at the end of the study. Successful treatment of anemia (hemoglobin >100 g/L) occurred in 61% of the single-dose and in 56% of the 3-times-daily group. Geometric mean ferritin levels increased significantly in each group from baseline to the final visit. Side effects were minimal and similar between the 2 groups. A single versus a 3-times-daily dose of ferrous sulfate drops over 2 months resulted in a similar rate of successful treatment of anemia, without side effects. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of the use of a single-dose daily regimen to treat anemia. Although not examined in the current study, use of a single-dose daily regimen may improve adherence to treatment of anemia in infants.",An randomized controlled trials of 557 anemic children under 24 months of age in Ghana demonstrated that ferrous sulfate (5 mg/kg/d) given once daily was equivalent to 3-times-daily dosing in terms of effectiveness (61% vs 56%) and tolerance. Less frequent dosing has been studied in developing countries with mixed results.
"What is the recommended evaluation and treatment for elevated serum prolactin
To assess the effectiveness of bromocriptine in reducing the size of PRL-secreting macroadenomas with extrasellar extension, we conducted a prospective multicenter trial in patients without prior radiotherapy, applying a standard protocol of treatment and tumor size evaluation. Basal serum PRL levels [1441 +/- 417 (+/- SEM) ng/ml for women; 3451 +/- 1111 ng/ml for men] fell in all patients and to 11% or less of basal values in all patients but 1. Normal PRL levels were reached in 18 of the 27 patients. In 13 patients (46%), tumor size was reduced by greater than 50%, in 5 patients (18%) by about 50%, and in 9 patients (36%) by approximately 10-25%. The extent of tumor size reduction did not correlate with basal PRL, nadir PRL, percent fall in PRL, or whether PRL levels reached normal. However, a reduction in PRL levels always preceded any detectable change in tumor size. In 19 patients, reduction in tumor size was evident by 6 weeks, but in the other 8, such reduction was not noted until the 6 month evaluation. In the 4 patients in whom bromocriptine was discontinued at the end of 1 yr, tumor reexpansion occurred in 3. Visual fields improved in 9 of the 10 patients in whom they were abnormal. Because of the excellent results found in most of the patients in this series, we suggest that therapy with bromocriptine should be considered as initial management for patients with PRL-secreting macroadenomas.",A cohort study of 27 patients with macroadenomas treated with bromocriptine found 10% to 50% reductions of tumor size.
"What is the best approach to the evaluation and treatment of chronic cough
Chronic cough is a common problem in patients who visit family physicians. The three most common causes of chronic cough in those who are referred to pulmonary specialists are postnasal drip, asthma and gastroesophageal reflux. The initial treatment of patients with cough is often empiric and may involve a trial of decongestants, bronchodilators or histamine H2 antagonists, as monotherapy or in combination. If a therapeutic trial is not successful, sequential diagnostic testing including chest radiograph, purified protein derivative test for tuberculosis, computed tomography of the sinuses, methacholine challenge test or barium swallow may be indicated. By using a standard protocol for diagnosis and treatment, 90 percent of patients with chronic cough can be managed successfully in the family physician's office. However, in some cases it may take three to five months to determine a diagnosis and effective treatment. For the minority of patients in whom this diagnostic approach is unsuccessful, consultation with a pulmonary specialist is appropriate.","The protocol evaluates for these 3 conditions. The key weakness of the protocol is that a positive diagnostic test result does not mean that treatment for that condition will relieve the cough.5 Recently, empiric treatment before diagnostic testing has been recommended for primary care."
"What is the best hypnotic for use in the elderly
The efficacy and safety of zolpidem, a hypnotic of a new chemical class (the imidazopyridines), was compared with a reference benzodiazepine in elderly insomniac patients in a randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial. Hospitalized patients aged 58 to 98 years were randomized to receive zolpidem 5 mg (70 patients), zolpidem 10 mg (74 patients), or triazolam 0.25 mg (77 patients) at bed-time. (Three patients were excluded and 13 patients did not complete the study.) The 3-week active treatment period was preceded by 3 and followed by 7 days of placebo administration. Sleep quality was assessed by the patient via a questionnaire and visual analog scale. A clinician's global impression was also recorded. All measures of sleep quality were improved by both doses of zolpidem and by triazolam. The improvements between the end of the placebo phase and the end of the active treatment phase were significant for all treatments and assessment instruments. Moreover, the significant improvements in all measures were maintained during the week following withdrawal of both doses of zolpidem. The improvement in most sleep assessment parameters was maintained after withdrawal of triazolam. Tolerability of all treatments was excellent. The majority of patients reported no adverse effects. The reported adverse effects in all groups included nightmares, daytime drowsiness, and day- or nighttime agitation. There was no evidence of rebound insomnia; the therapeutic effect of zolpidem outlasted drug treatment. There were no signs of agitation or anxiety following cessation of treatment, which might be indicative of withdrawal phenomena. Confusion was recorded only in the triazolam group. These results suggest that zolpidem is at least as effective as triazolam in geriatric insomniac patients. Zolpidem 5 mg and 10 mg demonstrated a good safety profile. On the basis of these data, zolpidem 5 mg should be given as a starting dose in elderly patients, with a possible increase up to 10 mg in more severe cases of insomnia.",Comparative studies in the elderly have demonstrated that zolpidem is as effective as triazolam.
"Do statins delay onset or slow progression of Alzheimer's dementia
Although statins reduce coronary and cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality in middle-aged individuals, their efficacy and safety in elderly people is not fully established. Our aim was to test the benefits of pravastatin treatment in an elderly cohort of men and women with, or at high risk of developing, cardiovascular disease and stroke. We did a randomised controlled trial in which we assigned 5804 men (n=2804) and women (n=3000) aged 70-82 years with a history of, or risk factors for, vascular disease to pravastatin (40 mg per day; n=2891) or placebo (n=2913). Baseline cholesterol concentrations ranged from 4.0 mmol/L to 9.0 mmol/L. Follow-up was 3.2 years on average and our primary endpoint was a composite of coronary death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and fatal or non-fatal stroke. Analysis was by intention-to-treat. Pravastatin lowered LDL cholesterol concentrations by 34% and reduced the incidence of the primary endpoint to 408 events compared with 473 on placebo (hazard ratio 0.85, 95% CI 0.74-0.97, p=0.014). Coronary heart disease death and non-fatal myocardial infarction risk was also reduced (0.81, 0.69-0.94, p=0.006). Stroke risk was unaffected (1.03, 0.81-1.31, p=0.8), but the hazard ratio for transient ischaemic attack was 0.75 (0.55-1.00, p=0.051). New cancer diagnoses were more frequent on pravastatin than on placebo (1.25, 1.04-1.51, p=0.020). However, incorporation of this finding in a meta-analysis of all pravastatin and all statin trials showed no overall increase in risk. Mortality from coronary disease fell by 24% (p=0.043) in the pravastatin group. Pravastatin had no significant effect on cognitive function or disability. Pravastatin given for 3 years reduced the risk of coronary disease in elderly individuals. PROSPER therefore extends to elderly individuals the treatment strategy currently used in middle aged people.","The PROSPER trial, which was designed to test the effect of pravastatin Pravachol on coronary heart disease and stroke, randomized 5804 study participants into 1 group assigned to take pravastatin and another group assigned to take placebo. An additional study endpoint was pravastatin's effect on cognitive function as measured by 4 different tests, including the Mini-Mental Status Exam MMSE. Overall cognitive function declined at the same rate in treatment and placebo groups. There was no significant difference between the 2 groups over 3 years using 4 different methods of assessment. In particular, the MMSE scores differed by only 0.06 points 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.04-0.16; P=.26."
"How often is coughing the presenting complaint in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease
Gastroesophageal reflux is considered a common condition, but detailed population-based data on reflux in the United States are lacking. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and clinical spectrum of gastroesophageal reflux in Olmsted County, Minnesota. A reliable and valid self-report questionnaire was mailed to an age- and sex-stratified random sample of 2200 Olmsted County residents aged 25-74 years. The prevalence per 100 of heartburn and/or acid regurgitation experienced at least weekly was 19.8 (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 17.7-21.9). Heartburn and acid regurgitation were associated with noncardiac chest pain (odds ratio [OR], 4.2; 95% CI, 2.9-6.0), dysphagia (OR, 4.7; 95% CI, 2.9-7.4), dyspepsia (OR, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.9-5.0), and globus sensation (OR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.0-3.6) but not with asthma, hoarseness, bronchitis, or a history of pneumonia. Among subjects with reflux symptoms, 1.0% reported an episode of hematemesis and 1.3% had a past esophageal dilatation. Symptoms of reflux are common among white men and women who are 25-74 years of age. Heartburn and acid regurgitation are significantly associated with chest pain, dysphagia, dyspepsia, and globus sensation. The percentage of patients reporting complications is low, but the absolute number is probably considerable given the high prevalence of the condition in the community.","A population-based survey showed that symptoms of reflux and acid regurgitation are experienced by almost 60% of the population each year. The prevalence of frequent heartburn and acid reflux was approximately 20%. Bronchitis, defined as cough that occurs as often as 4 to 6 times per day on 4 or more days per week, was reported by more than 20% of those with frequent typical gastroesophageal reflux disease symptoms (occurring at least weekly) and by 15% of those with infrequent gastroesophageal reflux disease symptoms. Interestingly, bronchitis was reported by almost 11% of those without GERD. This study showed the association of cough with gastroesophageal reflux disease but did not address whether the cough was the initial presenting complaint."
"Sleep apnea in adults: How accurate is clinical prediction
One of the most common yet unidentified conditions in heart disease is sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). Although it is most prevalent in patients with heart failure, it has been epidemiologically and pathophysiologically linked to ischemic heart disease, hypertension, sudden cardiac death, atrial fibrillation, and stroke. There are two primary SDB syndromes: obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and central sleep apnea (CSA; also known as Cheyne-Stokes respiration). The pathophysiologic mechanisms that underlie these disorders appear to be distinct but both involve recurrent cycles of excessive sympathetic activation, hypoxemias and hypercapnias, and increases in ventricular wall stress. Signs and symptoms may include daytime somnolence, snoring, difficult-to-control hypertension, and refractory arrhythmias or angina. In heart failure, half of patients will have SDB and most patients will exhibit evidence of both OSA and CSA, although one or the other may predominate. The current standard diagnostic method is overnight laboratory polysomnography. Primary therapies for OSA include lifestyle changes, various facial and oral appliances, head and neck surgery, and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). CPAP is the most effective form of therapy for OSA, with few side effects, but is limited by compliance because of comfort-related issues. In patients with cardiovascular disease who predominantly suffer from OSA, treatment recommendations should be based on current guidelines for OSA. For patients with heart failure with predominant CSA, the current cornerstone of therapy is the optimization of medical therapy and resynchronization therapy when indicated. When SDB persists despite optimal medical management, referral to a sleep medicine consultant should be considered.","obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome is marked by daytime somnolence, snoring, difficult-to-control hypertension, refractory arrhythmias, angina, or heart failure."
"History, exam, and labs: Is one enough to diagnose acute adult appendicitis
We sought to develop a clinical predictive model for acute appendicitis and contrast it with current clinical practice. A prospective observational study of patients presenting with signs or symptoms consistent with acute appendicitis. Random-partition modeling was used to develop an appendicitis likelihood model (ALM). Four hundred thirty-nine patients were enrolled, 101 with appendicitis, and 338 with other diagnoses. The ALM classified patients as ""low likelihood"" if they had a white blood cell count <9,500 and either no right lower-quadrant tenderness or a neutrophil count <54%. Patients were classified as ""high likelihood"" if they had a white blood cell count >13,000 with rebound tenderness or both voluntary guarding and neutrophil count >82%. The ALM outperformed actual clinical practice with regard to ""missed"" appendicitis, negative laparotomies, and total number of imaging studies. The ALM may permit more judicious use of advanced radiographic imaging with lower nontherapeutic laparotomy rates.","The value of c-reactive protein in the evaluation of suspected appendicitis was confirmed in a retrospective evaluation of 566 patients who underwent appendectomies. The sensitivity and specificity of the test improved depending on the duration of symptoms for both appendicitis and ruptured appendicitis. For appendicitis, c-reactive protein levels >1.4, 4.0, and 10.5 on Days 1, 2, and 3 had sensitivities/specificities of 0.38/0.81, 0.63/0.78, and 0.72/0.83, respectively. For ruptured appendicitis, levels of 3.3, 8.5, and 12.0 on Days 1, 2, and 3 had sensitivities/specificities of 0.77/0.89, 0.70/0.95, and 0.90/0.96, respectively."
"What's the best treatment for CIN 2 or 3
Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) is the most common pre-malignant lesion. Atypical squamous changes occur in the transformation zone of the cervix with mild, moderate or severe changes described by their depth (CIN 1, 2 or 3). Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia is treated by local ablation or lower morbidity excision techniques. Choice of treatment depends on the grade and extent of the disease. To assess the effectiveness and safety of alternative surgical treatments for CIN. We searched the Cochrane Gynaecological Cancer Group Trials Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE and EMBASE (up to April 2009). We also searched registers of clinical trials, abstracts of scientific meetings and reference lists of included studies. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of alternative surgical treatments in women with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. Two review authors independently abstracted data and assessed risks of bias. Risk ratios that compared residual disease after the follow-up examination and adverse events in women who received one of either laser ablation, laser conisation, large loop excision of the transformation zone (LLETZ), knife conisation or cryotherapy were pooled in random-effects model meta-analyses. Twenty-nine trials were included. Seven surgical techniques were tested in various comparisons. No significant differences in treatment failures were demonstrated in terms of persistent disease after treatment. Large loop excision of the transformation zone appeared to provide the most reliable specimens for histology with the least morbidity. Morbidity was lower than with laser conisation, although the trials did not provide data for every outcome measure. There were not enough data to assess the effect on morbidity when compared with laser ablation. The evidence suggests that there is no obvious superior surgical technique for treating cervical intraepithelial neoplasia in terms of treatment failures or operative morbidity.","All 7 available surgical techniques were found to have similar efficacy, in a 2005 Cochrane review of 28 randomized trials. Resolution of CIN 2 or 3 lesions was 77% to 98%, using knife cone biopsy, laser conization, loop excision, laser ablation, cryotherapy, or 2 techniques not used commonly in the US, cold coagulation and radical diathermy. Surgical techniques were tested in various combinations, but no trial compared all of the techniques with one another. Most studies were underpowered, limiting the results."
"Does psychiatric treatment help patients with intractable chronic pain
To determine the strength of evidence for the effectiveness of mental health interventions for patients with three common somatic conditions (chronic fatigue syndrome, irritable bowel syndrome, and chronic back pain). To assess whether results obtained in secondary care can be extrapolated to primary care and suggest how future trials should be designed to provide more rigorous evidence. Systematic review. Five electronic databases, key texts, references in the articles identified, and citations from expert clinicians. Randomised controlled trials including participants with one of the three conditions for which no physical cause could be found. Two reviewers screened sources and independently extracted data and assessed quality. Sixty one studies were identified; 20 were classified as primary care and 41 as secondary care. For some interventions, such as brief psychodynamic interpersonal therapy, little research was identified. However, results of meta-analyses and of randomised controlled trials suggest that cognitive behaviour therapy and behaviour therapy are effective for chronic back pain and chronic fatigue syndrome and that antidepressants are effective for irritable bowel syndrome. Cognitive behaviour therapy and behaviour therapy were effective in both primary and secondary care in patients with back pain, although the evidence is more consistent and the effect size larger for secondary care. Antidepressants seem effective in irritable bowel syndrome in both settings but ineffective in chronic fatigue syndrome. Treatment seems to be more effective in patients in secondary care than in primary care. This may be because secondary care patients have more severe disease, they receive a different treatment regimen, or the intervention is more closely supervised. However, conclusions of effectiveness should be considered in the light of the methodological weaknesses of the studies. Large pragmatic trials are needed of interventions delivered in primary care by appropriately trained primary care staff.","A significant confounder in many of these studies may be that some treatments seem more effective in secondary care than in primary care settings, as based on a systemic review of interventions for somatic symptoms in primary care."
"Which nondrug alternatives can help with insomnia
Insomnia is a pervasive condition with various causes, manifestations, and health consequences. Regardless of the initial cause or event that precipitates insomnia, it is perpetuated into a chronic condition through learned behaviors and cognitions that foster sleeplessness. This article reviews the rationale and objectives of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), a safe and effective treatment for insomnia that may be used to augment hypnotic drugs or as a monotherapy. Cognitive-behavioral management of insomnia includes 3 components--behavioral, cognitive, and educational modules--and is usually presented in a group or individual therapy setting. Each treatment procedure is detailed herein, and recommendations for implementation are given. The evidence supporting this behavioral approach shows that CBT is effective for 70% to 80% of patients and that it can significantly reduce several measures of insomnia, including sleep-onset latency and wake-after-sleep onset. Aside from the clinically measurable changes, this therapy system enables many patients to regain a feeling of control over their sleep, thereby reducing the emotional distress that sleep disturbances cause. Some clinical and practical issues that often arise when implementing this therapeutic approach for insomnia are also discussed.",A systematic review with meta-analysis of 37 clinical investigations determined that stimulus control was the most effective cognitive-behavioral treatment intervention.
"What is the best test to detect herpes in skin lesions
Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) and varicella-zoster virus (VZV) cause a wide range of signs and symptoms, varying from trivial mucocutaneous lesions to life-threatening infections, especially in immuno-suppressed patients. Since antiviral drugs are available, rapid and sensitive laboratory diagnosis of these virus infections is important. To set up and evaluate HSV-1, HSV-2 and VZV qualitative real-time PCR on the Lightcycler system and to compare the results with those of the 'in-house' nested PCR and virus isolation. 110 consecutive samples from dermal or genital lesions from patients suspected of having HSV infections and another 110 samples from patients with suspected VZV infections were tested with real-time PCR, nested PCR and virus isolation. 24 samples (22%) were positive for HSV-1 by virus isolation and nested PCR, whereas 26 (24%) were positive by real-time PCR. HSV-2 was detected in 28 samples (25%) by virus isolation, in 41 (37%) by nested PCR and in 40 (36%) by real-time PCR. VZV was isolated in 15 samples (14%) and VZV DNA was detected in 51 samples (46%) by nested PCR as well as by real-time PCR. Nucleic acid amplification increased the detection rate of HSV-2 and VZV DNA in particular compared to virus isolation. No significant difference in sensitivity was found between real-time PCR and nested PCR. Real-time PCR has the advantage of rapid amplification, a reduced risk for contamination and it is a suitable method for diagnosis of VZV and HSV in specimens from skin lesions.","In 110 clinical samples from dermal or genital lesions of patients with suspected herpes simplex virus infection, the sensitivity of PCR was 98% (positive likelihood ratio [LR+]=∞ negative likelihood ratio [LR-]=0.02) compared with 73% (LR+ = ∞ LR- = 0.27) for culture. The specificities of both were 100%."
"What treatments work best for constipation in children
To assess the efficacy and safety of polyethylene glycol 3350 plus electrolytes (PEG+E) for the treatment of chronic constipation in children. Randomised, double blind, placebo controlled crossover trial, with two 2-week treatment periods separated by a 2-week placebo washout. Six UK paediatric departments. 51 children (29 girls, 22 boys) aged 24 months to 11 years with chronic constipation (lasting > or =3 months), defined as < or =2 complete bowel movements per week and one of the following: pain on defaecation on 25% of days; > or =25% of bowel movements with straining; > or =25% of bowel movements with hard/lumpy stools. 47 children completed the double blind treatment. Number of complete defaecations per week (primary efficacy variable), total number of complete and incomplete defaecations per week, pain on defaecation, straining on defaecation, faecal incontinence, stool consistency, global assessment of treatment, adverse events and physical examination. The mean number of complete defaecations per week was significantly higher for children on PEG+E than on placebo (3.12 (SD 2.05) v 1.45 (SD 1.20), respectively; p<0.001). Further significant differences in favour of PEG+E were observed for total number of defaecations per week (p = 0.003), pain on defaecation (p = 0.041), straining on defaecation (p<0.001), stool consistency (p<0.001) and percentage of hard stools (p = 0.001). Treatment related adverse events (all mild or moderate) occurred in similar numbers of children on PEG+E (41%) and placebo during treatment (45%). PEG+E is significantly more effective than placebo, and appears to be safe and well tolerated in the treatment of chronic constipation in children.","A recent high-quality randomized controlled trials compared the osmotic laxative polyethylene glycol 3350 plus electrolytes (PEG + E) with placebo in 51 children with CFC, 2 to 11 years of age. The mean number of defecations per week was higher for children on polyethylene glycol + E (3.12 vs 1.45; P<.001); straining or pain and stool consistency improved."
"What are the treatment options for SSRI-related sexual dysfunction
Sexual dysfunction and dissatisfaction are common symptoms associated with depression. Optimal antidepressant treatment should result in remission of the symptoms of the underlying illness and minimize the potential for short- and long-term adverse effects, including sexual dysfunction. Sexual dysfunction and dissatisfaction are frequently persistent or worsen with the use of some antidepressant medications; this sexual dysfunction and dissatisfaction can have negative impact on adherence to treatment, quality of life, and the possibility of relapse. Successful management of sexual complaints during antidepressant treatment should begin with a systematic approach to determine the type of sexual dysfunction, potential contributing factors, and finally management strategies that should be tailored to the individual patient. The basic physiologic mechanisms of the normal sexual phases of libido, arousal, and orgasm and how these mechanisms may be interrupted by some antidepressants provide a framework for the clinician to utilize in order to minimize sexual complaints when initiating and continuing antidepressant treatment. This article provides guidelines, based upon this type of model, for the assessment, management, and prevention of sexual side effects associated with antidepressant treatment.","Data suggest that bupropion, nefazodone, and mirtazapine have little to no effect on sexual functioning. Changing from SSRIs to one of these agents may alleviate SSRI-induced sexual dysfunction."
"How should we manage infants at risk for group B streptococcal disease
In 1996, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) issued guidelines for antepartum antibiotic prophylaxis of group B streptococcal (GBS)-positive women. The objective of this study is to document results of a GBS prophylaxis policy at one nonacademically affiliated, community hospital and discern its effectiveness with regard to compliance as well as in decreasing the incidence of early onset GBS (EOGBS) disease. The development of a GBS-prevention policy at the Women's Hospital of Greensboro (WHG) was documented by means of interviews and examination of minutes of meetings. Effectiveness of the policy was assessed by calculating the percentage of all GBS+ or unknown mothers who received antepartum antibiotics during a 1-year period. Additionally, all newborns with any positive GBS culture during the past 13 years at WHG were identified. The policy was formulated and distributed during a 6-month period by strong leadership, community ""buy-in,"" and an educational seminar. A preprinted physician order was written so that all GBS-positive/unknown mothers would receive antepartum antibiotics. Additionally, a clinical pathway was used to track and monitor maternal GBS status. During October 1, 1999 to September 30, 2000, 1124 (23.1%) mothers were found to be GBS positive/unknown. Of those who delivered an infant >37 weeks' gestation and who could be linked to the pharmacy database, 777 (91.1%) received antepartum antibiotics. The incidence of EOGBS disease at WHG before 1996 was 1.93 +/- 0.7/1000 births compared to 0.4 +/- 0.05/1000 after the issuance of the guidelines (p = 0.002, t-test). Over 90% of GBS-positive mothers were treated with antibiotics at WHG. Associated with this high adherence rate to the CDC guidelines has been a five-fold decrease in the incidence of EOGBS disease. We attribute these results to the implementation of a preprinted physician order sheet to direct intrapartum antibiotics for women with GBS positive or unknown colonization and the use of a clinical pathway to track GBS colonization status.",Implementation of these guidelines is aided by the adoption of an institution-wide policy to support point of care decision-making.
"How should a dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry scan be used to evaluate bisphosphonate therapy for osteoporosis
Antiresorptive agents are widely used to treat osteoporosis. We report the results of a multinational randomized, double-blind study, in which postmenopausal women with osteoporosis were treated with alendronate for up to 10 years. The initial three-year phase of the study compared three daily doses of alendronate with placebo. Women in the original placebo group received alendronate in years 4 and 5 and then were discharged. Women in the original active-treatment groups continued to receive alendronate during the initial extension (years 4 and 5). In two further extensions (years 6 and 7, and 8 through 10), women who had received 5 mg or 10 mg of alendronate daily continued on the same treatment. Women in the discontinuation group received 20 mg of alendronate daily for two years and 5 mg daily in years 3, 4, and 5, followed by five years of placebo. Randomized group assignments and blinding were maintained throughout the 10 years. We report results for the 247 women who participated in all four phases of the study. Treatment with 10 mg of alendronate daily for 10 years produced mean increases in bone mineral density of 13.7 percent at the lumbar spine (95 percent confidence interval, 12.0 to 15.5 percent), 10.3 percent at the trochanter (95 percent confidence interval, 8.1 to 12.4 percent), 5.4 percent at the femoral neck (95 percent confidence interval, 3.5 to 7.4 percent), and 6.7 percent at the total proximal femur (95 percent confidence interval, 4.4 to 9.1 percent) as compared with base-line values; smaller gains occurred in the group given 5 mg daily. The discontinuation of alendronate resulted in a gradual loss of effect, as measured by bone density and biochemical markers of bone remodeling. Safety data, including fractures and stature, did not suggest that prolonged treatment resulted in any loss of benefit. The therapeutic effects of alendronate were sustained, and the drug was well tolerated over a 10-year period. The discontinuation of alendronate resulted in the gradual loss of its effects.","Alendronate continues to increase BMD: following 10 years of treatment, it increased bone mineral density by 13.7% in the lumbar spine, 6.7% in the total hip, and 5.4 % in the femoral neck."
"Are beta-2-agonists or anticholinergics more effective for treating COPD
Inhaled bronchodilators form the mainstay of treatment for acute exacerbations of COPD. Two types of agent are used routinely, either singly or in combination: anticholinergic agents and beta2-sympathomimetic agonists. To assess the effect of anti-cholinergic agents on lung function and dyspnea in patients with acute exacerbations of COPD, compared with placebo or short-acting beta-2 agonists. A comprehensive search of the literature was carried out on MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and the Cochrane COPD Trials Register, using the terms: bronchodilator* OR ipratropium OR oxitropium. References listed in each included trial were searched for additional trial reports. Studies were included if the participants were adult patients with a known diagnosis of COPD and had symptoms consistent with criteria for acute exacerbation of COPD. All randomized controlled trials that compared inhaled ipratropium bromide or oxitropium bromide to appropriate controls were considered. Appropriate control treatments included placebo, other bronchodilating agents, or combination therapies. Studies of acute asthma or ventilated patients were excluded. All trials that appeared to be relevant were assessed by two reviewers who independently selected trials for inclusion. Differences were resolved by consensus. Four trials compared the short-term effects of ipratropium bromide vs. a beta2-agonist. Short-term changes in FEV1 (up to 90 minutes) showed no significant difference between beta2-agonist and ipratropium bromide treated patients. The differences were similar among the studies and when combined: Weighted Mean Difference (WMD) 0.0 liters (95% Confidence Interval (95% CI) -0.19, 0.19). There was no significant additional increase in change in FEV1 on adding ipratropium to beta2-agonist: WMD 0.02 liter (95% CI -0.08, 0.12). Long-term effects (24 hours) of the ipratropium bromide and beta2-agonist treatment combination were similar: WMD 0.05 liters (95%CI -0.14, 0.05). Neither of two studies found significant changes in PaO2, either short- or long-term, with ipratropium vs. beta-agonist, although one showed an increase in PaO2 in subjects receiving ipratropium bromide at 60 minutes. Adverse drug reactions included dry mouth and tremor. There was no evidence that the degree of bronchodilation achieved with ipratropium bromide was greater than that using a short-acting beta2-agonist. The combination of a beta2-agonist and ipratropium did not appear to increase the effect on FEV1 more than either used alone.","A recent Cochrane Review comparing the short-term effects of ipratropium to β2-agonists in changes in FEV1and arterial oxygen pressure (PaO2) concluded there was no evidence that the degree of bronchodilation from ipratropium was greater than that from short-acting β2-agonists. Subjective endpoints such as dyspnea and quality of life were not assessed, and neither of the above reviews included studies focusing on long-term outcomes."
"What effect do inhaled steroids have on delaying the progression of COPD
To determine the effect of long term inhaled corticosteroids on lung function, exacerbations, and health status in patients with moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Double blind, placebo controlled study. Eighteen UK hospitals. Participants: 751 men and women aged between 40 and 75 years with mean forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV(1)) 50% of predicted normal. Interventions: Inhaled fluticasone propionate 500 microgram twice daily from a metered dose inhaler or identical placebo. Main outcome measures: Efficacy measures: rate of decline in FEV(1) after the bronchodilator and in health status, frequency of exacerbations, respiratory withdrawals. Safety measures: morning serum cortisol concentration, incidence of adverse events. There was no significant difference in the annual rate of decline in FEV(1 )(P=0.16). Mean FEV(1) after bronchodilator remained significantly higher throughout the study with fluticasone propionate compared with placebo (P<0.001). Median exacerbation rate was reduced by 25% from 1.32 a year on placebo to 0.99 a year on with fluticasone propionate (P=0.026). Health status deteriorated by 3.2 units a year on placebo and 2.0 units a year on fluticasone propionate (P=0.0043). Withdrawals because of respiratory disease not related to malignancy were higher in the placebo group (25% v 19%, P=0.034). Fluticasone propionate 500 microgram twice daily did not affect the rate of decline in FEV(1) but did produce a small increase in FEV(1). Patients on fluticasone propionate had fewer exacerbations and a slower decline in health status. These improvements in clinical outcomes support the use of this treatment in patients with moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.","Exacerbation rates significantly decreased by 25% (P=.026), and health status improved (P=.0043) among patients with moderate to severe COPD who were taking fluticasone compared with those taking placebo."
"Does birth weight predict childhood obesity
To identify the risk factors of obesity in preschool children in China. A nationwide case-control study in eight cities in China. A total of 748 boys and 574 girls (age 0.1 - 6.9 y), including the obese and non-obese. One obese child was matched with one non-obese child by sex and age. Weight, height and other measurements were taken for all the subjects. The information on child activity, feeding pattern and family background was collected by our study team from the parents and the kindergarten teacher. Birth weight > or =4.0 kg, high eating speed, obesity among the child's relatives > or =25%, mother's body mass index (BMI) > 25 kg/m2 and father's BMI > 25 kg/m2 were identified as the major significant (P < 0.05) risk factors of obesity in preschool children in China. Family history of obesity, high birth weight and eating speed were identified as the risk factors of obesity in preschool children in China. Our results show the need for family therapy as part of an intervention program for childhood obesity, which includes behavior modification.","A large Chinese population-based, case-control study (N=1322), found birth weight above 4.0 kg to be a risk factor for obesity in preschool-age children (OR=3.77; 95% CI, 2.06-6.29). The absolute rate of overweight increased from 8% to 26% among large-for-gestational-age infants."
"When is it OK for children to start drinking fruit juice
To assess adherence to infant feeding recommendations among a sample of infants and toddlers four to 24 months of age in the United States. Descriptive analysis of data collected in the 2002 Feeding Infants and Toddlers Study (FITS) based on telephone interviews and 24-hour dietary recalls collected with the Nutrition Data System for Research of the University of Minnesota. A national random sample of 3,022 infants and toddlers age four to 24 months, including 2,024 infants age four to 11 months. Breastfeeding, timing of introduction of complementary foods, and adherence to infant feeding recommendations. Means and standard errors, percentile distributions, and percentages by age group (four to six months, seven to eight months, and nine to 11 months). About 76% of infants and toddlers were fully or partly breastfed at birth. This percentage declined to 30% at six months and 16% at 12 months-short of Healthy People 2010 goals of 50% and 25%, respectively. The average duration of breastfeeding was 5.5 months for all who initiated breastfeeding. About two-thirds of infants had been introduced to complementary foods between four and six months-the period recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP); 17% consumed juice before the AAP recommended age of six months or later. Twenty-two percent of infants nine to 11 months consumed cow's milk on a daily basis before the recommended age of 12 months or later, and one in 10 consumed french fries and/or sweetened beverages on any given day. More parents and caregivers can benefit from guidance about the introduction of developmentally appropriate, micronutrient-rich first solid foods such as iron-rich infant cereals, iron-fortified grain products, meats, soft fruits, and cooked vegetables and the importance of breastfeeding through the first year of life. A smaller proportion of parents and caregivers require guidance on delaying the introduction of juices until six months of age and cow's milk other than formula until one year of age.",One in 5 infants routinely drinks juice before 6 months of age.
"Do any folk remedies or herbals help induce labor
There is a lack of basic knowledge on the part of both clinicians and patients as to the indications for use and safety of herbal medicines in pregnancy and lactation. This is one article in a series that systematically reviews the evidence for commonly used herbs during pregnancy and lactation. To systematically review the literature for evidence on the use, safety and pharmacology of blue cohosh, focusing on issues pertaining to pregnancy and lactation. We searched 7 electronic databases and compiled data according to the grade of evidence found. According to a survey of midwives in the United States, approximately 64% of midwives reported using blue cohosh as a labour-inducing aid. There are three case reports in the scientific literature that blue cohosh taken at the time of delivery may cause; 1) perinatal stroke, 2) acute myocardial infarction, profound congestive heart failure and shock and 3) severe multi-organ hypoxic injury. There is one case report that blue cohosh possesses abortifacient properties. There is in vitro evidence that blue cohosh may have teratogenic, embryotoxic and oxytoxic effects. In lactation, the safety of blue cohosh is unknown. Based on the available scientific information, blue cohosh should; 1) be used with extreme caution during pregnancy, 2) be used only under medical professional supervision and 3) not be available to the public as an over-the-counter product. There is an urgent need to conduct a retrospective or prospective cohort study of midwifes using blue cohosh in order to determine its safety. Key words: Blue cohosh, caulophyllum thalictroides, pregnancy, lactation, breastfeeding, systematic review.","A systematic review of the literature on blue cohosh found only in vitro studies of efficacy (increased estradiol-induced transcription in estrogen-responsive cells and increased tone in excised guinea pig uteri) and 3 case reports of maternal adverse events after ingestion (perinatal stroke, congestive heart failure with shock, and multiorgan hypoxic injury). In vitro evidence presented in the review suggests that blue cohosh may have teratogenic, embryotoxic, and oxytocic effects."
"When should a child with an undescended testis be referred to a urologist
One-hundred thirty-seven patients with a history or clinical evidence of cryptorchidism and testicular germinal tumor were treated at our hospital from 1934 to 1976. Cryptorchidism was corrected ipsilaterally or contralaterally in 93 patients with intrascrotal testis cancer when they were from 2 to 42 years old, either spontaneously (24 patients), by orchiopexy (58 patients), or by hormonal therapy (11 patients). Forty-four cryptorchid patients (uncorrected cases) had either ipsilateral inguinal (24 patients), or abdominal (14 patients), or contralateral intrascrotal tumors (six patients). Tumor histologic types on orchiectomy were pure seminoma in 56 patients, embryonal carcinoma in 41, teratocarcinoma in 37, and pure choriocarcinoma in 3. The five-year survival rates were similar in the corrected (61%) and uncorrected (63%) cases, and they were higher in patients with pure seminoma (79%) than in patients with germinal carcinomas (50%). The majority (64 of 80) of five-year survivors received regional lymphatic irradiation in 41 patients with pure seminoma and/or systemic chemotherapy in 23 patients with other germinomas. Since the testicular tumors that developed despite correction of the cryptorchid state were predominantly (72%) germinal carcinomas, unilateral cryptorchidism, which usually is associated with testicular atrophy, should be treated by orchiectomy instead of orchiopexy to prevent ipsilateral carcinogenesis. Cryptorchid patients with testicles that descended late should be observed periodically, especially after the 20-year latent period, for early detection of cancer.","A retrospective cohort study of 137 men with cryptorchidism who developed testicular cancer found no difference in 5-year survival between those who had orchiopexy (at ages 2 to 42) and those who had not (61% vs 63%, respectively."
"How should you manage a depressed patient unresponsive to an SSRI
Although the newer antidepressants are widely used, little is known about how long it takes to see their full effect. The authors sought to determine how many weeks a fluoxetine trial with no improvement should continue before treatment is changed. The data involved 840 patients in a 12-week open trial of fluoxetine, 20 mg/day, followed by a blinded, placebo-controlled discontinuation study. Outcomes at 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 weeks were classified as nonresponse, partial response, response, and remission and were based on Hamilton Depression Rating Scale scores. The rate of remission at week 12 was calculated for each group of patients without remission at the earlier time points. The time to relapse during weeks 13-26 of the discontinuation study was examined in patients taking placebo and fluoxetine in relation to status at week 6. Patients unimproved at week 6 had a remission rate at week 12 of 31%-41%. For patients with remission at week 12, level of improvement at week 6 did not affect prognosis in weeks 13-26. Of the unimproved patients at week 8, 23% had remissions by week 12. The week 12 remission rate for unimproved patients at week 4 was clearly high enough to justify continued treatment; the rate for unimproved patients at week 10 was too low. These data suggest that nonresponse to fluoxetine should not be declared until 8 weeks of treatment have elapsed. Practitioners should discuss trial length with patients at the beginning of treatment.","The first step in treatment-resistant depression should be optimizing dose and duration of therapy. For fluoxetine (Prozac), based on a nonrandomized open trial, patients should receive 8 weeks of treatment before the SSRI course is deemed adequate. Only 23% of patients who have not responded to 8 weeks of fluoxetine respond to a still longer course of fluoxetine."
"Which nondrug alternatives can help with insomnia
This study was conducted to test the effectiveness of an abbreviated cognitive-behavioral insomnia therapy (ACBT) with primary A single-blind, randomized group design was used in which study patients were randomized to either a brief, 2-session ACBT or a similarly brief intervention (SHC) that included only generic sleep hygiene recommendations. A university-affiliated Department of Veterans Affairs medical center. Twenty (2 women) veteran patients (M(age) = 51.0 yrs., SD = 13.7 years) who met criteria for chronic primary insomnia. Participants completed sleep logs for 2 weeks and questionnaires to measures insomnia symptoms, sleep-related self-efficacy, and dysfunctional beliefs about sleep before treatment, during a 2-week posttreatment assessment, and again at a 3-month posttreatment follow-up. Statistical analyses showed that ACBT produced significantly larger improvements across a majority of outcome measures than did SHC. Case-by-case analyses showed that only the ACBT produced consistent positive effects across study patients, and a sizeable proportion of these patients receiving this treatment achieved clinically significant improvements by their study endpoints. Approximately 52% of those receiving the ACBT reported at least a 50% reduction in their wake time after sleep onset, and 55.6% of ACBT-treated patients who entered the study with pathologic scores on an Insomnia Symptom Questionnaire (ISQ), achieved normal ISQ scores by their final outcome assessment. ACBT is effective for reducing subjective sleep disturbance and insomnia symptoms in primary care patients.","Researchers conducting a single-blind randomized group study in a Veterans Affairs primary care clinic concluded that an abbreviated cognitive-behavioral treatment approach with two 25-minute sessions effectively improved participant sleep onset latency, and time awake after sleep onset. Researchers reviewed participants' sleep logs and a behavioral health provider offered patients a condensed education on sleep hygiene, stimulus control, and sleep restrictions strategies. The study was limited because of small sample size (<25). Generalizability to practice is restricted because sessions were conducted by a behavioral health provider, not a family physician."
"Do calcium supplements prevent postmenopausal osteoporotic fractures
The preferable source of calcium is a balanced diet, but medicinal supplements are sometimes necessary if patients are to reach desired intakes. A divided dose regimen (4x/d; i.e., with meals and at bedtime) results in substantially greater absorption of a supplement than does 1x/d dosing. However, differences in chemical solubility between supplement preparations are of little importance, with calcium carbonate preparations, for example, being absorbed as well or better than some much more highly soluble salts. Gastric acid is not necessary for absorption of even poorly soluble preparations, so long as they are taken with meals. Because typical patients exhibit a wide range of absorption efficiencies, it is desirable to assess absorption fraction before beginning a supplement regimen. (Some patients will need three times as large a dose as others to absorb the same amount of calcium.) Calcium intakes up to at least 62.5 mmol (2500 mg) are safe for virtually all patients.","Daily supplementation of calcium (500-1200 mg) along with vitamin D (700-800 IU) is the regimen best supported by the evidence. Since the absorption of calcium decreases with single doses above 500 mg, the studies that used 1000-1200 mg of calcium split the daily doses."
"Do any folk remedies or herbals help induce labor
To document the use of herbal preparations for cervical ripening, induction, and augmentation of labor by certified nurse-midwives (CNMs) and nurse-midwifery education programs, a national survey of 500 members of the American College of Nurse-Midwives was conducted. Forty eight nurse-midwifery education programs were also surveyed to determine whether they were formally or informally educating students in the use of herbal preparations for cervical ripening, induction, or augmentation of labor. The results of this study, a review of the literature, professional issues, and recommendations for clinical practice are presented in this article. Of 500 questionnaires mailed to ACNM members, 90 were returned from CNMs who used herbal preparations to stimulate labor and 82 were returned from CNMs who did not use herbal preparations to stimulate labor. Three questionnaires were excluded due to incomplete data or blank questionnaires. No significant differences were noted in relations to geographical region, midwifery education, or highest level of education between the CNM respondents who did and those who did not use alternative methods to stimulate labor. Of the CNMs who used herbal preparations to stimulate labor, 64% used blue cohosh, 45% used black cohosh, 63% used red raspberry leaf, 93% used castor oil, and 60% used evening primrose oil. CNMs who used herbal preparations to stimulate labor were younger (43 versus 45 years, P < .01) and more likely to deliver at home or in an in-hospital or out-of-hospital birthing center (P < .0006), than CNMs who never used herbal preparations to stimulate labor. The most cited reason for using herbal preparations to stimulate labor was that they are ""natural,"" whereas the most common reason for not using herbal preparations was the lack of research or experience with the safety of these substances. Sixty-nine percent of CNMs who used herbal preparations to stimulate labor learned about using them from other CNMs, 4% from formal research publications, and none from their formal education programs. Although 78% of the CNMs who used herbal preparations to stimulate labor directly prescribed them and 70% indirectly suggested them to clients, only 22% had included them within their written practice protocols. Seventy-five percent of the CNMs who used herbal preparations to stimulate labor used them first or instead of pitocin. Twenty-one percent reported complications including precipitous labor, tetanic uterine contractions, nausea, and vomiting. Sixty-four percent of the nurse-midwifery education programs included instruction in the use of herbal preparations to stimulate labor in their formal curricula, and 92% included informal discussions on the use of herbal preparations. Evening primrose oil was the most common herbal preparation discussed in nurse-midwifery education programs. Castor oil was the most commonly used herbal preparation used by nurse-midwives in clinical practice.",A review of herbal preparations used by midwives reported a case of an infant with low Apgar scores after black cohosh use. The article described black cohosh as potentially unsafe because of the lack of trials demonstrating safety and possible deleterious estrogenic effects.
"What screening tests should you use to evaluate a man with low testosterone
In these clinical practice guidelines, specific recommendations are made for determining the most effective methods of diagnosing and treating hypogonadism in adult male patients. The target populations for these guidelines include the following: (1) men with primary testicular failure requiring testosterone replacement (hypergonadotropic hypogonadism); (2) male patients with gonadotropin deficiency or dysfunction who may have received testosterone replacement therapy or treatment for infertility (hypogonadotropic hypogonadism); and (3) aging men with symptoms relating to testosterone deficiency who could benefit from testosterone replacement therapy. Initial hormonal evaluation generally consists of a testosterone determination, in conjunction with a free testosterone or sex hormone-binding globulin level, inpatients with clear symptoms and signs but normal-range total testosterone, follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, and prolactin levels. Other possible tests include semen analysis, pituitary imaging studies, genetic studies, bone densitometry, testicular ultrasonography,testicular biopsy, and specialized hormonal dynamic testing. Therapeutic options generally consist of testosterone replacement by injections, patches, or topically applied gel in hypergonadotropic patients and in hypogonadotropic patients not interested in fertility. In hypogonadotropic patients interested in fertility, gonadal stimulation option scan be considered, including human chorionic gonadotropin stimulation therapy with or without human menopausal gonadotropin (or follicle-stimulating hormone) or gonadotropin-releasing hormone pump therapy. These therapies may be combined with assisted reproductive technologies such as in vitro fertilization with intracytoplasmic sperm injection, which may allow pregnancy to occur with very low numbers of sperm.","Hypogonadism is a common endocrinologic disorder in men. Advancing age, increased life expectancy, and a rising prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes may increase the occurrence of hypogonadism."
"Do statins delay onset or slow progression of Alzheimer's dementia
Dementia affects an estimated 10% of the population older than 65 years. Because vascular and lipid-related mechanisms are thought to have a role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia, we did an epidemiological study of the potential effect of HMGCoA (3 hydroxy-3methylglutaryl-coenzyme A) reductase inhibitors (statins) and other lipid-lowering agents on dementia. We used a nested case-control design with information derived from 368 practices which contribute to the UK-based General Practice Research Database. The base study population included three groups of patients age 50 years and older: all individuals who had received lipid-lowering agents (LLAs); all individuals with a clinical diagnosis of untreated hyperlipidaemia; and a randomly selected group of other individuals. From this base population, all cases with a computer-recorded clinical diagnosis of dementia were identified. Each case was matched with up to four controls derived from the base population on age, sex, practice, and index date of case. The study encompassed 284 cases with dementia and 1080 controls. Among controls 13% had untreated hyperlipidaemia, 11% were prescribed statins, 7% other LLAs, and 69% had no hyperlipidaemia or LLA exposure. The relative risk estimates of dementia adjusted for age, sex, history of coronary-artery disease, hypertension, coronary-bypass surgery and cerebral ischaemia, smoking and body mass index for individuals with untreated hyperlipidaemia (odds ratio 0.72 [95% CI 0.45-1.14]), or treated with nonstatin LLAs (0.96 [0.47-1.97], was close to 1.0 and not significant compared with people who had no diagnosis of hyperlipidaemia or exposure to other lipid-lowering drugs. The adjusted relative risk for those prescribed statins was 0.29 (0.13-0.63; p=0.002). Individuals of 50 years and older who were prescribed statins had a substantially lowered risk of developing dementia, independent of the presence or absence of untreated hyperlipidaemia, or exposure to nonstatin LLAs. The available data do not distinguish between Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia.","A nested case-control study of 1364 patients found an adjusted relative risk for dementia of 0.29 95% CI, 0.013-0.063; P=.002 among those taking statins. This study did not distinguish between Alzheimer's dementia and other forms of dementia. These studies do not demonstrate a causal relationship between statins and Alzheimer's dementia."
"For those intolerant to angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors and ARBs, what is the best therapy for reducing the risk of diabetic nephropathy
To test whether microalbuminuria in patients with type 2 diabetes and hypertension is primarily dependent on the severity of hypertension, and to compare the effectiveness of two antihypertensive drugs with opposite effects on the renin-angiotensin system [the diuretic, indapamide sustained release (SR), and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, enalapril] in reducing microalbuminuria. A multinational, multicentre, controlled, double-blind, double-dummy, randomized, two-parallel-groups study over 1 year. After a 4-week placebo run-in period, 570 patients (ages 60.0 +/- 9.9 years, 64% men) with type 2 diabetes, essential hypertension [systolic blood pressure (SBP) 140-180 mmHg, and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) < 110 mmHg], and persistent microalbuminuria (20-200 microg/min) were allocated randomly to groups to receive indapamide SR 1.5 mg (n = 284) or enalapril 10 mg (n = 286) once a day. Amlodipine, atenolol, or both were added, if necessary, to achieve the target blood pressure of 140/85 mmHg. There was a significant reduction in the urinary albumin : creatinine ratio. Mean reductions were 35% [95% confidence interval (CI) 24 to 43] and 39% (95% CI 30 to 47%) in the indapamide SR and enalapril groups, respectively. Equivalence was demonstrated between the two groups [1.08 (95% CI 0.89 to 1.31%); P = 0.01]. The reductions in mean arterial pressure (MAP) were 16.6 +/- 9.0 mmHg for the indapamide SR group and 15.0 +/- 9.1 mmHg for the enalapril group (NS); the reduction in SBP was significantly greater (P = 0.0245 ) with indapamide SR. More than 50% of patients in each group required additional antihypertensive therapy, with no differences between groups. Both treatments were well tolerated. Indapamide-SR-based therapy is equivalent to enalapril-based therapy in reducing microalbuminuria with effective blood pressure reduction in patients with hypertension and type 2 diabetes.","The NESTOR study-a multinational, multicenter, double-blind, randomized controlled, 2-parallel-groups study over 1 year-found that indapamide SR (a thiazide-type diuretic) treatment is as efficacious as enalapril in reducing proteinuria and lowering blood pressure."
"Do patients at high risk of Alzheimer's disease benefit from early treatment
To evaluate the efficacy of a cognitive-motor program in patients with early Alzheimer disease (AD) who are treated with a cholinesterase inhibitor (ChEI). Patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (12), mild AD (48), and moderate AD (24) (Global Deterioration Scale stages 3, 4, and 5) were randomized to receive psychosocial support plus cognitive-motor intervention (experimental group) or psychosocial support alone (control group). Cognitive-motor intervention (CMI) consisted of a 1-year structured program of 103 sessions of cognitive exercises, plus social and psychomotor activities. The primary efficacy measure was the cognitive subscale of the AD Assessment Scale (ADAS-cog). Secondary efficacy measures were the Mini-Mental State Examination, the Functional Activities Questionnaire, and the Geriatric Depression Scale. Evaluations were conducted at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months by blinded evaluators. Patients in the CMI group maintained cognitive status at month 6, whereas patients in the control group had significantly declined at that time. Cognitive response was higher in the patients with fewer years of formal education. In addition, more patients in the experimental group maintained or improved their affective status at month 12 (experimental group, 75%; control group, 47%; p = 0.017). A long-term CMI in ChEI-treated early Alzheimer disease patients produced additional mood and cognitive benefits.",An randomized controlled trials of galantamine showed initial cognitive improvement in mild cognitive impairment patients.
"What is the best way to evaluate an acute traumatic knee injury
The Ottawa knee rule is a clinical decision aid that helps rule out fractures and avoid unnecessary radiography. To summarize evidence about the accuracy of the Ottawa knee rule. Relevant English- and non-English-language articles were identified from PreMEDLINE and MEDLINE (1966-2003), EMBASE (1980-2003), CINAHL (1982-2003), BIOSIS (1990-2003), the Cochrane Library (2002, Issue 3), the Science Citation Index database, reference lists of included studies, and experts. Articles were included if they reported enough information to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the Ottawa knee rule for detecting fractures confirmed either radiologically or in combination with follow-up. Two reviewers independently extracted data on study samples, the ways that the Ottawa knee rule was used, and methodologic characteristics of studies. Of 11 identified studies, 6 involving 4249 adult patients were considered appropriate for pooled analysis. The pooled negative likelihood ratio was 0.05 (95% CI, 0.02 to 0.23), the pooled sensitivity was 98.5% (CI, 93.2% to 100%), and the pooled specificity was 48.6% (CI, 43.4% to 51.0%). A negative result on an Ottawa knee rule test accurately excluded knee fractures after acute knee injury. However, because the rule is calibrated toward 100% sensitivity and actual fracture prevalences are usually low, large-scale, multicentered studies are still needed to establish the cost-effectiveness of routinely implementing the rule.","In a systematic review, the Ottawa rules had a pooled negative likelihood ratio (LR-) of 0.05 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.02-0.23)."
"Does neonatal circumcision decrease morbidity
It is well recognized that the presence of a foreskin predisposes to penile carcinoma and sexually transmitted infections. We have investigated the relationship between the presence or absence of the foreskin and penile dermatoses. To determine whether there is an association between circumcision and penile dermatoses. A retrospective case control study of patients attending the department of dermatology with genital skin conditions. The study population consisted of 357 male patients referred for diagnosis and management of genital skin disease. The control population consisted of 305 male patients without genital skin disease attending the general dermatology clinics over a 4-month period. The relationship between circumcision and the presence or absence of skin disease involving the penis was investigated. The rate of circumcision in the general male dermatology population was determined. The most common diagnoses were psoriasis (n = 94), penile infections (n = 58), lichen sclerosus (n = 52), lichen planus (n = 39), seborrheic dermatitis (n = 29), and Zoon balanitis (n = 27). Less common diagnoses included squamous cell carcinoma (n = 4), bowenoid papulosis (n = 3), and Bowen disease (n = 3). The age-adjusted odds ratio for all penile skin diseases associated with presence of the foreskin was 3.24 (95% confidence interval, 2.26-4.64). All patients with Zoon balanitis, bowenoid papulosis, and nonspecific balanoposthitis were uncircumcised. Lichen sclerosus was diagnosed in only 1 circumcised patient. Most patients with psoriasis, lichen planus, and seborrheic eczema (72%, 69%, and 72%, respectively) were uncircumcised at presentation. The majority of men with penile infections (84%) were uncircumcised. Most cases of inflammatory dermatoses were diagnosed in uncircumcised men, suggesting that circumcision protects against inflammatory dermatoses. The presence of the foreskin may promote inflammation by a köebnerization phenomenon, or the presence of infectious agents, as yet unidentified, may induce inflammation. The data suggest that circumcision prevents or protects against common infective penile dermatoses.","In a series of 89 men with penile cancer, only 2 had been circumcised in infancy, while 87 were uncircumcised."
"What is the most effective and safe malaria prophylaxis during pregnancy
Women are more vulnerable to malaria during pregnancy, and malaria infection may have adverse consequences for the fetus. Identifying safe and effective treatments is important. To compare the effects of drug regimens for treating uncomplicated falciparum malaria in pregnant women. We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register (May 2005), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2005), MEDLINE (1966 to May 2005), EMBASE (1974 to May 2005), LILACS (May 2005), reference lists, and conference abstracts. We also contacted researchers in the field, organizations, and pharmaceutical companies. Randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials of antimalarial drugs for treating uncomplicated malaria in pregnant women. Both authors assessed trial eligibility and methodological quality, and extracted data. We performed a quantitative analysis only where we could combine the data. We combined dichotomous data using relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Six trials (513 participants) met the inclusion criteria. Two were quasi-randomized, and none described allocation concealment. Data were scarce for the primary outcome, treatment failure. One trial compared artesunate plus mefloquine with quinine and reported fewer treatment failures at day 63 with the combination (RR 0.09, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.38; 106 participants). There is insufficient reliable research on malaria treatment options in pregnancy.","Antimalarials were found to decrease the incidence of maternal infections relative risk [RR]=0.27; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.17-0.44 and reduce maternal anemia RR=0.62; 95% CI, 0.50-0.78 in low-parity women-ie, during a first or second pregnancy."
"What medications are safe and effective for heartburn during pregnancy
Our purpose was to determine whether omeprazole use during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of malformations, spontaneous abortions, decreased birth weight, or perinatal complications. In a multicenter, prospective controlled study, pregnant women exposed to omeprazole during gestation were matched with controls exposed to nonteratogens and with disease-paired controls who used histamine blockers for similar indications. The primary end point was the incidence of major malformations. One hundred thirteen pregnant women were exposed to omeprazole during pregnancy. Rates of major malformations in the omeprazole group (4%) did not differ from controls exposed to nonteratogens (2%) (P = .68, relative risk = 1.94, 95% confidence interval 0.36 to 10.36) and disease-paired controls (2.8%). Birth weight, gestational age at delivery, preterm deliveries, and neonatal complications were comparable among the three groups. No association was found between exposure to omeprazole during the period of organogenesis and increased risk for major malformations. Exposure throughout pregnancy is not associated with increased risk of spontaneous abortions, decreased birth weight, or perinatal complications.","In nonpregnant adults, proton pump inhibitors are more effective than antacids and H2-blockers for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). No cohort or control studies have been performed on their efficacy in pregnancy. On the basis of animal studies, omeprazole is a category C drug (potential benefit of use should outweigh potential risks). A cohort study of 113 women found no associated anomalies (relative risk=1.94; 95% confidence interval, 0.36-10.36). Pantoprazole, lansoprazole and rabeprazole are category B medications."
"Does a low-salt diet reduce morbidity and mortality in congestive heart failure
To compare the effects of a multimodal nonpharmacologic intervention to digoxin and to placebo in patients with congestive heart failure receiving background therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Randomized, parallel assignment to three treatment groups of 20 patients with congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association Class II and III). Nonpharmacologic treatment program included the following: (1) graduated exercise training, three to five times per week; (2) structured cognitive therapy and stress management; and (3) dietary intervention aimed at salt reduction and weight reduction in the overweight. Digoxin was titrated to achieve a blood level between 0.8 and 2.0 ng/ml. Placebo and digoxin were administered in a randomized, double-blind fashion. Echocardiographic ejection fraction improved (p < 0.05) in the digitalis group (change = +4.4 +/- 6.5) compared with both placebo (change = -3.2 +/- 3.9) and nonpharmacologic therapy (change = -3.2 +/- 3.9). The nonpharmacologic treatment program was well tolerated by all patients and resulted in significant improvement (p < 0.05) in exercise tolerance (digoxin = +51 +/- 50 s, placebo = +91 +/- 76, nonpharmacologic therapy = +182 +/- 139), as well as Beck Depression Inventory score (digoxin = +1.2 +/- 4.4, placebo = +2.0 +/- 4.2, nonpharmacologic therapy = -5.0 +/- 4.2), Hamilton Scale scores of anxiety (digoxin = +3.0 +/- 6.8, placebo = +6.0 +/- 2.6, nondrug therapy = -5.2 +/- 5.4), and depression (digoxin = +1.0 +/- 4.9, placebo = +5.0 +/- 5.0, nonpharmacologic therapy = -6.6 +/- 10.1). In addition, weight loss was significantly greater with nonpharmacologic therapy (digoxin = +0.32 +/- 1.76 kg; placebo = -1.35 +/- 1.44 kg; nonpharmacologic therapy = -4.37 +/- 4.50 kg) compared with both digoxin and placebo. Nonpharmacologic therapy improved functional capacity, body weight, and mood state in patients with congestive heart failure. In contrast, digoxin improved ejection fraction without corresponding changes in exercise tolerance or quality of life.","A small randomized controlled trials compared a program of exercise, cognitive therapy/stress management, salt restriction, and weight reduction to treating congestive heart failure with digoxin or placebo. The nondrug interventions improved functional capacity, body weight, and mood but not ejection fraction in patients with congestive heart failure."
"What are contraindications to IUDs
A WHO expert group and the International Planned Parenthood Federation recommend against use of intrauterine devices (IUDs) in HIV-1-infected women based on theoretical concerns about pelvic infection and increased blood loss. We investigated whether the risk of complications after IUD insertion is higher in HIV-1-infected women than in non-infected women. 649 (156 HIV-1 infected 493 non-infected) women in Nairobi, Kenya, who requested and met local eligibility criteria for insertion of an IUD were enrolled. We gathered information on IUD-related complications, including pelvic inflammatory disease, removals due to infection, pain, or bleeding, expulsions, and pregnancies at 1 and 4 months after insertion. Patients' HIV-1 status was masked from physicians. Complications were identified in 48 of 615 women (11 [7.6%] HIV-1-infected women, 37 [7.9%] non-infected). Incident pelvic inflammatory disease (two [1.4%] HIV-1 infected, one [0.2%] non-infected) and infection-related complications (any tenderness, removal of IUD for infection or pain; ten [6.9%] HIV-1 infected, 27 [5.7%] non-infected) were also rare and similar in the two groups. Complication rates were similar by CD4 (immune) status. Multivariate analyses suggested no association between HIV-1 infection and increased risks for overall complications (odds ratio 0.8 [95% CI 0.4-1.7]) or infection-related complications (1.0 [0.5-2.3]), adjusted for marital status, study site, previous IUD use, ethnic origin, and frequency of sexual intercourse, but a slight increase cannot be ruled out. Our data suggest that IUDs may be a safe contraceptive method for appropriately selected HIV-1-infected women with continuing access to medical services. Both the International Planned Parenthood Federation and the World Health Organization have warned against use of IUDs in HIV-infected women due to theoretical concerns about pelvic infection and increased blood loss.  No published studies have investigated this concern, however.  The validity of this recommendation was investigated in a comparative study of 156 HIV-1-infected and 493 non-infected women from two public family planning clinics (Kenyatta National Hospital and Riruta City Clinic) in Nairobi, Kenya, who requested and met local eligibility criteria for IUD insertion.  At 1 and 4 months after insertion, information was collected from physicians--blinded as to the patient's HIV status--on IUD-related complications such as pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), removals, expulsions, and pregnancies.  Complications were identified in 11 (7.6%) HIV-positive and 37 (7.9%) HIV-negative women.  There were only 3 incident cases of PID, 2 of which occurred in HIV-infected women.  IUD removal due to pain or infection occurred in 10 (6.9%) HIV-infected and 27 (5.7%) noninfected women.  There were no differences in overall IUD complications in HIV-1-infected women by CD4 status (severely, moderately, or mildly immunocompromised).  After adjustment for marital status, study site, previous IUD use, ethnic origin, and frequency of sexual intercourse, multivariate analysis suggested no association between HIV-1 infection and increased risks for overall IUD-related complications (odds ratio (OR), 0.8; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.4-1.7) or infection-related complications (OR, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.5-2.3).  These findings suggest that the IUD may be a safe contraceptive method for appropriately selected HIV-infected women with continuing access to medical services.",IUDs do not increase the risk of complications among immunosuppressed HIV-positive women.
"What are the most effective treatments for bacterial vaginosis in nonpregnant women
Bacterial vaginosis is the most common cause of vaginal symptoms in women and has potential complications. Efforts to improve treatment of this disease process are warranted. The goal of this study was to compare the safety and efficacy of once-daily intravaginal administration of 0.75% metronidazole gel for 5 days to the established twice-daily regimen in the treatment of bacterial vaginosis. Nonpregnant women with bacterial vaginosis diagnosed by accepted clinical criteria at 14 geographically diverse general gynecology clinics were enrolled in this prospective, randomized, investigator-blind, parallel study. They were treated with either once-daily or twice-daily 0.75% metronidazole gel 5 g intravaginally for 5 days and were reevaluated at 7 to 12 days and 28 to 35 days after completing treatment. Efficacy was determined by clinical criteria. Adverse drug reactions were monitored. Of the 514 evaluable women enrolled, bacterial vaginosis was cured at the first return visit among evaluable patients in 153 of 199 (77%) of those who received the once-daily and in 157 of 196 (80%) of those who received the twice-daily administration. Bacterial vaginosis was cured among evaluable patients at the final visit in 104 of 180 (58%) of those who received once-daily and 109 of 178 (61%) of those who received the twice-daily regimen. Intent-to-treat analysis showed cure at 1 month in 118 of 207 (57%) of those treated once daily and 129 of 209 (62%) of those treated twice daily. Side effects were mild, and none caused treatment discontinuation. Once-daily dosing of 0.75% metronidazole gel 5 g for 5 days yields efficacy, safety, and tolerance equivalent to the currently used twice-daily dosing in the treatment of bacterial vaginosis, adding another competitive choice to the available therapeutic options for this condition.",Metronidazole 0.75% gel used once daily for 5 days had equal efficacy compared with twice-daily dosing (cure rate = 77% vs 80%). One study found a cure rate of 94% with oral clindamycin 300 mg twice daily for 7 days and 96% with metronidazole 500 mg twice daily for 7 days.
"What's the most effective treatment for giardiasis
Giardiasis and soil-transmitted helminthosis are prevalent in many parts of the world. Application of a single drug for treatment of both giardiasis and soil-transmitted helminthosis is highly desirable. One hundred children of both sexes, ranging from 7 to 12 years old with Giardia intestinalis cysts or trophozoites in their stool samples, were randomly separated into two groups of 50 individuals each. Each group received either mebendazole tablets 200 mg thrice daily for 5 days or metronidazole tablet 15 mg/kg/day in three divided doses, for 7 days. The results were evaluated by microscopic examination of stools on two successive occasions: 1 week and 2 weeks after treatment. Each occasion consisted of three stool examination on 3 successive days. The cure rate of mebendazole-treated children was 43 out of 50 (86 per cent), and for metronidazole it was 45 out of 50 (90 per cent) with no statistical difference between the two groups. No side-effects were observed in the mebendazole-treated group, whereas nausea, anorexia and metallic taste were observed in 4.9, 6 and 24 per cent of metronidazole-treated children, respectively. In conclusion, the use of mebendazole, which is less toxic with no side-effects, is available and effective on Giardia intestinalis as well as intestinal nematodes, is recommended especially in the areas where giardiasis and intestinal nematodiasis are prevalent and overlap.",An randomized controlled trials comparing 5 days of mebendazole with 7 days of metronidazole in 7- to 12-year-old Iranian children showed no statistical difference in microbiologic cure between the 2 regimens.
"Do glucosamine and chondroitin worsen blood sugar control in diabetes
To test the hypothesis that glucose intolerance does not occur when healthy adults consume normal, recommended dosages of glucosamine sulfate. Healthy adults (N=19) ingested 1500 mg of glucosamine sulfate or placebo (double blind) each day for 12 weeks. Three-hour oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT) were performed using 75 g of dextrose. These occurred before the start of supplementation, at 6 weeks, and at the completion of supplementation (12 weeks). There were no significant differences between fasted levels of serum insulin or blood glucose. Glucosamine sulfate supplementation did not alter serum insulin or plasma glucose during the OGTT. There were no significant differences within or between treatments, ages or gender. Glycated hemoglobin measurements at the three time points showed no significant change over time, within or between treatments, ages or gender. The lack of significant changes may have been due to large standard deviations in the data. The data suggests that glucosamine supplementation, with normal recommended dosages, does not cause glucose intolerance in healthy adults. This cannot be determined conclusively, however, until further studies are conducted using alternative types of testing.","An randomized controlled trials published in 2004 tested whether glucose intolerance occurs when healthy adults consume normal, recommended dosages of glucosamine sulfate. Nineteen healthy adults were randomized to receive either 1500 mg of glucosamine sulfate or placebo orally each day for 12 weeks. Three-hour oral glucose tolerance tests were performed using 75 g of dextrose. These occurred before the study, at 6 weeks, and at 12 weeks. There were no significant differences between fasting levels of serum insulin or blood glucose. Glucosamine sulfate supplementation did not alter serum insulin or plasma glucose during the tests. Limitations to the study include the small number of subjects, the short duration period, and the fact that the tests were performed before the patient's daily glucosamine dosing."
"What is the diagnostic approach to a patient with leg cramps
This article describes patients with nocturnal leg cramps concerning their age, medical problems, and medications, and reviews any medical evaluation performed for the complaint of nocturnal leg cramps. Provided is a retrospective chart review of 50 patients who took quinine sulfate for nocturnal leg cramps. These patients were identified through computerized pharmacy records. A control group was chosen from age-matched patients who took medications other than quinine during the study period. In a university-affiliated Veterans Administration hospital, patients with nocturnal leg cramps had a significantly higher median number of medical problems than controls. Cardiovascular diseases and neurological diseases were significantly more common in patients with nocturnal leg cramps (cases) than in those without (controls) (82% versus 64% and 36% versus 18%, respectively). The most striking differences between patients with cramps and controls were peripheral vascular disease (34% versus 12%, P = 0.09) and peripheral neurological deficit (12% versus 0%, P = 0.012). Patients with nocturnal leg cramps were prescribed significantly more medications than were controls, but no specific medication or type of medication was prescribed more frequently to patients with cramps (other than quinine). Results suggested that men with nocturnal leg cramps have greater medical comorbidity and are prescribed more medications than age-matched control patients. Unlike in previous studies, no evidence was found that specific medications, such as diuretics, betaagonists, or calcium-channel antagonists are associated with nighttime cramps. The significantly increased frequency of peripheral vascular disease and peripheral neurologic deficits in patients with nocturnal leg cramps raised the possibility that these problems contribute to the occurrence of cramps. Although the size of the study and its methodologic limitations preclude definitive conclusions, areas for research to clarify the clinical epidemiology of nocturnal leg cramps are suggested.","A small, retrospective chart review, limited to male patients, identified an association of vascular and neurologic diseases among patients taking quinine, presumably for leg cramps."
"Do calcium supplements prevent postmenopausal osteoporotic fractures
Hypovitaminosis D and a low calcium intake contribute to increased parathyroid function in elderly persons. Calcium and vitamin D supplements reduce this secondary hyperparathyroidism, but whether such supplements reduce the risk of hip fractures among elderly people is not known. We studied the effects of supplementation with vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) and calcium on the frequency of hip fractures and other nonvertebral fractures, identified radiologically, in 3270 healthy ambulatory women (mean [+/- SD] age, 84 +/- 6 years). Each day for 18 months, 1634 women received tricalcium phosphate (containing 1.2 g of elemental calcium) and 20 micrograms (800 IU) of vitamin D3, and 1636 women received a double placebo. We measured serial serum parathyroid hormone and 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations in 142 women and determined the femoral bone mineral density at base line and after 18 months in 56 women. Among the women who completed the 18-month study, the number of hip fractures was 43 percent lower (P = 0.043) and the total number of nonvertebral fractures was 32 percent lower (P = 0.015) among the women treated with vitamin D3 and calcium than among those who received placebo. The results of analyses according to active treatment and according to intention to treat were similar. In the vitamin D3-calcium group, the mean serum parathyroid hormone concentration had decreased by 44 percent from the base-line value at 18 months (P < 0.001) and the serum 25(OH)D concentration had increased by 162 percent over the base-line value (P < 0.001). The bone density of the proximal femur increased 2.7 percent in the vitamin D3-calcium group and decreased 4.6 percent in the placebo group (P < 0.001). Supplementation with vitamin D3 and calcium reduces the risk of hip fractures and other nonvertebral fractures among elderly women.","A randomized controlled trial of elderly ambulatory women showed that supplementation with 1200 mg calcium and 800 international units vitamin D per day for 18 months decreased hip fractures (RR=0.26; 95% CI, 0.03-0.44; NNT=48) and other nonvertebral fractures (RR=0.25; 95% CI, 0.09-0.38; NNT=26)."
"What is the best hypnotic for use in the elderly
Patients with insomnia may experience one or more of the following problems: difficulty falling asleep, difficulty maintaining sleep, waking up too early in the morning and nonrefreshing sleep. In addition, daytime consequences such as fatigue, lack of energy, difficulty concentrating and irritability are often present. Approximately 10 percent of adults experience persistent insomnia, although most patients do not mention it during routine office visits. Asking sleep-related questions during the general review of systems and asking patients with sleep complaints to keep a sleep diary are helpful approaches in detecting insomnia. Behavior and pharmacologic therapies are used in treating insomnia. Behavior approaches take a few weeks to improve sleep but continue to provide relief even after training sessions have ended. Hypnotic medications are safe and effective in inducing, maintaining and consolidating sleep. Effective treatment of insomnia may improve the quality of life for many patients.","Most over-the-counter sleep aids contain diphen-hydramine, a long-acting antihistamine that is considered less effective than benzodiazepines. The anticholinergic properties of antihistamines can result in cognitive changes and urinary retention in the elderly"
"What is the best treatment for pertussis
Although universal immunization against Bordetella pertussis (whooping cough) infection has resulted in dramatic reductions in the incidence of pertussis, outbreaks continue to occur in countries with excellent vaccine coverage. Treatment of infection may ameliorate symptom severity during the catarrhal phase of pertussis but has no effect on established paroxysms, emesis, or apnea if given during the paroxysmal or convalescent phases. Erythromycin, recommended for treatment of pertussis to prevent transmission of infection, is poorly tolerated because of gastrointestinal side effects. We compared the safety and efficacy of erythromycin with azithromycin for treatment of pertussis in a large, randomized, controlled trial that enrolled children from primary care practices in 1 American and 11 Canadian urban centers. Children who were 6 months to 16 years of age and had cough illness that was suspected to be or was culture confirmed as pertussis were randomized to azithromycin (10 mg/kg on day 1 and 5 mg/kg on days 2-5 as a single dose) or erythromycin estolate (40 mg/kg/day in 3 divided doses for 10 days) with stratification by center. The primary outcome measure was bacteriologic cure of infection as determined by cultures of nasopharyngeal aspirates. Culture-positive participants had a second aspirate collected at the end of therapy (days 5-7 for azithromycin, days 10-12 for erythromycin) and 1 week after therapy. Bacteriologic cure was defined as negative cultures at the end of therapy. Bacteriologic relapse was defined as a positive culture 1 week after completion of therapy and after a negative end-of-therapy culture. Secondary outcomes were pertussis diagnosed by serology and polymerase chain reaction (PCR), treatment-associated adverse events, compliance, and presence of clinical symptoms at the end of the treatment course. Serology was performed using standard enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay methods. A participant was considered to have pertussis when the PCR was positive or a 4-fold increase in pertussis toxin antibody between baseline and follow-up visits was observed. PCR was performed using a 1046-bp ClaI DNA fragment from B pertussis. Adverse events (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, any gastrointestinal complaint, or other) were determined by a parent-completed diary that was reviewed with study personnel during study visits. Compliance was measured by review of the parent medication diary during study visits and observation of medication containers by the pharmacist at study completion. Symptoms were determined by history collected by study personnel at enrollment and subsequently from the diary. The design of the study was an equivalence trial, aimed at demonstrating that the bacteriologic failure rates with the 2 therapies did not differ by >8%. For the safety analysis, all participants who received at least 1 dose of study drug were included. In the per-protocol efficacy analysis, all culture-positive participants with end-of-treatment cultures were considered. A total of 477 children were enrolled and randomly assigned to either azithromycin (n = 239) or erythromycin (n = 238). Of these children, 114 (24%) grew B pertussis from nasopharyngeal specimens (azithromycin group: 58 of 239 [24%]; erythromycin group: 56 of 238 [23%]); these children composed the efficacy cohort for the per-protocol and intention-to-treat analyses. Serology and PCR added 52 children to the number considered to have pertussis for a total of 35% (166 of 477) of all children who presented with cough illness. In the safety analysis (antibiotic side effects, compliance) and comparison of cough symptoms after treatment, all randomized children are reported in their assigned treatment group. At end of therapy, bacterial eradication was demonstrated in all 53 patients in the azithromycin group and all 53 patients in the erythromycin group with follow-up cultures available (eradication 100%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 93.3-100). No bacterial recurrence was demonstrated in children with 1 week posttreatment nasopharyngeal cultures available (51 and 53 participants in the azithromycin and erythromycin arms, respectively [0%, 95% CI: 0-7.0; and 0%, 95% CI: 0-6.7]). No serious adverse events attributable to study drug were observed. Gastrointestinal adverse events were reported less frequently in azithromycin (18.8%; 45 of 239) than in erythromycin estolate (41.2%; 98 of 238) recipients (90% CI on difference: -29.0% to -15.7%) as a result of less nausea (2.9% vs 8.4%; 95% CI: -8.9% to -2.0%), less vomiting (5.0% vs 13.0%; 95% CI: -4.9% to -1.4%), and less diarrhea (7.1% vs 11.8%; 95% CI: -9.0% to -0.3%). Children who were randomized to azithromycin were much more likely to have complied with antimicrobial therapy over the treatment period. In the azithromycin group, 90% of children took 100% of prescribed doses, whereas only 55% of children in the erythromycin group took 100% of prescribed doses. In this large, multicenter, randomized trial, we found that azithromycin is as effective as erythromycin estolate for the treatment of pertussis in children. Gastrointestinal adverse events were much more common with erythromycin treatment than azithromycin. Compliance with therapy was markedly better with azithromycin than with erythromycin in this study.","A large, multicenter randomized controlled trials of 477 children of 6 months to 16 years of age demonstrated that a 5-day treatment with azithromycin eradicated B pertussis from the nasopharynx as effectively as a 10-day course of erythromycin estolate. Similarly, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole proved as effective as erythromycin in eliminating B pertussis from the nasopharynx."
"When are empiric antibiotics appropriate for urinary tract infection symptoms
Although urinary tract infections (UTIs) in otherwise healthy ambulatory women are often managed over the telephone, there has been no systematic evaluation of this approach. Our objective was to compare the outcomes of uncomplicated UTIs in healthy women managed over the telephone with those managed in the office. We randomly assigned women calling their usual provider with a suspected UTI to receive care over the telephone (n=36) or usual office-based care (n=36). All women had urinalyses and urine cultures. All were treated with 7 days of antibiotics. We compared symptom scores at baseline and at day 3 and day 10 after therapy. We also compared patient satisfaction at the end of the study. The settings were family practices in Michigan. We included healthy nonpregnant women older than 18 years. A total of 201 women with suspected UTIs called their physician. Of these, 99 were ineligible, and 30 declined to participate. The women were young (mean age=36.6 years) and predominantly white (86%). Sixty-four percent of the urine cultures had significant growth of a single organism. We observed no difference in symptom scores or satisfaction. Overall, satisfaction was high. Short-term outcomes of managing suspected UTIs by telephone appear to be comparable with usual office care.",No increase in adverse outcomes was seen in another study of a telephone treatment protocol.
"How does tissue adhesive compare with suturing for superficial lacerations
Tissue adhesives have been used for many years to close simple lacerations as an alternative to standard wound closure (sutures, staples, adhesive strips). They offer many potential advantages over standard wound closure, including ease of use, decrease in pain and time to apply, as well as not requiring a follow-up visit for removal. Many studies have compared tissue adhesives and standard wound closure to determine the cosmetic outcome as well as these other secondary outcomes in their respective study populations. However, due to the wide variation in study parameters, there are no generalisable, definitive answers about the effectiveness of tissue adhesives. No study has been adequately powered to assess differences in complications, which are rare. To summarize the best available evidence for the effect of tissue adhesives in the management of traumatic lacerations in children and adults. We searched the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (CD ROM 2001 Issue 4), the Cochrane Wounds Group Specialized Trials Register (Nov 2001), MEDLINE (1966 to Oct 1, 2001), and EMBASE (1988 to Sept 1, 2001) for relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We also searched the citations of selected studies, and we contacted relevant authors and manufacturers of tissue adhesives to inquire about other published and unpublished trials. We included RCTs comparing tissue adhesives versus standard wound closure or tissue adhesive versus tissue adhesive for acute, linear, low tension, traumatic lacerations in an emergency or primary care setting. Trials evaluating tissue adhesives for surgical incisions or other types of wounds were not considered. Data from eligible studies were extracted by one reviewer and checked for accuracy by a second reviewer. Two reviewers independently assessed masked copies for quality. Outcomes of cosmesis (subgroups of age, wound location and need for deep sutures), pain, procedure time, ease of use and complications were analysed separately for two comparisons: 1) tissue adhesive versus standard wound care; and 2) tissue adhesive versus tissue adhesive. Eight studies compared a tissue adhesive with standard wound care. No significant difference was found for cosmesis at any of the time points examined, using either Cosmetic Visual Analogue Scale (CVAS) or Wound Evaluation Score (WES). Data were only available for subgroup analysis for age; no significant differences were found. Pain scores (Parent VAS WMD -15.7 mm; 95% CI -21.9, -9.5) and procedure time (WMD -5.6 minutes; 95% CI -8.2, -3.1) significantly favoured tissue adhesives. No studies reported on ease of use. Small but statistically significant risk differences were found for dehiscence (favouring standard wound care NNH 25 95% CI 14, 100) and erythema (favouring tissue adhesive NNH 8 95% CI 4, 100). Other complications were not significantly different between treatment groups. Only one study was identified that compared two tissue adhesives (butylcyanoacrylate (Histoacryl TM) versus octylcyanoacrylate (Dermabond TM)) for pediatric facial lacerations. No significant difference was found for cosmesis using CVAS at 1-3 months, or using WES at 5-14 days and 1-3 months. Similarly, no significant difference was found in pain, procedure time or complications. Results for ease of use were incomplete as reported. Tissue adhesives are an acceptable alternative to standard wound closure for repairing simple traumatic lacerations. There is no significant difference in cosmetic outcome between tissue adhesives and standard wound closure, or between different tissue adhesives. They offer the benefit of decreased procedure time and less pain, compared to standard wound closure. A small but statistically significant increased rate of dehiscence with tissue adhesives must be considered when choosing the closure method (NNH 25).","A Cochrane review found 10 studies, which included 970 patients in the emergency-room setting. Review of these articles found no significant difference in cosmetic appearance between tissue adhesive closure and standard suture closure with a 3-month follow-up period in acute, linear wounds under low tension. Wound erythema (number needed to treat [NNT]=10) and dehiscence rates (NNT=25) were lower for tissue adhesives. In the 6 studies that reported time data, treatment with tissue adhesive took 4.7 fewer minutes. In all 6 studies that reported patients' perception of pain, pain was significantly less with tissue adhesive (weighted mean difference=13.7 mm [on 100-mm scale]; 95% confidence interval [CI], -20.0 to -6.9)."
"Does physical therapy improve symptoms of fibromyalgia
Non-malignant musculoskeletal pain is an increasing problem in western countries. Fibromyalgia syndrome is an increasing recognised chronic musculoskeletal disorder. The objective of this systematic review was to determine the effectiveness of multidisciplinary rehabilitation for fibromyalgia and widespread musculoskeletal pain among working age adults. An electronic search was conducted and included Medline from 1966, PsycLIT from 1967 and EMBASE from 1980 to April 1998. The Cochrane Musculoskeletal Group Trials Register was searched as well as, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (CCTR). The references of identified articles and reviews were checked, studies published in the Finnish medical database Medic from 1978 to 1998 screened and the Science Citation Index searched. Content experts were also contacted for additional or unpublished studies. From all references found in our original search, we selected all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and clinical controlled trials (CCTs). Trials had to assess the effectiveness of multidisciplinary rehabilitation for patients suffering from fibromyalgia and widespread musculoskeletal pain among working age adults. The rehabilitation program was required to be multidisciplinary; that is, it had to consist of a physician's consultation, plus a psychological, social or vocational intervention, or a combination of both. Four reviewers independently selected the RCTs and CCTs that met the specified inclusion criteria. Two experts in the field of rehabilitation evaluated the relevance and applicability of the findings of the selected studies to actual clinical use. Two other reviewers extracted the data and assessed the main results and the methodological quality of the studies using standardized forms. Finally, a qualitative analysis was performed to evaluate the level of scientific evidence for the effectiveness of multidisciplinary rehabilitation. After screening 1808 abstracts, and the references of 65 reviews, we found only seven relevant studies (1050 patients) that met our inclusion criteria. None of these were considered, methodologically, a high quality randomized controlled trial. Four of the included RCTs on fibromyalgia were graded low quality and suggest no quantifiable benefits. The three included RCTs on widespread musculoskeletal pain showed that based on limited evidence, overall, no evidence of efficacy was observed. However, behavioral treatment and stress management appear to be important components. Education combined with physical training showed some positive effects in long term follow up. We conclude that there appears to be little scientific evidence for the effectiveness of multidisciplinary rehabilitation for these musculoskeletal disorders. However, multidisciplinary rehabilitation is a commonly used intervention for chronic musculoskeletal disorders, which cause much personal suffering and substantial economic loss to the society. There is a need for high quality trials in this field.","In a systematic review of 7 studies fulfilling inclusion criteria (a total of 1050 patients), Karjalainen and colleagues concluded that although education combined with physical training seemed to have some positive results at long-term follow-up, the level of scientific evidence required for recommending these programs for fibromyalgia was lacking."
"Which infants need lumbar puncture for suspected sepsis
Fever may be the sole clinically evident presentation of serious bacterial infection (SBI) in a very young infant, and therefore lumbar puncture is still widely regarded as a mandatory procedure in the sepsis workup of febrile infants under 2 months of age. In this retrospective study, we evaluated the frequency and the diagnostic value of cerebrospinal fluid examination in 492 infants aged less than 3 months who were hospitalized because of fever during 1988-1994. The patients were categorized as being at ""high risk"" or ""low risk"" for SBI according to current clinical and laboratory criteria. Among the 492 infants, 196 (40%) were identified as ""high-risk"" for SBI, and 296 (60%) were at low risk. Among the overall series of infants, 60 babies (12%) were subsequently proven with bacterial infection. Among the 196 ""high-risk"" babies, 26% had bacterial infection, compared to only 3% of the 296 infants at low risk (p < 0.0001), denoting a sensitivity of 85% and a specificity of 65% of the clinical classification criteria. Lumbar puncture was done to 186 (46%) infants upon hospital admission; 176 punctures yielded satisfactory samples of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Sixteen (3%) patients had abnormal CSF findings: 2 of them had positive bacterial cultures and 14 were compatible with aseptic meningitis. The 2 patients with purulent meningitis were clinically very ill and were immediately recognized as deserving a lumbar puncture. Of the 14 patients with aseptic meningitis, 13 were initially screened as being at high risk for serious infection, and therefore underwent a lumbar puncture. Over the years of this survey, a declining trend for performing lumbar puncture in ""low-risk"" young febrile infants became evident: during 1988-1992, evaluation of sepsis included a lumbar puncture in 45% of the infants, compared to 27% during the following 2 years (p < 0.0001). Not one instance of purulent meningitis evolved among the infants in whom lumbar puncture was not performed. Our observations suggest that hospitalized young febrile infants may safely be spared a lumbar puncture when they do not meet the proposed criteria for being at high risk, or when their clinical and laboratory picture suggests being at low risk for SBI.","A retrospective chart review of 492 infants aged <3 months who were hospitalized due to fever included 108 infants aged <1 month. Thirty percent (114) of the infants aged 1 to 3 months and 67% (72) of the younger infants underwent lumbar puncture at the discretion of the treating physician. All infants were retrospectively assigned to low- or high-risk groups for serious bacterial infection using the Rochester criteria. Of the 296 infants rated ""low-risk"", none developed bacterial meningitis. Ten of these infants subsequently developed evidence of another bacterial focus (predominantly urinary tract infection)."
"When should you consider implanted nerve stimulators for lower back pain
The purpose of this report was to examine the available literature to determine the safety and efficacy of spinal cord stimulation (SCS) for the treatment of chronic pain of the trunk and limbs. The author identified 68 studies that fulfilled the efficacy inclusion/exclusion criteria, grouped on the basis of pain indication, with an overall population of 3679 patients. Fifty-one studies fulfilled all safety inclusion/exclusion criteria. Based on the literature review, the author found that SCS had a positive, symptomatic, long-term effect in cases of refractory angina pain, severe ischemic limb pain secondary to peripheral vascular disease, peripheral neuropathic pain, and chronic low-back pain, and that, in general, SCS was a safe and effective treatment for a variety of chronic neuropathic conditions. Despite the positive findings, there is an urgent need for randomized, controlled, long-term studies on the efficacy of SCS involving larger patient sample sizes.","A 2004 systematic review of SCS for all indications included 51 studies and 2973 patients. Sixteen of the studies, with a total of 616 patients, focused on low back pain, specifically chronic back pain and failed back surgery syndrome. Two of the 16 studies were prospective controlled trials, 8 were prospective trials without controls, and 6 were retrospective studies. Both prospective, controlled trials (total of 62 patients) demonstrated statistically significant (P<.05) results with SCS. One measured subjective pain and the other used crossover to the other treatment arm (SCS vs surgery) as a marker for treatment failure."
"Should patients receive 23-valent pneumococcal vaccination more than once
To determine pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine efficacy in selected populations at risk for serious pneumococcal infection for whom vaccination is currently recommended and to assess duration of protection after vaccination. Vaccine efficacy was estimated using indirect cohort analysis to compare the proportion of pneumococcal infections caused by serotypes included in the vaccines of vaccinated and unvaccinated persons who were identified during 14 years of national surveillance. Hospital laboratories in the United States that submitted pneumococcal isolates to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention between May 1978 and April 1992. A total of 2837 persons older than 5 years who had pneumococcus isolated from blood or cerebrospinal fluid. Overall efficacy for preventing infection caused by serotypes included in the vaccine was 57% (95% confidence interval [CI], 45% to 66%). Efficacy among persons with diabetes mellitus was 84% (95% CI, 50% to 95%); with coronary vascular disease, 73% (95% CI, 23% to 90%); with congestive heart failure, 69% (95% CI, 17% to 88%); with chronic pulmonary diseases, 65% (95% CI, 26% to 83%); and with anatomic asplenia, 77% (95% CI, 14% to 95%). Efficacy was not documented for patients with alcoholism or cirrhosis, sickle cell disease, chronic renal failure, lymphoma, leukemia, or multiple myeloma, although sample sizes were small for these groups. Efficacy for immunocompetent persons older than 65 years was 75% (95% CI, 57% to 85%). Efficacy did not decline with increasing interval after vaccination: 5 to 8 years after vaccination it was 71% (95% CI, 24% to 89%), and 9 years or more after vaccination it was 80% (95% CI, 16% to 95%). Intensified efforts to improve pneumococcal vaccine coverage among certain populations for whom vaccination is currently recommended is indicated, but universal revaccination is not warranted at this time.",A study of pneumococcal strains cultured from hospitalized patients demonstrated a duration of protection against pneumococcal infection that was much longer than that predicted by the shorter duration of antibody levels. The vaccine's ability to reduce infection (due to serotypes included in the vaccine) lasted for at least 9 years and overall efficacy for preventing infection caused by the serotypes included in the vaccine was 57%.
"How can you help prevent a recurrence of diverticulitis
Diverticula (mucosal outpouching through the wall of the colon) affect over 5% of adults aged 40 years and older, but only 10-25% of affected people will develop symptoms such as lower abdominal pain. Recurrent symptoms are common, and 5% of people with diverticula eventually develop complications such as perforation, obstruction, haemorrhage, fistulae, or abscesses. METHODS AND OUTCOMES: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of: treatments for uncomplicated diverticular disease; treatments to prevent complications; and treatments for acute diverticulitis? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to July 2006 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). We found 13 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions. In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: antispasmodics, bran, elective surgery, increasing fibre intake, ispaghula husk, lactulose, medical treatment, mesalazine, methylcellulose, rifaximin, surgery.","A 2007 systematic review found 1 randomized controlled trials of the anti-inflammatory drug mesalamine (mesalazine, 5-aminosalicylic acid) for preventing diverticulitis. Mesalamine reduced the recurrence rate of diverticulitis from 46% to 15% among 166 subjects. The reviewers judged the study to be flawed by unreported diagnostic criteria and a high withdrawal rate. They concluded that the effectiveness of mesalamine remains unknown."
"Angiotensin blockade for diabetes: Monitor microalbuminuria
The progression of nephropathy from diagnosis of type 2 diabetes has not been well described from a single population. This study sought to describe the development and progression through the stages of microalbuminuria, macroalbuminuria, persistently elevated plasma creatinine or renal replacement therapy (RRT), and death. Using observed and modeled data from 5097 subjects in the UK Prospective Diabetes Study, we measured the annual probability of transition from stage to stage (incidence), prevalence, cumulative incidence, ten-year survival, median duration per stage, and risk of death from all-causes or cardiovascular disease. From diagnosis of diabetes, progression to microalbuminuria occurred at 2.0% per year, from microalbuminuria to macroalbuminuria at 2.8% per year, and from macroalbuminuria to elevated plasma creatinine (>or=175 micromol/L) or renal replacement therapy at 2.3% per year. Ten years following diagnosis of diabetes, the prevalence of microalbuminuria was 24.9%, of macroalbuminuria was 5.3%, and of elevated plasma creatinine or RRT was 0.8%. Patients with elevated plasma creatinine or RRT had an annual death rate of 19.2% (95% confidence interval, CI, 14.0 to 24.4%). There was a trend for increasing risk of cardiovascular death with increasing nephropathy (P < 0.0001), with an annual rate of 0.7% for subjects in the stage of no nephropathy, 2.0% for those with microalbuminuria, 3.5% for those with macroalbuminuria, and 12.1% with elevated plasma creatinine or RRT. Individuals with macroalbuminuria were more likely to die in any year than to develop renal failure. The proportion of patients with type 2 diabetes who develop microalbuminuria is substantial with one quarter affected by 10 years from diagnosis. Relatively fewer patients develop macroalbuminuria, but in those who do, the death rate exceeds the rate of progression to worse nephropathy.",One study that followed 5097 patients with type 2 diabetes over a median of 10.4 years found that 2% of patients progressed from normal levels of urinary protein to microalbuminuria; 2.8% changed from microalbuminuria to macroalbuminuria (urine albumin >300 mg in a 24-hour period); and 2.3% progressed to chronic renal disease (creatinine ≥2 mg/dL) from macroalbuminuria per year. Chronic renal disease is more likely to occur in those patients whose hypertension or hyperglycemia is poorly controlled.
"Are DMARDs effective for rheumatologic diseases besides rheumatoid arthritis
To assess the effects of salazopyrin, auranofin, etretinate, fumaric acid, IMI gold, azathioprine, efamol marine and methotrexate, in psoriatic arthritis. We searched Medline up to February 2000, and Excerpta Medica (June 1974-95). Search terms were psoriasis, arthritis, therapy and/or controlled trial. This was supplemented by manually searching bibliographies of previously published reviews, conference proceedings, contacting drug companies and referring to the Cochrane Clinical Trials Register. All languages were included in the initial search. All randomized trials comparing salazopyrin, auranofin, etretinate, fumaric acid, IMI gold, azathioprine, and methotrexate, in psoriatic arthritis. Following a published a priori protocol, the main outcome measures included individual component variables derived from Outcome Measures in Rheumatology Clinical Trials (OMERACT). These include acute phase reactants, disability, pain, patient global assessment, physician global assessment, swollen joint count, tender joint count and radiographic changes of joints in any trial of one year or longer [Tugwell 1993], and the change in pooled disease index (DI). Only English trials were included in the review. Data were independently extracted from the published reports by two of the reviewers (MC, GJ). An independent blinded quality assessment was also performed. Twenty randomized trials were identified of which thirteen were included in the quantitative analysis with data from 1022 subjects. Although all agents were better than placebo, parenteral high dose methotrexate (not included), salazopyrin, azathioprine and etretinate were the agents that achieved statistical significance in a global index of disease activity (although it should be noted that only one component variable was available for azathioprine and only one trial was available for etretinate suggesting some caution is necessary in interpreting these results). Analysis of response in individual disease activity markers was more variable with considerable differences between different medications and responses. In all trials the placebo group improved over baseline (pooled improvement 0.39 DI units, 95% CI 0.26-0.54). There was insufficient data to examine toxicity. Parenteral high dose methotrexate and salazopyrin are the only two agents with well demonstrated published efficacy in psoriatic arthritis. The magnitude of the effect seen with azathioprine, etretinate, oral low dose methotrexate and perhaps colchicine suggests that they may be effective but that further multicentre clinical trials are required to establish their efficacy. Furthermore, the magnitude of the improvement observed in the placebo group strongly suggests that uncontrolled trials should not be used to guide management decisions in this condition.","A Cochrane systematic review identified 13 randomized controlled trials enrolling a combined 1022 patients with psoriatic arthritis randomly assigned to receive a DMARD-methotrexate, sulfasalazine (Azulfidine), azathioprine (Imuran/ Azasan), or etretinate (Tegison; no longer available in the US)-compared with placebo. All agents were better than placebo; however, only 2 agents (parenteral high-dose methotrexate and sulfasalazine) had clinically important benefits for more than half the patients. The studies were too small to establish toxicity or to evaluate the other agents."
"Can you differentiate bacterial from viral pediatric infections based on the CBC
To determine the diagnostic properties of quantitative C-reactive protein (CRP) associated with clinically undetectable serious bacterial infection (SBI) in febrile children 1 to 36 months of age. Febrile children presenting to a pediatric emergency department (ED) with ages ranging from 1 to 36 months, temperatures > or =39 degrees C, and clinically undetectable source of fever were enrolled in this prospective cohort study. Demographic information, ED temperature, duration of fever, and clinical evaluation using the Yale observation scale were recorded at the time of the initial evaluation. The white blood cell count (WBC), band count, absolute neutrophil count (ANC), and CRP concentration were measured at the same time. All patients received blood cultures and either a screening urinalysis or urine culture. A chest radiograph was obtained at the discretion of the ED physician. Patients with history of using antibiotics within 1 week of their presentation to the ED were excluded. The main outcome result was the presence of laboratory or radiographically proven SBI (bacteremia, meningitis, urinary tract infection, pneumonia, septic arthritis, and osteomyelitis). Seventy-seven patients were enrolled in the study. Fourteen (18%) had a SBI (6 urinary tract infection; 4 pneumonia, including 1 patient with Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteremia; and 4 occult S pneumoniae bacteremia), and 63 had no SBI. The 2 groups were indistinguishable in age, sex, ED temperature, duration of fever, and Yale observation scale. CRP concentration, WBC, and ANC were significantly different between the 2 groups. In a multivariate logistic regression analysis, only CRP remained as a predictor of SBI (Beta = 0.76, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.64, 0.89). Receiver-operating characteristic analysis demonstrated CRP (area under curve [AUC] 0.905, standard error [SE] 0.05, 95% CI: 0.808, 1.002) to be superior to ANC (AUC 0.805, SE 0.051, 95% CI: 0.705, 0.905) and to WBC (AUC 0.761, SE 0.068, 95% CI: 0.628, 0.895). A CRP cutoff point of 7 was determined to maximize both sensitivity and specificity (sensitivity 79%, specificity 91%, likelihood ratio 8.3, 95% CI: 3.8, 27.3). Multilevel likelihood ratios and posttest probabilities were calculated for a variety of CRP levels. A CRP concentration of <5 mg/dL effectively ruled out SBI (likelihood ratio 0.087, 95% CI: 0.02, 0.38, posttest probability of SBI 1.9%). Quantitative CRP concentration is a valuable laboratory test in the evaluation of febrile young children who are at risk for occult bacteremia and SBI, with a better predictive value than the WBC or ANC.","A lower prevalence reduces the utility of routine CBC or blood culture in the evaluation of immunized, febrile children. Parameters such as procalcitonin, interleukin-6, interleukin-8, interleukin-1 receptor antagonist and C-reactive protein show future promise as biochemical markers for identifying serious bacterial infections."
"Does combining aspirin and warfarin decrease the risk of stroke for patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation
Adjusted-dose warfarin is effective for stroke prevention in patients with nonrheumatic atrial fibrillation (AF), but the risk of bleeding is high, especially among the elderly. Fixed minidose warfarin is effective in preventing venous thromboembolism with low risk of bleeding and no need for frequent clinical monitoring. Patients > 60 years with nonrheumatic AF were randomized in an open-labeled trial to receive fixed minidose warfarin (1.25 mg/day) or standard adjusted-dose warfarin (International Normalized Ratio [INR] between 2.0 and 3.0). Primary outcome events were ischemic stroke, peripheral or visceral embolism, cerebral or fatal bleeding, and vascular death. Secondary end points were major bleeding, myocardial infarction, and death. This study was discontinued before completion in light of publication of the Stroke Prevention in Atrial Fibrillation III trial, which indicated that low-intensity fixed-dose warfarin treatment (i.e., INR < 1.5) was insufficient for stroke prevention in high-risk patients with nonrheumatic AF. From a total of 1,209 considered patients, 303 were randomized to be studied (150 in the minidose group and 153 in the adjusted-dose group). Mean follow-up was 14.5 months. The rate of cumulative primary events was 11.1% (95% confidence intervals [CI] 4.0 to 18.2) in the fixed minidose group and 6.1% (95% CI 1.1 to 11.1) in the adjusted-dose group (p = 0.29). The rate of ischemic stroke was significantly higher in the minidose group (3.7% vs 0% per year, p = 0.025). Major bleedings were more frequent in standard treatment group (2.6% vs 1% per year, p = 0.19). Most thromboembolic complications occurred at INRs < 1.2, whereas the majority of hemorrhages occurred at INRs > 3.0. No significant difference in primary outcome events was observed in the abbreviated study. However, the significantly increased occurrence of ischemic stroke in the fixed minidose warfarin group suggests that this regimen does not protect patients with nonrheumatic AF.","Pengo et al randomized patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation aged >60 years to fixed-dose (1.25 mg/d) or adjusted-dose warfarin (INR=2.0-3.0) to evaluate ischemic stroke rates and major bleeding. This trial enrolled 303 patients who were followed up for 14.5 months before discontinuation of the trial. The rate of ischemic stroke was significantly higher in the fixed-dose warfarin group compared with the adjusted warfarin group (3.7% vs 0% per year; NNT=27). Major bleeds were more frequent in the adjusted warfarin group (2.6% vs 1% per year, number needed to harm=63). While the combined primary endpoint did not show a significant benefit for adjusted-dose warfarin, this study suggests that fixed-dose warfarin does not protect against ischemic stroke in non-valvular atrial fibrillation patients."
"What are the causes of elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone in a newborn
The Dutch T(4)-TSH-TBG-based neonatal screening program detects patients with congenital hypothyroidism (CH) of thyroidal (CH-T) as well as central (CH-C) origin. The numbers and characteristics of true-positive and false-positive referrals will differ from other, predominantly TSH-based, screening methods. The present study describes the characteristics of the referred neonates, both CH patients and false positives, and of the reported CH patients with a false-negative screening result born in the study period. DESIGN, SETTING, PATIENTS, AND MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: For each referred child born between April 1, 2002, and May 31, 2004, screening results and first venous sample results were recorded and classified as transient or permanent CH-T or CH-C or as no CH. In the study period, 430,764 children were screened. Of the 772 children with abnormal screening results, 224 (29%) had CH; another 13 CH patients did not have abnormal screening results, giving an overall CH incidence of 1:1800. Incidences of permanent CH, permanent CH-T, permanent CH-C, and transient CH were 1:2200, 1:2500, 1:21,000, and 1:12,000, respectively. The most frequent explanations for the 548 false-positive referrals (71% of the referred cohort) were severe illness and TBG deficiency (occurring in 198 and 200 children, respectively). The Dutch incidence figures for CH belong to the highest worldwide, suggesting that the T(4)-TSH-TBG screening program is an efficient method to detect CH of variable etiology and severity. Still, a small percentage of children with CH escaped detection via this screening approach. Severe illness and TBG deficiency appear to be responsible for the majority of false-positive referrals.","A study from the Netherlands examined diagnoses of infants with an increased thyroid-stimulating hormone on newborn screening heelstick. Of 112 newborns with a thyroid-stimulating hormone >50 mU/L, 110 (98%) had congenital hypothyroidism on further examination. However, only 34 of 594 (5.7%) newborns with a thyroid-stimulating hormone between 9 and 20 mU/L were diagnosed with congenital hypothyroidism. Nineteen of 46 newborns (41%) with levels between 20 and 50 mU/L had congenital hypothyroidism."
"How should we follow up a positive screen for anemia in a 1-year old
Children found to be anemic on routine screening by HemoCue, a rapid and relatively inexpensive method of screening for hemoglobin (Hb), are often prescribed iron as a diagnostic tool and potential treatment for presumed iron deficiency anemia (IDA). We questioned this approach given the declining prevalence of IDA and the concomitant relative increase in other causes of anemia. To evaluate the practice of Hb screening for IDA by determining the prevalence of anemia by HemoCue; the proportion of anemic patients treated with iron and followed up; the frequency of repeated Hb testing, additional iron studies, and iron prescriptions; and the 6-month outcomes of treated and untreated anemia. Retrospective cohort study. Of 1358 children aged 9 to 36 months who underwent screening, 343 (25%) had anemia, defined as a Hb level of less than 110 g/L. Outpatient medical records of 334 of the anemic children revealed that 239 (72%) were prescribed iron while 95 (28%) were not prescribed iron at the first visit for anemia. Anemia follow-up rates were low for the prescribed and not prescribed groups: 7% vs 5% returned within 1 month, while 37% vs 42% did not return within 6 months for follow-up. Of the children who were prescribed iron, 107 (71%) of 150 responded to treatment or anemia resolved within 6 months compared with 27 (68%) of 40 not prescribed iron. Children underwent repeated blood testing for measurement of Hb and complete blood cell count, but underwent few iron-specific studies. Routine screening for IDA by HemoCue followed by a therapeutic trial of iron was problematic because of a high rate of anemia in this predominantly African American population, low follow-up rates, and a high spontaneous resolution rate. Prospective studies are needed to evaluate other screening methods to differentiate IDA from other forms of anemia and to improve compliance and outcome in inner-city children.","In a retrospective cohort study of 1358 innercity children aged 9 to 36 months who underwent screening, 343 (25%) had anemia (Hgb <11 g/dL); of these, 239 (72%) were prescribed iron and 95 (28%) were not. Responders were defined as those with a hemoglobin value of greater than 11 g/dL or an increase of 1 g/dL documented within 6 months of the initial screening visit. Follow-up rates for both groups were low (~50%), but of those prescribed iron, 107 of 150 (71%) responded to treatment compared with 27 of 48 (68%) of those who did not receive iron. Since similar response rates were seen among infants who did and infants who did not receive iron therapy, proving the benefit of routine screening followed by a trial of iron may be problematic in populations with higher rates of anemia, low follow-up rates, and high spontaneous resolution rates."
"Are liver function tests required for patients taking isoniazid for latent tuberculosis
Isoniazid chemoprophylaxis has long been known to be a highly effective means of preventing silent tuberculous infections from spreading to active disease. There has been much controversy, however, about the risk it carries for fatal hepatotoxicity. In this article I review the rate of fatal isoniazid-induced hepatitis during chemoprophylaxis that is done according to current monitoring guidelines. Information was obtained from a MEDLINE literature search and a survey of tuberculosis control officers in large metropolitan areas throughout the country. Data were included of patients who were monitored according to the American Thoracic Society's guidelines or who were treated after 1983 when the guidelines were published. The pooled results of the published studies showed no hepatotoxic deaths in 20,212 patients in whom prophylaxis was started. The unpublished data showed 2 deaths in 182,285 patients, for a combined rate of 0.001% (2 of 202,497). The death rate for those older than 35 years was estimated to be 0.002% (1 of 43,334). This rate is significantly lower than was previously estimated and should be used to reevaluate the benefit of preventive therapy for tuberculin-reactive patients older than 35. The risk of fatal isoniazid-induced hepatitis is negligible for all ages when patients are routinely monitored for liver toxicity.","A pooled analysis of more than 200,000 patients receiving isoniazid prophylaxis and monitored according to 1983 American Thoracic Society guidelines reported an intermediate hepatitis rate (1.2%) and only 2 deaths. Mortality from isoniazid hepatitis is rare, whichever monitoring strategy is selected. Some deaths attributed to isoniazid prophylaxis may also have had other contributing causes, such as unrecognized hepatitis C; most cases and deaths reported in these large series occurred before testing for hepatitis C became available in 1991."
"What is the recommended approach to asymptomatic patients who develop a reactive PPD
A major difficulty associated with the use of standard therapy with isoniazid for latent tuberculosis infection is poor patient adherence to therapy because of the prolonged course required. Shorter courses of therapy involving > or =2 drugs have been proposed as an alternative to standard therapy, but they have not undergone enough testing. We performed a meta-analysis to determine the equivalence of daily short-course therapy with rifampin plus isoniazid for 3 months and standard therapy with isoniazid for 6-12 months. The end points that were evaluated were development of active tuberculosis, severe adverse drug reactions, and death. We searched published information in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, and Embase databases, as well as unpublished information in the Cambridge Scientific Abstracts Internet database, Conference Papers Index, AIDS and Cancer Research Abstracts, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also scanned the reference lists of articles. We only included trials in which individuals were randomly allocated to receive treatment. Two reviewers independently applied the criteria for trial selection, assessed trial quality, and extracted data. Five trials comprising 1926 adults from Hong Kong, Spain, and Uganda were identified. The mean duration of follow-up varied from 13 to 37 months. Overall, development of active tuberculosis was equivalent in association with both regimens (pooled risk difference, 0%; 95% confidence interval [CI], -1% to 2%; percentage of total variation across the studies that is the result of heterogeneity rather than chance [I2], 0%; P=.86). Severe adverse effects were reported with a similar frequency for both regimens (pooled risk difference, -1%; 95% CI, -7% to 5%) but with statistically significant heterogeneity detected (I2, 78%; P=.001). However, a subanalysis of high-quality trials (including 74% of the sample size) suggested that both regimens were equally safe. In 3 trials (comprising 1390 patients) that provided data on mortality, the regimens showed equivalence (pooled risk difference, -1%; 95% CI, -4% to 2%; I2, 2.7%; P=.38). Short-course therapy with rifampin plus isoniazid was equivalent to standard therapy with isoniazid in terms of efficacy, the proportion of severe side effects that occurred, and mortality.","INH monotherapy was compared with combination INH and rifampin in a 2005 meta-analysis of 5 RCTs of variable quality involving 1926 patients. This meta-analysis found equivalency in risk of active tuberculosis and mortality between INH monotherapy for 6 to 12 months and the combination of rifampin and INH for 3 months pooled risk difference=0%; 95% confidence interval [CI], -1% to 2%. This study also showed similar rates of adverse events in both groups pooled risk difference=-1%; 95% CI, -7% to 5%. Short-course combination rifampin and pyrazinamide is no longer recommended after an open-label randomized controlled trials with 589 patients demonstrated severe hepatoxicity in 7.7% 16/207 on a 2-month course of pyrazinamide and rifampin, compared with 1% 2/204 on 6 months of INH RR=7.9, number needed to harm=15."
"What are contraindications to IUDs
The intrauterine contraceptive device (IUD) is highly effective and cost-effective. IUD use is limited in some regions, however, due to concerns about increased risk of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and subsequent complications such as infertility and ectopic pregnancy. Recent reviews suggest that the overall risk of PID with modern IUDs is lower than previously thought, at least in regions with a low prevalence of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Risk of PID may be higher, however, in places where gonorrhoea and chlamydia are prevalent, where screening for STIs is limited and where aseptic conditions for insertion are difficult to ensure. A World Health Organization multi-centre study and other studies have confirmed regional differences in STI prevalence, and the WHO study established that PID risk is temporally related to IUD insertion procedures. Studies of the effectiveness of antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent infectious complications are inconclusive due at least in part to use of sub-therapeutic regimens for pathogens commonly implicated in PID. In summary, the IUD can be safe and effective if inserted under aseptic conditions in women free of cervical infection. Further study is needed to define appropriate standards of care for IUD insertion where STI prevalence is high and ability to rule out infection is limited. Even with safe insertion, IUD promotion in areas of high STI/HIV prevalence must address women's needs for dual protection from infection and unwanted pregnancy.","Having multiple sexual partners was not associated with an increased risk of pelvic inflammatory disease unless those partners carry specific infections, such as gonorrhea or chlamydia."
"Should the varicella vaccine be given to all children to prevent chickenpox
In February 1999, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) expanded recommendations for varicella (chickenpox) vaccine to promote wider use of the vaccine for susceptible children and adults. The updated recommendations include establishing child care and school entry requirements, use of the vaccine following exposure and for outbreak control, use of the vaccine for some children infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and vaccination of adults and adolescents at high risk for exposure. These recommendations also provide new information on varicella vaccine postlicensure safety data.",Varicella is the leading cause of vaccine-preventable death in children.
"What treatments prevent miscarriage after recurrent pregnancy loss
Recurrent miscarriage and later pregnancy complications are in some cases associated with placental thrombosis and infarction. The aim of this study was to assess the value of low dose aspirin (75 mg daily) in improving the subsequent livebirth rate amongst women with either unexplained recurrent early miscarriage (<13 weeks gestation; n = 805) or unexplained late pregnancy loss (n = 250). Amongst women with recurrent early miscarriages, there was no significant difference in the livebirth rate between those who took aspirin (251/367; 68.4%) compared with those who did not take aspirin [278/438; 63.5%; odds ratio (OR) 1.24; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.93-1.67]. This relationship was independent of the number of previous early miscarriages. In contrast, women with a previous late miscarriage who took aspirin had a significantly higher livebirth rate (122/189; 64.6%) compared with those who did not take aspirin (30/61; 49.2%: OR 1.88; 95% CI 1.04-3.37). The empirical use of low dose aspirin amongst women with unexplained recurrent early miscarriage is not justified. We are currently investigating the role of incremental doses of aspirin in the treatment of women both with early miscarriages associated with thrombophilic abnormalities and in those with late pregnancy losses.","A second (unblinded) trial randomized 805 women from a large referral center (mean age 34 years) with a history of first-trimester recurrent spontaneous abortion (not differentiated between primary and secondary RSA) of unknown cause to either 75 mg of aspirin daily or no treatment. There was no significant difference in the live birth rate between those who took aspirin (251/367; 68.4%) and those who did not (278/438; 63.5%; OR=1.24; 95% CI, 0.93-1.67)."
"What is the best initial treatment of Parkinson's disease
A randomized, prospective trial in 90 de novo parkinsonian patients showed that 4 years' treatment with lisuride resulted in significantly fewer end-of-dose disturbances and peak-dose dyskinesias, but also less improvement in parkinsonian disability, than with levodopa. Early combination of lisuride and a low dose of levodopa, during a 4-year follow-up, resulted in a therapeutic response equal to that achieved with high-dose levodopa alone, but significantly fewer end-of-dose failures and dyskinesias. Thus it seems advisable that treatment should begin in the early phase of the disease with a dopamine agonist such as lisuride combined with a low dose of levodopa.",Studies of other dopamine agonists show results comparable with bromocriptine. Lisuride (not available in the US) with rescue levodopa vs levodopa alone had fewer motor complications at 4 years but lower UPDRS and activities of daily living scores.
"Can infants/toddlers get enough fluoride through brushing
To estimate the overall effect of 1000 ppm F relative to 250 ppm F toothpaste. Experimental caries increment studies from the dental literature, which compared 1000 ppm with 250 ppm fluoride toothpastes, were summarized using meta-analytic methods. The overall caries reduction of 1000 ppm F relative to 250 ppm F paste was estimated to be 0.142 (95%-CL: 0.074-0.210) when applying a fixed effects model and 0.129 (95%-CL: 0.012-0.230) when applying a random effects model. The present analysis found slightly lower caries increments (14%, 13%) in children using 1000 ppm F toothpastes compared to children using 250 ppm F pastes. On the other hand, the use of 1000 ppm F pastes is associated with dental fluorosis. Considering these effects it seems justifiable to the authors to keep the use of 250 ppm F pastes for preschool children in Switzerland.",High-fluoride-concentration toothpastes (1000 ppm F) prevent 14% more caries than low-fluoride-concentration toothpastes (250 ppm F).
"What is the best test to diagnose urinary tract stones
Our aim was to compare unenhanced helical CT and excretory urography in the assessment of patients with renal colic. Fifty-three of 70 consecutive patients with acute signs of renal colic were prospectively examined with unenhanced helical CT, which was followed immediately by excretory urography. Two radiologists who were unaware of the findings independently interpreted these examinations to determine the presence or absence of ureteral obstruction. On all CT scans that had positive findings for ureteral stones or obstruction, we looked for secondary signs of obstruction (perinephric or periureteral fat stranding, ureteral wall edema, ureteral dilatation, and blurring of renal sinus fat). A stone was recovered in 45 of the 53 patients, nine before and 36 after imaging. The latter 36 patients had their stones identified on CT, whereas only 24 patients had their stones identified on excretory urography. Eight patients without stone disease had normal ureters on both CT and excretory urography. Of the 45 patients who had stone disease, 26 had ureteral dilatation on both CT and excretory urography, and 36 patients who recovered a stone after CT had secondary signs of obstruction. Of the nine patients who recovered a stone before CT, three had secondary signs of obstruction. Two patients had periureteral fat stranding, ureteral wall edema, and renal sinus fat blurring. One patient had only ureteral wall edema. Compared with excretory urography, unenhanced helical CT is better for identifying ureteral stones in patients with acute ureterolithiasis. Secondary CT signs of obstruction, including renal sinus fat blurring, were frequently present even when the stone was eliminated before imaging.","The Belgian study enrolled 53 of 70 consecutive patients. This study compared helical computerized tomography with intravenous pyelography (IVP) and used the gold standard of recovery and direct visualization of a stone. In this study, helical computerized tomography correctly identified every instance of urinary tract stones. In contrast, excretory urography failed to detect stones in a third of the patients with stones, and 44% of the negative readings were false-negatives. Both tests did well in reporting negative results for those patients without stones (specificity = 97% for both tests). In terms of likelihood ratios, helical computerized tomography and excretory urography had positive likelihood ratios of 29 and 19, respectively, and negative likelihood ratios of 0 and 0.36 (a lower negative likelihood ratio is better). In other words, helical computerized tomography appears to be far superior to excretory urography in ruling out the presence of urinary tract stones."
"How do we evaluate a marginally low B12 level
The performance of holotranscobalamin (holoTC) was compared with the other markers of vitamin B12 deficiency, and the influence of age, renal function, and thyroid status was examined. We examined 937 individuals not treated with vitamin B12 but in whom vitamin B12 deficiency was suspected because of a plasma methylmalonic acid (MMA) above 0.28 micromol L(-1) within the past 4 years. Besides laboratory tests, a structured interview and a neurological examination were performed amongst 534 individuals. Amongst these, 140 individuals qualified for a randomized trial (MMA 0.40-2.00 micromol L(-1)). They were randomized to injections with vitamin B12 or placebo and re-examined after 3 months. One university hospital in Aarhus, Denmark. The ROC curves indicate that holoTC (AUC: 0.90) compared favourable with plasma vitamin B12 (AUC: 0.85) for identifying individuals likely to have vitamin B12 deficiency (MMA > or =0.75 micromol L(-1) and plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) > or =15 micromol L(-1)), and further that holoTC (AUC: 0.91) might replace combined testing with plasma vitamin B12 and the metabolites. No association was observed between the biochemical markers and symptoms and signs possibly related to vitamin B12 deficiency. HoloTC, TC saturation, plasma vitamin B12, MMA, and tHcy were significantly associated with plasma creatinine (all with P <0.001). Only tHcy was significantly associated with thyroid stimulating hormone (P=0.02). HoloTC shows promise as first-line tests for diagnosing early vitamin B12 deficiency.","Holotranscobalamin may become a first-choice assay for diagnosing early vitamin B12 deficiency. Studies have shown that it compares favorably with current combined measures (B12 levels, methylmalonic acid, homocysteine). Like current assays, holotranscobalamin is also affected by renal function. It requires further investigation to establish relevant cutoff levels before it can be recommended as a diagnostic strategy."
"What is the appropriate use of sunscreen for infants and children
High nevus density is a risk factor for cutaneous malignant melanoma. Melanocytic nevi originate in childhood and are largely caused by solar exposure. To determine whether use of broad-spectrum, high-sun protection factor (SPF) sunscreen attenuates development of nevi in white children. Randomized trial conducted June 1993 to May 1996. A total of 458 Vancouver, British Columbia, schoolchildren in grades 1 and 4 were randomized in 1993. After exclusion of nonwhite children and those lost to follow-up or with missing data, 309 children remained for analysis. Each child's nevi were enumerated at the start and end of the study in 1996. Parents of children randomly assigned to the treatment group (n=222) received a supply of SPF 30 broad-spectrum sunscreen with directions to apply it to exposed sites when the child was expected to be in the sun for 30 minutes or more. Children randomly assigned to the control group (n=236) received no sunscreen and were given no advice about sunscreen use. Number of new nevi acquired during the 3 years of the study, compared between treatment and control groups. Children in the sunscreen group developed fewer nevi than did children in the control group (median counts, 24 vs 28; P=.048). A significant interaction was detected between freckling and study group, indicating that sunscreen use was much more important for children with freckles than for children without. Modeling of the data suggests that freckled children assigned to a broad-spectrum sunscreen intervention would develop 30% to 40% fewer new nevi than freckled children assigned to the control group. Our data indicate that broad-spectrum sunscreens may attenuate the number of nevi in white children, especially if they have freckles. JAMA. 2000.",A randomized controlled trial (RCT) demonstrated that regular use of broad-spectrum sunscreen in young school-aged children resulted in fewer melanotic nevi compared with controls.
"What's the best treatment for pyogenic granuloma
Pyogenic granuloma is a frequently diagnosed, benign vascular lesion. To present the use of the combined continuous-wave/pulsed carbon dioxide (CO2) laser as an innovative therapeutic method, to compare it with established methods, and to assess its results. Prospective observational study between March 1998 and July 2000, comprising 1 treatment session with 6-week and 6-month follow-up examinations and evaluations. Private or institutional practices as well as ambulatory or hospitalized care. One hundred patients with pyogenic granuloma selected from a population-based sample. Treatment with CO2 laser. The laser was first used in continuous mode (power, 15 W) and then in pulsed mode (pulse length, 0.6-0.9 milliseconds; energy fluence, 500 mJ/pulse). Complete resolution of treated granuloma pyogenicum. Pyogenic granuloma was removed completely in 1 treatment session in 98 patients without recurrence. In 88 cases there were no visible scars; in 10 cases slight textural changes of the skin were observed. Hypertrophic scars or keloids did not occur. Sixty-three patients were very satisfied with the result of the treatment, 37 were satisfied (ie, 100% patient satisfaction), and none indicated that they were not satisfied. No permanent hypopigmentation, hyperpigmentation, or erythema was observed. The combined continuous-wave/pulsed CO2 laser is our treatment of choice for pyogenic granuloma because this kind of laser is widely available, produces excellent results with few adverse effects, is easy to use, yields low recurrence rates, and is well tolerated by most patients.",A case series of 100 patients (mean age 27 years; range 6 months to 84 years) treated with CO2 laser reported that the pyogenic granuloma was removed completely in 1 session in 98 patients. Twelve percent of patients had visible scarring and another 10% had slight textural skin changes. All patients reported satisfaction with the results.
"When should you admit a patient with suspected community acquired pneumonia
Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a leading infectious cause of death throughout the world, including Hong Kong. To compare the ability of three validated prediction rules for CAP to predict mortality in Hong Kong: the 20 variable Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI), the 6-point CURB65 scale adopted by the British Thoracic Society and the simpler CRB65. A prospective observational study of 1016 consecutive inpatients with CAP (583 men, mean (SD) age 72 (17) years) was performed in a university hospital in the New Territories of Hong Kong in 2004. The patients were classified into three risk groups (low, intermediate and high) according to each rule. The ability of the three rules to predict 30 day mortality was compared. The overall mortality and intensive care unit (ICU) admission rates were 8.6% and 4.0%, respectively. PSI, CURB65 and CRB65 performed similarly, and the areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve were 0.736 (95% CI 0.687 to 0.736), 0.733 (95% CI 0.679 to 0.787) and 0.694 (95% CI 0.634 to 0.753), respectively. All three rules had high negative predictive values but relatively low positive predictive values at all cut-off points. Larger proportions of patients were identified as low risk by PSI (47.2%) and CURB65 (43.3%) than by CRB65 (12.6%). All three predictive rules have a similar performance in predicting the severity of CAP, but CURB65 is more suitable than the other two for use in the emergency department because of its simplicity of application and ability to identify low-risk patients.","When compared with CURB-65 and CRB-65, the PSI has similar sensitivity and specificity in predicting 30-day mortality. All 3 predictive rules had high negative predictive values for mortality but a low positive predictive value at all cutoff points."
"Do antioxidants vitamins C, E improve outcomes in patients with coronary artery disease
Observational and experimental studies suggest that the amount of vitamin E ingested in food and in supplements is associated with a lower risk of coronary heart disease and atherosclerosis. We enrolled a total of 2545 women and 6996 men 55 years of age or older who were at high risk for cardiovascular events because they had cardiovascular disease or diabetes in addition to one other risk factor. These patients were randomly assigned according to a two-by-two factorial design to receive either 400 IU of vitamin E daily from natural sources or matching placebo and either an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor (ramipril) or matching placebo for a mean of 4.5 years (the results of the comparison of ramipril and placebo are reported in a companion article). The primary outcome was a composite of myocardial infarction, stroke, and death from cardiovascular causes. The secondary outcomes included unstable angina, congestive heart failure, revascularization or amputation, death from any cause, complications of diabetes, and cancer. A total of 772 of the 4761 patients assigned to vitamin E (16.2 percent) and 739 of the 4780 assigned to placebo (15.5 percent) had a primary outcome event (relative risk, 1.05; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.95 to 1.16; P=0.33). There were no significant differences in the numbers of deaths from cardiovascular causes (342 of those assigned to vitamin E vs. 328 of those assigned to placebo; relative risk, 1.05; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.90 to 1.22), myocardial infarction (532 vs. 524; relative risk, 1.02; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.90 to 1.15), or stroke (209 vs. 180; relative risk, 1.17; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.95 to 1.42). There were also no significant differences in the incidence of secondary cardiovascular outcomes or in death from any cause. There were no significant adverse effects of vitamin E. In patients at high risk for cardiovascular events, treatment with vitamin E for a mean of 4.5 years had no apparent effect on cardiovascular outcomes.","One double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized controlled trials demonstrated no change in all-cause mortality or incidence of total cardiovascular events."
"Should we use SSRIs to treat adolescents with depression
A decade of increasing antidepressant medication treatment for adolescents and corresponding declines in suicide rates raise the possibility that antidepressants have helped prevent youth suicide. To evaluate the relationship between regional changes in antidepressant medication treatment and suicide in adolescents from 1990 to 2000. Analysis of prescription data from the nation's largest pharmacy benefit management organization, national suicide mortality files, regional sociodemographic data from the 1990 and 2000 US Census, and regional data on physicians per capita. Youth aged 10 to 19 years who filled a prescription for antidepressant medication and same-aged completed suicides from 588 three-digit ZIP code regions in the United States. The relationship between regional change in antidepressant medication treatment and suicide rate stratified by sex, age group, regional median income, and regional racial composition. There was a significant adjusted negative relationship between regional change in antidepressant medication treatment and suicide during the study period. A 1% increase in adolescent use of antidepressants was associated with a decrease of 0.23 suicide per 100 000 adolescents per year (beta = -.023, t = -5.14, P<.001). In stratified adjusted analyses, significant inverse relationships were present among males (beta = -.032, t = -3.81, P<.001), youth aged 15 to 19 years (beta = -.029, t = -3.43, P<.001), and regions with lower family median incomes (beta = -.023, t = -3.73, P<.001). An inverse relationship between regional change in use of antidepressants and suicide raises the possibility of a role for using antidepressant treatment in youth suicide prevention efforts, especially for males, older adolescents, and adolescents who reside in lower-income regions.","An ecological analysis of prescription data and US Census data found an overall decline in suicide rates as the rate of prescriptions for SSRI medications increased, suggesting a beneficial correlation of SSRI medications on suicide rates."
"Should we screen for ovarian cancer
The National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Conference on Ovarian Cancer-Screening, Treatment, and Follow-up brought together epidemiologists; obstetrician/gynecologists; gynecologic, medical, and radiation oncologists; and the public to address the following questions: (1) What is the current status of screening and prevention in ovarian cancer? (2) What is the appropriate management of early-stage ovarian cancer? (3) What is the appropriate management of advanced epithelial ovarian cancer? (4) What is the appropriate follow-up after primary therapy? and (5) What are the directions for future research? The consensus panel concluded that there is no evidence available as yet that the current screening modalities of CA 125 and transvaginal ultrasonography can be effectively used for widespread screening to reduce mortality from ovarian cancer nor that their use will result in decreased rather than increased morbidity and mortality. They recommended that further prospective research be done to evaluate this very important issue. Women with stage IA grade 1 and most IB grade 1 ovarian cancer do not require postoperative adjuvant therapy. Many remaining stage I patients do require chemotherapy. Subsets of stage I must be fully defined and ideal treatment must be determined. Women with stages II, III, and IV epithelial ovarian cancer (other than low malignant potential tumors) should receive postoperative chemotherapy. Physicians should be encouraged to discuss clinical trial participation with women, and women should be encouraged to participate. All women should have access to accurate and complete information regarding ovarian cancer. Furthermore, there must be no barriers to women's access to qualified specialists, optimal therapy, and protocols. The full text of the consensus panel's statement follows.","An national institutes of health Consensus Conference recommends comprehensive family history and annual pelvic exam for all women, referral to a specialist for risk counseling for women with 2 or more first-degree relatives, and annual screening with pelvic examination, CA-125, and transvaginal sonography in women with known hereditary ovarian cancer syndrome."
"When should you suspect community-acquired MRSA? How should you treat it
Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is increasingly recognized in infections among persons in the community without established risk factors for MRSA. We enrolled adult patients with acute, purulent skin and soft-tissue infections presenting to 11 university-affiliated emergency departments during the month of August 2004. Cultures were obtained, and clinical information was collected. Available S. aureus isolates were characterized by antimicrobial-susceptibility testing, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, and detection of toxin genes. On MRSA isolates, we performed typing of the staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec), the genetic element that carries the mecA gene encoding methicillin resistance. S. aureus was isolated from 320 of 422 patients with skin and soft-tissue infections (76 percent). The prevalence of MRSA was 59 percent overall and ranged from 15 to 74 percent. Pulsed-field type USA300 isolates accounted for 97 percent of MRSA isolates; 74 percent of these were a single strain (USA300-0114). SCCmec type IV and the Panton-Valentine leukocidin toxin gene were detected in 98 percent of MRSA isolates. Other toxin genes were detected rarely. Among the MRSA isolates, 95 percent were susceptible to clindamycin, 6 percent to erythromycin, 60 percent to fluoroquinolones, 100 percent to rifampin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and 92 percent to tetracycline. Antibiotic therapy was not concordant with the results of susceptibility testing in 100 of 175 patients with MRSA infection who received antibiotics (57 percent). Among methicillin-susceptible S. aureus isolates, 31 percent were USA300 and 42 percent contained pvl genes. MRSA is the most common identifiable cause of skin and soft-tissue infections among patients presenting to emergency departments in 11 U.S. cities. When antimicrobial therapy is indicated for the treatment of skin and soft-tissue infections, clinicians should consider obtaining cultures and modifying empirical therapy to provide MRSA coverage.",Incision and drainage remains the mainstay of abscess treatment.
"What medications are effective for treating symptoms of premenstrual syndrome PMS
To determine the effectiveness of oral micronized progesterone, alprazolam, and placebo in premenstrual syndrome (PMS) treatment and the effect of clinical contact on treatment responses. Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 3-month parallel treatment arms with flexible dosage and with the length of clinical contact randomized within each treatment group. University hospital PMS medical treatment outpatient program in obstetrics/gynecology department. Among volunteers for PMS treatment, 444 were evaluated and 185 meeting defined PMS criteria were randomized to treatment; treatment data are available for 170. There were no medical withdrawals for adverse events. A double-blinded protocol in which 300 mg of oral micronized progesterone, 0.25 mg of alprazolam, or placebo was administered four times a day from day 18 of the menstrual cycle through day 2 of the next cycle, including taper. The mean daily dose at the third treatment was 1760 mg of progesterone or 1.5 mg of alprazolam. Subjects were randomized to brief (< 20 minutes) or extended (50 minutes) visits. Daily symptom report (DSR) scored for total DSR symptoms, four DSR factors. Alprazolam was significantly better than placebo or progesterone for total premenstrual symptoms and DSR factors of mental function, pain, and mood. Thirty-seven percent of the alprazolam group experienced a 50% reduction in total DSR scores. There were no clinically significant withdrawal symptoms when alprazolam administration was restricted to the luteal phase. Oral micronized progesterone therapy was no better than placebo. Brief vs extended visits had no effect on treatment outcome. Treatment response was associated with severity of premenstrual symptoms at baseline but with no other diagnostic variables. Alprazolam has a role in PMS treatment and offers a therapy limited to the luteal phase. Oral micronized progesterone is ineffective for PMS.","Benzodiazepines have shown mixed results in treating PMS, and overall their benefit appears smaller than that of SSRIs. Luteal phase-only dosing theoretically reduces the risk of benzodiazepine withdrawal or dependence."
"For those intolerant to angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors and ARBs, what is the best therapy for reducing the risk of diabetic nephropathy
Achievement of recommended levels of blood pressure as prescribed by guidelines (i.e., systolic blood pressure of < 130 mmHg in people with nephropathy secondary to type 2 diabetes) generally requires three or more different antihypertensive agents that have complementary modes of action. This systolic goal blood pressure, recommended by generally all international guideline committees, was derived from largely observational studies demonstrating a greater reduction of cardiovascular risk and preservation of kidney function at these levels. Commonly used antihypertensive combinations include angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, which have compelling indications for use in people with kidney disease and/or diabetes, combined with a diuretic, generally a thiazide-type agent. If additional therapy is required, either a beta-blocker or a calcium antagonist may be added to this antihypertensive ""cocktail."" Beta-blockers are particularly effective in people with a high sympathetic drive (i.e., high pulse rates) to lower blood pressure and reduce cardiovascular risk. Moreover, in recent studies, their benefits on kidney function, both by reducing macroalbuminuria and slowing the decline of kidney function, make them good agents to add in the appropriate clinical setting. With all these potential benefits of achieving blood pressure goals, it is unfortunate that only 11% of people being treated for hypertension with diabetic kidney disease achieve the blood pressure goal of < 130 mmHg, likely contributing to the climbing incidence of people starting dialysis. Physicians need to work harder and educate patients on the importance of achieving these lower blood pressure guidelines.",An average of 3 antihypertensive medications are needed to achieve currently recommended blood pressure goals in those with diabetes.
"What is the most effective treatment for external genital warts
In an observer blind comparative study, 130 men with penile warts were randomly allocated to treatment with either cryotherapy or trichloroacetic acid (TCAA). There was no significant difference in response to treatment, side effects, or recurrence rates between the two treatments. Warts resolved in 81% of patients treated with TCAA compared with 88% of those treated with cryotherapy. Early recurrence occurred in 36% of patients treated with TCAA and in 39% of those treated with cryotherapy.",Cryotherapy is equivalent to trichloroacetic acid.
"What is the best surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma in chronic carriers of hepatitis B
To determine whether repeated screening can lead to early detection of primary liver cancer (PLC) and in turn to an improved clinical result. In this randomized controlled study, Shanghai urban residents aged 35-55 years and with serum evidence of HBV infection or chronic liver disease were eligible for recruitment. Using cluster sampling, these subjects were allocated into two groups-the screening group and the control group: there were 8109 subjects in the screening group and 9711 in the control group. Subjects in the screening group were tested with serum AFP and real-time ultrasound every 6 months. One to four rounds of screening were completed. Liver cancer was treated according to stage at diagnosis. All subjects enrolled were followed up and classed at the end-point as alive without liver cancer, alive with liver cancer, dead from liver cancer, or dead from another cause. The mean follow-up was 1.2 years; total follow-up was 12,038 person-years in the screening group and 9,573 person-years in the control group. We detected 38 patients with PLC in the screening group and 18 patients with PLC in the control group. In the patients in the screening group 76.8% of patients were at a subclinical stage, and 70.6% of them underwent resection, the 1- and 2-year survival rates being 88.1% and 77.5%, respectively. However, in the control group, none of the patients was at a subclinical stage when diagnosed, none of them underwent resection, and none of them survived over 1 year. The lead time was estimated at 0.45 years. The cost of detecting PLC at an early stage was RMB 12,600 (US$1,500). The study proved that screening the high-risk population for PLC with a serum AFP test and real-time ultrasound examination can detect patients in the early stages, increase the resection rate and prolong the survival time. It is therefore recommended that screening for PLC be advocated in any high-risk area.","A trial was performed in Shanghai, China and included 18,816 HBsAg+ patients aged 35 to 55 years. Subjects were recruited from their place of employment and randomized to either AFP/US every 6 months (n=9373) or to no screening (n=9443). Fifty-one hepatocellular carcinomas were diagnosed in the control group and 86 in screened group. Screened subjects had a significantly higher percentage of tumors that were less than 5 cm at the time of diagnosis and a higher number of patients who underwent resection. While the 5-year survival for those with hepatocellular carcinoma in the screened group was higher, the disease-specific mortality rate was not statistically different between the 2 groups."
"What test is the best for diagnosing infectious mononucleosis
Infectious mononucleosis should be suspected in patients 10 to 30 years of age who present with sore throat and significant fatigue, palatal petechiae, posterior cervical or auricular adenopathy, marked adenopathy, or inguinal adenopathy. An atypical lymphocytosis of at least 20 percent or atypical lymphocytosis of at least 10 percent plus lymphocytosis of at least 50 percent strongly supports the diagnosis, as does a positive heterophile antibody test. False-negative results of heterophile antibody tests are relatively common early in the course of infection. Patients with negative results may have another infection, such as toxoplasmosis, streptococcal infection, cytomegalovirus infection, or another viral infection. Symptomatic treatment, the mainstay of care, includes adequate hydration, analgesics, antipyretics, and adequate rest. Bed rest should not be enforced, and the patient's energy level should guide activity. Corticosteroids, acyclovir, and antihistamines are not recommended for routine treatment of infectious mononucleosis, although corticosteroids may benefit patients with respiratory compromise or severe pharyngeal edema. Patients with infectious mononucleosis should be withdrawn from contact or collision sports for at least four weeks after the onset of symptoms. Fatigue, myalgias, and need for sleep may persist for several months after the acute infection has resolved.",The sensitivity of heterophile antibody testing is lower in children under 12 (25%-50%) and early in the illness (25% false-negative rate in first week).
"Should you use antibiotics to treat acute otitis media in children
In 1995, >5 million episodes of acute otitis media (AOM) accounted for $3 billion in health care expenditures. To synthesize the literature on the natural history of AOM, the effectiveness of antibiotic treatment in uncomplicated AOM, and the relative effectiveness of specific antibiotic regimens. Seven electronic databases for articles published between 1966 and March 1999 and reference lists in proceedings, published articles, reports, and guidelines. Two physicians independently assessed each article. Studies addressing AOM in children 4 weeks to 18 years old were included; those addressing children with immunodeficiencies or craniofacial abnormalities were excluded. Randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) were used to assess antibiotic effectiveness, and RCTs and cohort studies were used to assess the natural history of AOM. Among the 3491 citations identified, 80 (2.3%) met our inclusion criteria. Two physicians independently abstracted data and assessed the quality of studies using a validated scale for RCTs and 8 quality components for cohort studies. Random-effects estimates of pooled absolute rate differences of outcomes were derived, and heterogeneity of both the rates and rate differences was assessed. Children with AOM not treated with antibiotics experienced a 1- to 7-day clinical failure rate of 19% (95% confidence interval: 0.10-0.28) and few suppurative complications. When patients were treated with amoxicillin, the 2- to 7-day clinical failure rate was reduced to 7%, a 12% (95% confidence interval: 0.04-0.20) reduction. Adverse effects, primarily gastrointestinal, were more common among children on cefixime than among those on ampicillin or amoxicillin. They were also more common among children on amoxicillin-clavulanate than among those on azithromycin. The majority of uncomplicated cases of AOM resolve spontaneously without apparent suppurative complications. Ampicillin or amoxicillin confers a limited therapeutic benefit. There is no evidence to support any particular antibiotic regimens as more effective at relieving symptoms. Certain antibiotics are more likely than others to cause diarrhea and other adverse events.","In meta-analyses of subsets of a systematic review that included 74 RCTs and 6 cohort studies, the 1- to 7-day clinical failure rate among children not given antibiotics for acute otitis media was 19% (95% CI, 0.10-0.28). Patients treated with ampicillin or amoxicillin had a 2- to 7-dayclinical failure rate of 7% (NNT=8; 95% CI, 0.04-0.20). Pooled analyses did not show any difference in efficacy between comparisons of penicillin, ampicillin, amoxicillin (2 or 3 times daily; standard or high dose), amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefaclor, cefixime, ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. An 8% higher incidence of diarrhea was noted for cefixime compared with amoxicillin (number needed to harm=12; 95% CI, 0.04-0.13). Azithromycin had a 19% lower adverse event rate than amoxicillin-clavulanate (NNT=5; 95% CI, 0.09-0.29)."
"What is the best treatment for pertussis
Whooping cough is a highly contagious disease. Infants are the population at highest risk of severe disease and death. Erythromycin for 14 days is recommended for treatment and contact prophylaxis but this regime is considered inconvenient and prolonged. The value of contact prophylaxis is uncertain. To study the benefits and risks of antibiotic treatment of and contact prophylaxis against whooping cough. The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2004); MEDLINE (January 1966 to February 2004); EMBASE (January 1974 to August 2003); conference abstracts and reference lists of articles were searched. Study investigators and pharmaceutical companies were approached for additional information (published or unpublished studies). There were no constraints based on language or publication status. All randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials of antibiotics for treatment of and contact prophylaxis against whooping cough were included in the systematic review. At least three reviewers independently extracted data and assessed the quality of each trial. Twelve trials with 1,720 participants met the inclusion criteria. Ten trials investigated treatment regimens and two investigated prophylaxis regimens. The quality of the trials was variable. Results showed that short-term antibiotics (azithromycin for three days, clarithromycin for seven days, or erythromycin estolate for seven days) were equally effective with long-term antibiotic treatment (erythromycin estolate or erythromycin for 14 days) in the microbiological eradication of Bordetella pertussis (B. pertussis) from the nasopharynx. The relative risk (RR) was 1.02 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.98 to 1.05). Side effects were fewer with short-term treatment (RR 0.66; 95% CI 0.52 to 0.83). There were no differences in clinical improvement or microbiological relapse between short and long-term treatment regimens. Contact prophylaxis (of contacts older than six months of age) with antibiotics did not significantly improve clinical symptoms or the number of cases that developed culture positive B. pertussis. Antibiotics are effective in eliminating B. pertussis from patients with the disease, rendering them non-infectious, but do not alter the subsequent clinical course of the illness. Effective regimens include: three days of azithromycin, seven days of clarithromycin, seven or 14 days of erythromycin estolate, and 14 days of erythromycin ethylsuccinate. Considering microbiological clearance and side effects, three days of azithromycin or seven days of clarithromycin are the best regimens. Seven days of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole also appeared to be effective for the eradication of B. pertussis from the nasopharynx and may serve as an alternative antibiotic treatment for patients who cannot tolerate a macrolide. There is insufficient evidence to determine the benefit of prophylactic treatment of pertussis contacts.","A 2005 Cochrane review of 11 RCTs and 1 quasi-randomized trial, with a total of 1720 adults and children, investigated several antibiotics for treatment and prophylaxis of pertussis. The outcome measures used to assess the efficacy of antibiotic treatment or prophylaxis vary between the trials and most of them did not report the immunization status of the participants. The Cochrane review included 1 meta-analysis of 3 studies with 252 participants, comparing azithromycin for 3 days, erythromycin estolate for 7 days, and clarithromycin for 7 days (short-term treatment) with erythromycin estolate for fourteen days (long-term treatment). The study showed equal efficacy in eradication of B pertussis from the nasopharynx of 99.2% to 97.7% (absolute risk reduction [ARR]=1.44%; 95% confidence interval [CI], -1.58 to 4.46). There were fewer side effects with the short-term treatment (32.1% vs 48.9%; ARR=16%; 95% CI, 7.84 to 25.84)."
"Should you test or treat partners of patients with gonorrhea, chlamydia, or trichomoniasis
To examine the effectiveness of methods to improve partner notification by patient referral (index patient has responsibility for informing sex partners of their exposure to a sexually transmitted infection). Systematic review of randomised trials of any intervention to supplement simple patient referral. Seven electronic databases searched (January 1990 to December 2005) without language restriction, and reference lists of retrieved articles. Selection of trials, data extraction, and quality assessment were done by two independent reviewers. The primary outcome was a reduction of incidence or prevalence of sexually transmitted infections in index patients. If this was not reported data were extracted according to a hierarchy of secondary outcomes: number of partners treated; number of partners tested or testing positive; and number of partners notified, located, or elicited. Random effects meta-analysis was carried out when appropriate. 14 trials were included with 12 389 women and men diagnosed as having gonorrhoea, chlamydia, non-gonococcal urethritis, trichomoniasis, or a sexually transmitted infection syndrome. All studies had methodological weaknesses that could have biased their results. Three strategies were used. Six trials examined patient delivered partner therapy. Meta-analysis of five of these showed a reduced risk of persistent or recurrent infection in patients with chlamydia or gonorrhoea (summary risk ratio 0.73, 95% confidence interval 0.57 to 0.93). Supplementing patient referral with information for partners was as effective as patient delivered partner therapy. Neither strategy was effective in women with trichomoniasis. Two trials found that providing index patients with chlamydia with sampling kits for their partners increased the number of partners who got treated. Involving index patients in shared responsibility for the management of sexual partners improves outcomes. Health professionals should consider the following strategies for the management of individual patients: patient delivered partner therapy, home sampling for partners, and providing additional information for partners.","A meta-analysis of the above studies evaluated the effect of expedited partner therapy compared with patient referral on the rate of recurrent or persistent gonorrhea, chlamydia, and trichomoniasis and the number of partners treated per index patient. Empiric therapy was associated with a lower rate of recurrent or persistent infections (risk ratio [RR]=0.73; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.57-0.93) and a higher number of partners treated per patient (RR=1.44; 95% CI, 1.12-1.86)."
"How useful is ultrasound to evaluate patients with postmenopausal bleeding
Our aim was to determine the diagnostic accuracy of endometrial thickness measurement by pelvic ultrasonography for predicting endometrial carcinoma and disease (hyperplasia and/or carcinoma) during an investigation of postmenopausal bleeding. We performed a systematic quantitative review of the available published literature, which consisted of online searching the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases (1966-2000) coupled with scanning of bibliography of known primary and review articles. The selection of studies, assessment of study quality, and extraction of data were performed in duplicate under masked conditions. Included in the analyses were 57 studies with 9031 patients. Accuracy data were summarized using likelihood ratios for various cut-off levels of abnormal endometrial thickness. The commonest cut-offs were 4 mm (9 studies) and 5 mm (21 studies), measuring both endometrial layers. None of the nine studies using the < or = 4 mm cut-off level were of good quality. Only four studies (out of the 21) used the < or = 5 mm cut-off level, which employed the best-quality criteria. Using the pooled estimates from these four studies only, a positive test result raised the probability of carcinoma from 14.0% (95% CI 13.3-14.7) to 31.3% (95% CI 26.1-36.3), while a negative test reduced it to 2.5% (95% CI 0.9-6.4). In conclusion, ultrasound measurement of endometrial thickness alone, using the best-quality studies cannot be used to accurately rule. However, a negative result at < or = 5 mm cut-off level measuring both endometrial layers in the presence of endometrial pathology rules out endometrial pathology with good certainty.","A 2002 meta-analysis of 57 cohort studies, without consistently applied reference standards, published between 1966 and 2000 included a total of 9031 women with postmenopausal bleeding. Because many of the studies were felt to use inadequately stringent criteria for diagnosis, the authors limited their final analysis to only 4 studies. They concluded that a negative result using a 5-mm threshold rules out endometrial pathology with fair certainty (LR- = 0.21)."
"Does lowering diastolic blood pressure to less than 90 mm Hg decrease cardiovascular risk
We critically appraised the medical literature to evaluate whether there is a point beyond which blood pressure reduction in hypertensive subjects is no longer beneficial and possibly even deleterious. Thirteen studies that stratified cardiovascular outcomes by level of achieved blood pressure in treated hypertensive subjects who had been followed up for at least 1 year were critiqued by four independent reviewers. Data addressing population, protocol, and methodological characteristics were evaluated. Studies did not show a consistent J-shaped relationship between treated blood pressure and stroke, but they did demonstrate a consistent J-shaped relationship for cardiac events and diastolic blood pressure. The beneficial therapeutic threshold point was 85 mm Hg. We conclude that low treated diastolic blood pressure levels, ie, below 85 mm Hg, are associated with increased risk of cardiac events.","Farnett et al derived a summary curve from 13 studies that stratified cardiovascular outcomes by level of achieved blood pressure; the nadir of the curve for ischemic heart disease events occurred at 86 to 89 mm Hg DBP. The risk was independent of type of drug therapy, and more pronounced in study subjects with known cardiovascular disease."
"What is the best way to treat tinea cruris
Butenafine hydrochloride, a potent antifungal agent related to the allylamines, has been used in Japan for treating various cutaneous mycoses including tinea cruris. We compared the safety and efficacy of butenafine hydrochloride and its vehicle when used once daily for 2 weeks to treat tinea cruris. Patients (n = 93) with tinea cruris and a positive potassium hydroxide examination and mycologic culture were enrolled. Of the 76 patients assessed for efficacy, 37 applied butenafine and 39 applied vehicle once daily for 2 weeks. Assessments were made at the end of the 2-week treatment period and 4 weeks after the end of treatment. Patients in the butenafine group had a higher mycologic cure rate by day 7 (66% vs 13%, p < 0.0001), with marked improvement 4 weeks after the end of treatment (81% vs 13%, p < 0.0001). They also had a higher rate of effective treatment at day 7 (29% vs 5%, p < 0.01) and at 4 weeks after treatment (73% vs 5%, p < 0.0001). Adverse events definitely related to butenafine treatment were limited to one case of burning sensation after application. Butenafine applied once daily for 2 weeks is effective in treating tinea cruris. The proportion of patients cured increased between the end of treatment and 4 weeks after treatment.","in a study of 76 patients with tinea cruris; after 2 weeks of daily application, 78% (modified intent-to-treat group) were mycologically cured.

"Is folate supplementation indicated for patients with coronary artery disease
Plasma homocysteine level has been recognized as an important cardiovascular risk factor that predicts adverse cardiac events in patients with established coronary atherosclerosis and influences restenosis rate after percutaneous coronary intervention. To evaluate the effect of homocysteine-lowering therapy on clinical outcome after percutaneous coronary intervention. Randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial involving 553 patients referred to the University Hospital in Bern, Switzerland, from May 1998 to April 1999 and enrolled after successful angioplasty of at least 1 significant coronary stenosis (> or = 50%). Participants were randomly assigned to receive a combination of folic acid (1 mg/d), vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin, 400 micro g/d), and vitamin B6 (pyridoxine hydrochloride, 10 mg/d) (n = 272) or placebo (n = 281) for 6 months. Composite end point of major adverse events defined as death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and need for repeat revascularization, evaluated at 6 months and 1 year. After a mean (SD) follow-up of 11 (3) months, the composite end point was significantly lower at 1 year in patients treated with homocysteine-lowering therapy (15.4% vs 22.8%; relative risk [RR], 0.68; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.48-0.96; P =.03), primarily due to a reduced rate of target lesion revascularization (9.9% vs 16.0%; RR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.40-0.97; P =.03). A nonsignificant trend was seen toward fewer deaths (1.5% vs 2.8%; RR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.16-1.70; P =.27) and nonfatal myocardial infarctions (2.6% vs 4.3%; RR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.24-1.51; P =.27) with homocysteine-lowering therapy. These findings remained unchanged after adjustment for potential confounders. Homocysteine-lowering therapy with folic acid, vitamin B12, and vitamin B6 significantly decreases the incidence of major adverse events after percutaneous coronary intervention.","A randomized, placebo-controlled trial of folate reporting clinical endpoints has been completed. The study analyzed folate supplementation in 553 post-PCI patients. Patients were treated with 1 mg of folate plus 10 mg of vitamin B6 and 400 µg of vitamin B12 for 6 months after the PCI. After a mean follow-up of 11 months, the rate of restenosis requiring revascularization was lower in the vitamin-treated study arm (9.9% vs 16% restenosis rate; relative risk [RR]=0.62; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.40-0.97; number needed to treat=16).

"How effective is gastric bypass for weight loss
To examine the effect of a large, long standing and intentional weight reduction on the incidence of diabetes, hypertension and lipid disturbances in severely obese individuals as compared to weight-stable obese controls. The ongoing prospective SOS (Swedish Obese Subjects) intervention consists of a surgically treated group and a matched control group obtaining conventional obesity treatment. This report is based on 845 surgically treated patients and 845 controls (BMI 41.0+/-4.6 kg/m2 (mean+/-standard deviation [S])) followed for 2 years. Surgically treated patients lost 28+/-15 kg and controls 0.5+/-8.9 kg (p<0.0001). Two-year incidence of hypertension, diabetes, hyperinsulinemia, and lipid disturbances was compared in the two treatment groups. Adjusted odds ratios (95% CI) for the surgically treated group versus controls were 0.38 (0.22, 0.65) for hypertension, 0.02 (0.00, 0.16) for diabetes, 0.10 (0.03, 0.28) for hyperinsulinemia, 0. 10 (0.04, 0.25) for hypertriglyceridemia, 0.28 (0.16, 0.49) for low HDL-cholesterol and 1.24 (0.84, 1.8) for hypercholesterolemia. Compared to controls, the 2-year recovery rates from hypertension, diabetes, hypo-HDL, and hypertriglyceridemia were significantly higher in the surgically treated group. Intentional weight loss in the obese causes a marked reduction in the 2-year incidence of hypertension, diabetes and some lipid disturbances. The results suggest that severe obesity can and should be treated.","In the Swedish Obesity Study, hypertriglyceridemia decreased postoperatively but hypercholesterolemia did not."
"What is the best way to manage phantom limb pain
Pain after amputation is common but difficult to treat. Therefore, the authors examined whether postoperative treatment with gabapentin could reduce postamputation stump and phantom pain. Forty-six patients scheduled to undergo lower limb amputation were randomly assigned to receive oral gabapentin or placebo. Treatment was started on the first postoperative day and continued for 30 days. The daily dose of gabapentin or placebo was gradually increased to 2,400 mg/day. The intensity of stump and phantom pain was recorded every day on a numeric rating scale (0-10) during the 30-day treatment period. Five interviews were performed after 7, 14, and 30 days and after 3 and 6 months. Results from 41 patients were included in the data analysis. The risk of phantom pain (gabapentin vs. placebo) was 55.0% versus 52.6% (risk difference, 2.4%; 95% confidence interval, -28.9 to 33.7%; P = 0.88; 30 days) and 58.8% versus 50.0% (risk difference, 8.8%; 95% confidence interval, -23.3 to 40.9%; P = 0.59; 6 months). The median intensity of phantom pain (gabapentin vs. placebo) was 1.5 (range, 0-9.0) versus 1.2 (range, 0-6.6) (P = 0.60; 30 days) and 1.0 (range, 0-6.0) versus 0.5 (range, 0-5.0) (P = 0.77; 6 months). The median intensity of stump pain was 0.85 (range, 0-8.2) versus 1.0 (range, 0-5.4) (P = 0.68; 30 days) and 0 (range, 0-8.0) versus 0 (range, 0-5.0) (P = 0.58; 6 months). Gabapentin administered in the first 30 postoperative days after amputation does not reduce the incidence or intensity of postamputation pain.",A 2006 randomized controlled trials of gabapentin did not identify significant pain reductions.
"What's the best treatment for sebaceous cysts

The inflammation is secondary to sebaceous cyst wall rupture with leakage of cyst contents, which elicits the inflammatory response."
"Do statins delay onset or slow progression of Alzheimer's dementia
Increasing evidence suggests that cholesterol plays a role in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer disease (AD). For instance, an elevated serum cholesterol level has been shown to be a risk factor for AD. To determine whether patients taking 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins), which are a group of medicines that inhibit the synthesis of cholesterol, have a lower prevalence of probable AD. The experiment uses a cross-sectional analysis comparing the prevalence of probable AD in 3 groups of patients from hospital records: the entire population, patients receiving 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (hereafter referred to as the statins), and patients receiving medications used to treat hypertension or cardiovascular disease. The subjects studied were those included in the computer databases of 3 different hospitals for the years October 1, 1996, through August 31, 1998. Diagnosis of probable AD. We find that the prevalence of probable AD in the cohort taking statins during the study interval is 60% to 73% (P < .001) lower than the total patient population or compared with patients taking other medications typically used in the treatment of hypertension or cardiovascular disease. There is a lower prevalence of diagnosed probable AD in patients taking 2 different 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors-lovastatin and pravastatin. While one cannot infer causative mechanisms based on these data, this study reveals an interesting association in the data, which warrants further study. Arch Neurol. 2000;57:1439-1443","An observational study of 56,790 charts included in the computer databases of 3 hospitals found that the prevalence of probable Alzheimer's dementia in the cohort taking statins was 60% to 73% P<.001 lower than in the total patient population or in patients taking antihypertensive or cardiovascular medications."
"Can infants/toddlers get enough fluoride through brushing
Fluoride toothpastes have been widely used for over three decades and remain a benchmark intervention for the prevention of dental caries. To determine the effectiveness and safety of fluoride toothpastes in the prevention of caries in children and to examine factors potentially modifying their effect. We searched the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (May 2000), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2000), MEDLINE (1966 to January 2000), plus several other databases. We handsearched journals, reference lists of articles and contacted selected authors and manufacturers. Randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials with blind outcome assessment, comparing fluoride toothpaste with placebo in children up to 16 years during at least one year. The main outcome was caries increment measured by the change in decayed, missing and filled tooth surfaces (D(M)FS). Inclusion decisions, quality assessment and data extraction were duplicated in a random sample of one third of studies, and consensus achieved by discussion or a third party. Authors were contacted for missing data. The primary measure of effect was the prevented fraction (PF) that is the difference in caries increments between the treatment and control groups expressed as a percentage of the increment in the control group. Random effects meta-analyses were performed where data could be pooled. Potential sources of heterogeneity were examined in random effects meta-regression analyses. Seventy-four studies were included. For the 70 that contributed data for meta-analysis (involving 42,300 children) the D(M)FS pooled PF was 24% (95% confidence interval (CI), 21 to 28%; p<0.0001). This means that 1.6 children need to brush with a fluoride toothpaste (rather than a non-fluoride toothpaste) over three years to prevent one D(M)FS in populations with caries increment of 2.6 D(M)FS per year. In populations with caries increment of 1.1 D(M)FS per year, 3.7 children will need to use a fluoride toothpaste for three years to avoid one D(M)FS. There was clear heterogeneity, confirmed statistically (p<0.0001). The effect of fluoride toothpaste increased with higher baseline levels of D(M)FS, higher fluoride concentration, higher frequency of use, and supervised brushing, but was not influenced by exposure to water fluoridation. There is little information concerning the deciduous dentition or adverse effects (fluorosis). Supported by more than half a century of research, the benefits of fluoride toothpastes are firmly established. Taken together, the trials are of relatively high quality, and provide clear evidence that fluoride toothpastes are efficacious in preventing caries.","A meta-analysis found that the effect of topical fluoride was independent of water fluoridation, suggesting that topical fluoride toothpaste has a beneficial effect even in communities with fluoridated water."
"What are the most effective ways you can help patients stop smoking
The aim of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is to replace nicotine from cigarettes. This reduces withdrawal symptoms associated with smoking cessation thus helping resist the urge to smoke cigarettes. The aims of this review were:to determine the effectiveness of the different forms of NRT (chewing gum, transdermal patches, nasal spray, inhalers and tablets) in achieving abstinence from cigarettes, or a sustained reduction in amount smoked; to determine whether the effect is influenced by the clinical setting in which the smoker is recruited and treated, the dosage and form of the NRT used, or the intensity of additional advice and support offered to the smoker; to determine whether combinations of NRT are more effective than one type alone; to determine its effectiveness compared to other pharmacotherapies. We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group trials register in March 2004. Randomized trials in which NRT was compared to placebo or to no treatment, or where different doses of NRT were compared. We excluded trials which did not report cessation rates, and those with follow up of less than six months. We extracted data in duplicate on the type of participants, the dose, duration and form of nicotine therapy, the outcome measures, method of randomization, and completeness of follow up. The main outcome measure was abstinence from smoking after at least six months of follow up. We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence for each trial, and biochemically validated rates if available. For each study we calculated summary odds ratios. Where appropriate, we performed meta-analysis using a Mantel-Haenszel fixed effect model. We identified 123 trials; 103 contributing to the primary comparison between NRT and a placebo or non-NRT control group. The odds ratio (OR) for abstinence with NRT compared to control was 1.77 (95% confidence intervals (CI): 1.66 to 1.88). The ORs for the different forms of NRT were 1.66 (95% CI: 1.52 to 1.81) for gum, 1.81 (95% CI: 1.63 to 2.02) for patches, 2.35 (95% CI: 1.63 to 3.38) for nasal spray, 2.14 (95% CI: 1.44 to 3.18) for inhaled nicotine and 2.05 (95% CI: 1.62 to 2.59) for nicotine sublingual tablet/lozenge. These odds were largely independent of the duration of therapy, the intensity of additional support provided or the setting in which the NRT was offered. In highly dependent smokers there was a significant benefit of 4 mg gum compared with 2 mg gum (OR 2.20, 95% CI: 1.85 to 3.25). There was weak evidence that combinations of forms of NRT are more effective. Higher doses of nicotine patch may produce small increases in quit rates. Only one study directly compared NRT to another pharmacotherapy. In this study quit rates with bupropion were higher than with nicotine patch or placebo. All of the commercially available forms of NRT (gum, transdermal patch, nasal spray, inhaler and sublingual tablets/lozenges) are effective as part of a strategy to promote smoking cessation. They increase the odds of quitting approximately 1.5 to 2 fold regardless of setting. The effectiveness of NRT appears to be largely independent of the intensity of additional support provided to the smoker. Provision of more intense levels of support, although beneficial in facilitating the likelihood of quitting, is not essential to the success of NRT.","nicotine replacement therapy reduces withdrawal symptoms associated with stopping smoking by partially replacing nicotine in the blood.

In severe alcoholic hepatitis (AH), 40% of patients will obtain no benefit from corticosteroids. Improvement in management of non-responders is warranted and only pentoxifylline can be considered an alternative. A two-step strategy was evaluated consisting of early withdrawal of corticosteroids and a switch to pentoxifylline for 28 additional days in non-responders identified using early change in bilirubin level. One hundred and twenty-one patients with AH were treated prospectively with corticosteroids, and the two-step strategy was proposed to 29 non-responders treated according to a two-step strategy who were compared to 58 matched non-responders treated with corticosteroids only. Clinical and biological features of the two groups were similar. There was no survival improvement at 2 months in patients treated with the two-step strategy compared to controls: 35.5+/-6.3% vs 31+/-8.6%. After 21 days, biological evolution was similar for prothrombin time (-0.25s vs +0.2s), bilirubin (0.8 mg/dl vs 2.03 mg/dl) and creatinine (+0.16 mg/dl vs -0.7 mg/dl). In multivariate analysis, only age, evolution of bilirubin during the first week, creatinine and DF were associated with 2-month survival. Non-responders to corticosteroids do not obtain any benefit from an early switch to pentoxifylline. Thus, the issue of management of non-responders remains unresolved.","A cohort study evaluated the effect of switching to pentoxifylline in hospitalized patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis who did not respond to initial therapy with steroids. Researchers identified 121 patients who were treated initially with 40 mg oral prednisolone daily. The 36 patients who failed to show a drop in bilirubin levels within 7 days were switched to oral pentoxifylline, 400 mg twice a day. In the pentoxifylline group, 69% of patients died within 2 months, 27.6% of whom had some form of renal insufficiency. This outcome was not statistically different from that of 58 matched historical controls with severe alcoholic hepatitis who were maintained on oral prednisolone despite failure to respond within the first week of therapy (65% mortality, 20% with renal insufficiency)."
"How effective are hypertension self-care interventions
Lack of adherence to blood pressure lowering medication is a major reason for poor control of hypertension worldwide. Interventions to improve adherence to antihypertensive medication have been evaluated in randomised trials but it is unclear which interventions are effective. To determine the effectiveness of interventions aiming to increase adherence to blood pressure lowering medication in adults with high blood pressure All-language search of all articles (any year) in the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (CCTR), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL in April 2002. RCTs of interventions to increase adherence to blood pressure lowering medication in adults with essential hypertension in primary care, with adherence to medication and blood pressure control as outcomes Two authors extracted data independently and in duplicate and assessed each study according to the criteria outlined by the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook. We included 38 studies testing 58 different interventions and containing data on 15519 patients. The studies were conducted in nine countries between 1975 and 2000. The duration of follow-up ranged from two to 60 months. Due to heterogeneity between studies in terms of interventions and the methods used to measure adherence, we did not pool the results. Simplifying dosing regimens increased adherence in seven out of nine studies, with a relative increase in adherence of 8 per cent to 19.6 per cent. Motivational strategies were successful in 10 out of 24 studies with generally small increases in adherence up to a maximum of 23 per cent. Complex interventions involving more than one technique increased adherence in eight out of 18 studies, ranging from 5 per cent to a maximum of 41 per cent. Patient education alone seemed largely unsuccessful. Reducing the number of daily doses appears to be effective in increasing adherence to blood pressure lowering medication and should be tried as a first line strategy, although there is less evidence of an effect on blood pressure reduction. Some motivational strategies and complex interventions appear promising, but we need more evidence on their effect through carefully designed RCTs.","A Cochrane review included 38 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of 58 various types of interventions (some tested in factorial trials) designed to improve patient adherence to antihypertensive medications in ambulatory settings. The quality of the studies was generally low due to inadequate allocation concealment, lack of blinding of outcome assessors, loss to follow-up, and the small number of participants in trials. The authors grouped interventions into 4 broad categories: simplification of dosing regimens; patient education; patient motivation, support, and reminders; and complex interventions. Comparison groups received either no intervention, usual care, or-in the case of simplification of dosing regimens-a daily regimen consisting of more than 1 pill per day vs a once-daily regimen. Because of various types of interventions and different methods of assessing outcomes, pooling of results was, appropriately, not done. Of all the interventions, simplification of dosing regimens had the most evidence of effectiveness, with 7 out of 9 studies demonstrating a statistically significant improvement in adherence in the intervention group. In the other 2 studies, improved adherence was observed in the intervention group; however, the effect was either not statistically significant or not reported."
"How does pentoxifylline affect survival of patients with alcoholic hepatitis
An earlier pilot study from our liver unit suggested benefit from treatment with pentoxifylline (PTX), an inhibitor of tumor necrosis factor (TNF), in severe acute alcoholic hepatitis. The aim of the present study was to evaluate this treatment in a larger cohort of patients. One hundred one patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis (Maddrey discriminant factor > or = 32) entered a 4-week double-blind randomized trial of PTX (400 mg orally 3 times daily) vs. placebo. Primary endpoints of the study were the effect of PTX on (1) short-term survival and (2) progression to hepatorenal syndrome. On randomization, there were no differences in demographic and clinical characteristics or laboratory values (including TNF) between the 2 groups. Twelve (24.5%) of the 49 patients who received PTX and 24 (46.1%) of the 52 patients who received placebo died during the index hospitalization (P = 0.037; relative risk, 0.59; 95% confidence interval, 0.35-0.97). Hepatorenal syndrome was the cause of death in 6 (50%) and 22 (91.7%) patients (P = 0.009; relative risk, 0.29; 95% confidence interval, 0.13-0.65). Three variables (age, creatinine level on randomization, and treatment with PTX) were independently associated with survival. TNF values on randomization were not predictive of survival; however, during the study period they increased markedly in nonsurvivors compared with survivors in both groups. Treatment with PTX improves short-term survival in patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis. The benefit appears to be related to a significant decrease in the risk of developing hepatorenal syndrome. Increasing TNF levels during the hospital course are associated with an increase in mortality rate.","In a hospital-based clinical trial, 101 patients admitted with severe alcoholic hepatitis (mean age 42 years, 74% men) were randomized to oral pentoxifylline 400 mg twice a day or placebo (vitamin B12 tablets) for 4 weeks. The main outcome measures were short-term survival and progression to hepatorenal syndrome. Severe alcoholic hepatitis was defined as a Maddrey discriminant factor (DF) >32, jaundice, and at least one of the following: tender hepatomegaly, fever, leukocytosis, hepatic encephalopathy, or hepatic systolic bruit. The DF is calculated as follows: 4.6 x [prothrombin time in seconds - control time] + bilirubin (mg/dL). Medical management was ""individualized according to each patient's condition"". Pentoxifylline therapy was associated with decreased mortality during the index hospitalization (relative risk [RR]=0.59; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.35-0.97; number needed to treat [NNT]=5). Hepatorenal syndrome also decreased (RR=0.29; 95% CI, 0.13-0.65; NNT=4). Patients in the pentoxifylline group tended to have more headaches and gastrointestinal side effects, but no other serious health hazards were observed."
"What is the best therapy for constipation in infants
Hypertonic sodium phosphate enema solutions are commonly used for the treatment of acute constipation in the pediatric emergency department. The potential for severe metabolic derangement and death in children with gastrointestinal and/or renal abnormalities and these reported as normal has been documented in the literature. To develop guidelines for the safe and effective use of hypertonic sodium phosphate enema solutions such as Fleet enema, in the pediatric emergency department setting. A comprehensive review of the literature was conducted using the MEDLINE database for the time period 1966 to September 1995. Resources used within our institution, the Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, included Staff of the Emergency and General Surgery Departments. The guidelines provided will promote safe use of hypertonic sodium phosphate enema solutions for the treatment of acute constipation in children presenting to the emergency department.","Sodium phosphate enemas in children under 2 years of age have been associated with electrolyte disturbances, dehydration, and cardiac arrest."
"Should we identify and treat hyperlipidemia in the advanced elderly
To determine whether hypercholesterolemia is an independent risk factor for CHD morbidity and mortality in persons aged 65 years and above, and to quantify the magnitude of the association, if any, using data from follow-up studies. A MEDLINE search of all published studies that evaluated the association between high cholesterol levels and CHD in persons aged 65 years and above, and the relevant articles referenced in these studies, were used as sources of selected articles. In men aged 65 years and above who were followed from middle age, the RR for CHD incidence associated with 1.0 mmol/L increase in total cholesterol was 1.28 (CI: 1.17-1.39). The RR for CHD mortality associated with a similar increase in total cholesterol was 1.22 (CI: 1.18-1.27). In elderly men followed from age 65 and above, the RR was 1.24 (CI: 1.1-1.37) for CHD incidence, and 1.22(CI: 1.15-1.28) for CHD mortality. In elderly women followed after age 65, the association between total cholesterol and CHD mortality was not significant. For men aged 80 years and above at entry, total cholesterol showed an inverse relationship with all-cause mortality. Serum total cholesterol shows a positive association with CHD morbidity and mortality in men aged 65 years and above. This may, however, not hold true for persons aged 80 years and above.","A meta-analysis showed an inverse relationship between total serum cholesterol and all-cause mortality for people aged 80 and above, raising the possibility that lowering cholesterol may be detrimental in this age group."
"Is pneumococcal vaccine effective in nursing home patients
Pneumococcal vaccine effectiveness was assessed in a randomized trial among 1,686 old people (mean age: 74, standard deviation: 4 years) living in 24 geriatric hospitals and 26 homes for the aged in our district; 937 were vaccinated with Merck-Sharp and Dohme pneumococcal vaccine (14 serotypes). The 749 others composed the reference group. This study was performed during 2 years, since December 1980. Both groups were randomized after a two-criteria stratification: by clinical risk assessed before the study, and by type of homes for the aged. Forty pneumonias were diagnosed, with 13 proved pneumococcal etiology. The incidence of pneumonia was significantly reduced in the vaccinated group (p less than 10(-4) but the mortality rate was not modified. We concluded in favor of the effectiveness of pneumococcal vaccine: etiological fraction 77.1% (51.2%-89.3% confidence limits, 95% risk) in the population we studied. The incidence of pneumococcal-proved pneumonia was not significantly reduced.","A prospective, risk-stratified, randomized study of the 14-valent pneumococcal vaccine in 1686 patients living in hospices and nursing homes in France showed an absolute risk reduction (ARR) of 2.9% in the incidence of all-cause pneumonia, corresponding to a number needed to treat (NNT) of 35. This study has 2 major limitations: the authors did not comment on whether the study was blinded, and 31% of patients were lost to follow-up."
"What is the best way to evaluate acute diarrhea
To develop an evidence and consensus based guideline for the management of the child who presents to hospital with diarrhoea (with or without vomiting), a common problem representing 16% of all paediatric medical attenders at an accident and emergency department. Clinical assessment, investigations (biochemistry and stool culture in particular), admission, and treatment are addressed. The guideline aims to aid junior doctors in recognising children who need admission for observation and treatment and those who may safely go home. A systematic review of the literature was performed. Selected articles were appraised, graded, and synthesised qualitatively. Statements on recommendation were generated. CONSENSUS: An anonymous, postal Delphi consensus process was used. A panel of 39 selected medical and nursing staff were asked to grade their agreement with the generated statements. They were sent the papers, appraisals, and literature review. On the second and third rounds they were asked to re-grade their agreement in the light of other panelists' responses. Consensus was predefined as 83% of panelists agreeing with the statement. Clinical signs useful in assessment of level of dehydration were agreed. Admission to a paediatric facility is advised for children who show signs of dehydration. For those with mild to moderate dehydration, estimated deficit is replaced over four hours with oral rehydration solution (glucose based, 200-250 mOsm/l) given ""little and often"". A nasogastric tube should be used if fluid is refused and normal feeds started following rehydration. Children at high risk of dehydration should be observed to ensure at least maintenance fluid is tolerated. Management of more severe dehydration is detailed. Antidiarrhoeal medication is not indicated. The guideline has been successfully implemented and evaluated in a paediatric accident and emergency department.",A systematic review found no published studies about the likelihood of specific diagnoses in children presenting to the hospital with diarrhea.
"What is the best workup for hypocalcemia
The incidence and the clinical implications of hypocalcemia were evaluated in acutely ill patients admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit of the Detroit Receiving Hospital. Total and ionized calcium levels were prospectively evaluated upon admission for all patients over a three-month interval. A high proportion of patients (62 of 88, 70 percent) were found to have decreased levels of both total and ionized calcium. Known causes of hypocalcemia could be identified in only 28 patients (45 percent). These included hypomagnesemia (17, 28 percent), renal insufficiency (five, 8 percent), alkalosis (four, 6 percent), and acute pancreatitis (two, 3 percent). In the remaining 34 patients (55 percent), no readily identifiable cause could be found. These 34 patients had a lower mean albumin level than did the 23 normocalcemic patients (p less than 0.01), but there were no differences in age, pH, serum creatinine, magnesium, or phosphate between the two groups. Serum albumin correlated directly with ionized calcium levels (n = 82, r = 0.33, p less than 0.01), as well as with total calcium levels (n = 76, r = 0.70, p less than 0.01). There was a strong association between sepsis and hypocalcemia. Patients who survived the hospitalization had higher mean ionized calcium, total calcium, and albumin values than did nonsurvivors, but there were no differences in age, serum creatinine, magnesium, and phosphate between the two groups. The mortality of the hypocalcemic patients (44 percent) was significantly greater (p less than 0.05) than the mortality of the normocalcemic patients (17 percent). These findings suggest that hypocalcemia is a very common abnormality in acutely ill patients and is associated with a poor prognosis.","In a study of 62 hypocalcemic patients in a medical intensive care unit, the cause of the hypocalcemia could be determined in only 28 (45%); most of the cases were caused by hypomagnesemia (28%), renal insufficiency (8%), and pancreatitis (3%)."
"Is the ThinPrep better than conventional Pap smear at detecting cervical cancer
In a study using a split-sample design, liquid-based cytology (ThinPrep Processor, Cytyc Corporation, Boxborough, MA) was compared with the conventional Papanicolaou (Pap) smear in Guanacaste, Costa Rica. The study provides the first population-based comparison of the ThinPrep screening technology and includes ""gold standard"" measures of diagnostic accuracy. The population-based study was performed among over 8000 women residing in a Costa Rican province with a high incidence of cervical carcinoma. Conventional smears were prepared and diagnosed in Costa Rica, while the residual material on the sampling device was collected into a liquid preservative and shipped to the U.S., where ThinPrep cytologic slides were prepared and diagnosed. Cytologic diagnoses based on the two techniques, categorized according to the Bethesda System, were compared with a ""gold standard"" final case diagnosis for each patient, also based on Bethesda terminology, that reflected an integrated interpretation of all available data, including cytology, histology, and cervicography. Results were also compared with the results of HPV DNA detection (Hybrid Capture, Digene Corporation, Silver Spring, MD). ASCUS was the threshold for colposcopy referral. There were significantly more women referred according to this threshold with the ThinPrep slide (12.7%) than with the conventional smear (6.7%, P<0.001). Compared with the final case diagnosis, referral by ThinPrep slides detected 92.9% of cases with high grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL) and 100% of carcinoma cases. Smears detected 77.8% of HSIL and 90.9% of carcinomas. Thus, ThinPrep cytology was significantly more sensitive in the detection of HSIL and cancer (McNemar test, P<0.001). Adjudication of cases in which the ThinPrep and smear diagnoses disagreed, using the final case diagnoses and the HPV DNA test results as reference standards, suggested that the ThinPrep method was detecting additional true SIL as opposed to false-positives. In a population-based study of high risk women, ThinPrep cytology demonstrated significantly increased sensitivity for detecting HSIL and carcinoma, with a concurrent significant increase in colposcopy referrals.","This prospective, population-based study of 8636 women reported that the ThinPrep was significantly more sensitive than the conventional smears at detecting high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL) and cancer, with sensitivity rates of 92.9% and 100% vs 77.8% and 90.9%, respectively (P<.001). This evidence demonstrates that the ThinPrep is better at detecting cervical cancer."
"What nonpharmacological treatments are effective against common nongenital warts
Cutaneous warts are a common presenting complaint in children and adolescents. Common, plantar, or flat warts are cutaneous manifestations of the human papillomavirus. The treatment of warts poses a therapeutic challenge for physicians. No single therapy has been proven effective at achieving complete remission in every patient. As a result, many different approaches to wart therapy exist. These approaches are discussed to demonstrate the evidence supporting common therapies and provide a guideline for physicians. Evidence supports the at-home use of topical salicylic acid and physician-administered cryotherapy. Intralesional immunotherapy for nongenital cutaneous warts may be an option for large or recalcitrant warts.","Since adverse effects from treatment, such as pain and scarring, can occur, patients should be educated as to options of therapy (or no therapy)."
"Which treatments are effective for cervical radiculopathy
The purpose of this study was to conduct a systematic analysis of the literature to assess the efficacy of traction for patients with neck or back pain. For this purpose, randomized clinical trials comparing traction with other treatments were selected. A computer-aided search of the literature was conducted for relevant articles, followed by blinded assessment of the methods of the studies. The main outcome measures were (1) scoring for quality of the designated conduct of studies (based on a methodological checklist with four main categories: study population, interventions, measurement of effect, and data presentation) and the main conclusions of author(s) with regard to traction and (2) calculation of confidence intervals and power of the studies. Only three studies scored more than 50 points (maximum score = 100 points), suggesting that most of the selected studies were of poor quality. None of these three studies showed favorable results for traction. Only four studies, of which one scored more than 50 points, had an acceptable power (1- beta > 80%). The available reports of studies on the efficacy of traction for back and neck pain do not allow clear conclusions due to the methodological flaws in their design and conduct. Most studies lacked power (1-beta) due to small sample sizes. To date, no conclusions can be drawn about whether a specific traction modality for back or neck pain is effective, or more efficacious than other treatments. There are no clear indications, however, that traction is an ineffective therapy for back and neck pain. Further trials are needed in which much more attention should be paid to proper design and conduct, as well as to clear descriptions of crucial methodological features and results.","3 RCTs showed no advantages (2 studies) or modest advantages (1 study) for cervical traction over placebo or standard physical therapy without traction. Each study defined improvement differently, but most patients in all groups showed improvement."
"Do topical antibiotics improve wound healing
Little data exists comparing the safety and efficacy of triple antibiotic ointment (TAO) and mupirocin for prevention of uncomplicated soft tissue wound infections. The purpose of this investigation was to conduct a pilot study of the relative safety, efficacy, and cost effectiveness of the 2 preparations. This was a randomized, prospective, interventional study to determine the difference in infection rates of uncomplicated soft tissue wounds between subjects treated with TAO and mupirocin ointment after standard wound care and suturing. Subjects were enrolled at presentation to the ED if they met the study inclusion criteria and were required to make one follow-up visit to the ED to determine the status of their wound (infected vs. not infected). A total of 99 patients were enrolled and assessed at the follow-up visit. The groups had similar rates of self-reported compliance with wound care and dressing changes. Patients in the mupirocin group had a greater rate of signs of infection (12% vs. 6.1%), and infection (4% vs. 0%) compared with patients in the TAO group, although neither difference achieved statistical significance. There were no serious adverse effects in either group. This pilot study found a similar rate of wound infection and adverse events between TAO and mupirocin ointments. Results should be confirmed in a larger equivalency trial.","A small randomized prospective trial of 99 patients, who self-reported compliance with wound care and dressing changes, compared Neosporin with mupirocin (Bactroban) in preventing infections in uncomplicated soft tissue wounds. The study found no statistical difference in infection rates, and the authors recommend the more cost-effective Neosporin, as well as a larger trial to confirm the results."
"What is the recommended workup for a man with a first urinary tract infection
To explore the prevalence and microbiology of urinary tract infection (UTI) in symptomatic men in a primary care setting and to determine the appropriateness of patient management of these conditions by the general practitioners. A cross-sectional survey was carried out matching documentation of symptoms and management with urine culture and results of susceptibility tests. All patients presenting with symptoms typical for a UTI in 36 teaching general practices in the area of Göttingen, Germany, were eligible for enrolment in the study. 15% (n = 90) of all patients were adult men. General practitioners (GPs) were instructed to manage patients as usual. Patient characteristics, dipstick tests and treatment were matched with results of urine cultures and susceptibility testing. Men presenting with symptoms indicative of UTI were predominantly elderly (median age 61 years) and 41% had additional risk factors. Antibiotics were prescribed for 36%, but these were not well-targeted. Urine culture revealed UTI in 60%, of which half had low colony counts (23% of all patients) or multiple bacterial growth (7%); 40% had sterile urine. Dipstick tests proved unhelpful: leukocytes and nitrite had sensitivities of 54% and 38%, specificities of 55% and 84%, positive predictive values of 65% and 78% and negative predictive values of 44% and 46%, respectively. Resistance levels were 53% for amoxicillin and cefaclor, 28% for cefixim, 22% for ciprofloxacin, 34% for both trimethoprim as individual substance and the combination with sulfamethoxazole (cotrimoxazole) and 25% for nitrofurantoin. Men with symptoms indicative of a UTI should not be treated empirically. A urine culture and antibiogram should be obtained before a treatment decision is made. A low-count UTI was common and should not be considered normal.",A urine culture is recommended to reliably diagnose an infection and guide treatment.
"Are any alternative therapies effective in treating asthma
Previous reports have shown that ion content in the air may have an effect on respiratory function. Results from studies which test the efficacy of air ionisers to reduce asthma symptoms are often inconclusive and their use as a treatment for asthma remains debatable. We conducted a systematic review of the available evidence to determine the effectiveness of positive and negative ion generators in people with asthma. We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Asthma trials register (January 1966 to March 2003), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Cochrane Library issue 2, 2003) as well as The Alternative Medicine Database AMED (1985 to March 2003). Randomised controlled trials (parallel or crossover design studies) comparing ionisers with dummy ionisers (being negative or positive ion emitters), in children or adults with chronic asthma. Two reviewers independently assessed titles and abstracts of studies and assessed trial quality. Study quality was determined using two methods:The Cochrane approach to allocation concealment and the five point Jadad scale. Six studies were selected for inclusion (106 participants). No results were combined as the studies were all of a crossover design. EFFECTS OF NEGATIVE ION GENERATORS (five studies)No study reported a significant difference in lung function between ionised and control air (morning Peak expiratory flow (PEF) - three studies; forced expiratory flow in one second (FEV1) - one study). There were no significant differences in symptoms or beta-2 agonist usage between ionised and control air in three studies. EFFECTS OF POSITIVE ION GENERATORS (one study)This study demonstrated that although positively ionised air was associated with a larger fall in FEV1 with exercise, this did not reach statistical significance. Baseline FEV1 was not demonstrated to be significantly different between treatment groups. Based on the evidence currently available from randomised controlled trials, a recommendation cannot be given for the use of room air ionisers to reduce symptoms in patients with chronic asthma.","Cochrane review of 6 good-quality trials with a total of 106 participants reported no significant effect of room air ionizers on pulmonary function measures, symptoms, or medication use."
"Do inhaled steroids increase the risk of osteoporosis
Inhaled corticosteroids are clearly beneficial for patients with asthma of moderate severity, but the risks and benefits of using them in patients with milder asthma are less clear. We have compared the change in bone mineral density over 2 years in adults with mild asthma randomised to receive an inhaled corticosteroid or non-corticosteroid treatment. Subjects with mild asthma (mean forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV(1)) 86% predicted, mean age 35 years, taking beta agonists only) were randomised to receive inhaled budesonide, inhaled beclomethasone dipropionate, or non-corticosteroid treatment for 2 years in a prospective randomised open study in 19 centres in France, New Zealand, Spain, and the UK. The corticosteroid dose was adjusted according to a written self-management plan. The main outcome measure-change in bone mineral density after 6, 12, and 24 months-was measured ""blind"". Secondary outcomes included lung function, the relation between change in bone density and inhaled steroid dose and change in biochemical markers of bone metabolism. Of 374 subjects randomised, 239 (64%) completed the study and were included in the analysis. The median daily doses of inhaled budesonide (n=87) and beclomethasone (n=74) were 389 microg and 499 microg, respectively. Subjects treated with an inhaled corticosteroid had better asthma control than those in the reference group (n=78). Change in bone mineral density did not differ between the three groups over the 2 years, nor did it correlate with changes in markers of bone metabolism. The mean change in bone mineral density over 2 years in the budesonide, beclomethasone dipropionate, and reference groups was 0.1%, -0.4%, and 0.4% for the lumbar spine and -0.9%, -0.9%, and -0.4% for neck of the femur. Mean daily dose of inhaled steroid was related to reduction in bone mineral density at the lumbar spine but not at the femoral neck. In subjects with mild asthma an inhaled corticosteroid provided better asthma control than alternative non-corticosteroid treatment with no difference in change in bone mineral density over 2 years. The relation between dose of inhaled corticosteroid and change in bone density at the lumbar spine may be due to a direct effect of inhaled corticosteroids on bone. Since inhaled steroid dose is also related inversely to lung function, an effect of asthma severity on bone density was also possible.","A large fair-quality randomized controlled trials from 2001 included in both meta-analyses demonstrated a dose-related fall in bone mineral density within the subjects over 2 years at the lumbar spine (standard deviation, 3.4%; P<.010). This finding remained statistically significant after adjusting for asthma severity, but bone mineral density changes were not different between the inhaled corticosteroids and placebo groups. However, this finding may be the result of higher oral corticosteroids use in the reference group."
"Which strategies work best to prevent obesity in adults
Weight gain occurs frequently in men aged 25-40. This study compared the effectiveness of a clinic-based and a home-based intervention with a no-treatment control group in preventing this weight gain. Men (n=67)-aged 25 to 40, sedentary, with a body mass index of 22 to 30, recruited from the University of Pittsburgh-were randomly assigned to 4-month treatments focused on increasing aerobic exercise and reducing fat intake through a clinic-based (CB) or a home-based (HB) program, or to a delayed-treatment control group. Subjects were reassessed at 4 months. Adherence and outcome did not differ significantly between the CB and HB programs, except that CB subjects recorded their food intake more frequently, and a greater number of CB subjects achieved a total of 120 miles of exercise over the 4 months. Subjects in the two intervention conditions combined lost significantly more weight (-1.6+/-2.5 kg) than control subjects, who gained 0.2+/-1.9 kg (p<0.01); this effect of treatment was seen primarily in men with a body mass index of 27 to 30 (-2.7 kg for CB and HB combined vs. + 1.5 kg for control). Treated subjects also had somewhat greater improvements in body composition, aerobic fitness, and weekly energy expenditure than controls, although these differences did not reach significance. Both CB and HB intervention show promise in preventing weight gain in young men, especially in those who are slightly overweight. Larger studies, using more representative samples of young men, appear warranted.","In one study, 67 patients were assigned to 4 months of clinic-based or home-based counseling to increase exercise and reduce fat intake, or to a control group. Weight change was-1.9 kg in the clinic-based group,-1.3 kg in the home-based group, and +0.22 kg in the control group (P=.007)."
"Which drugs are safest for moderate to severe depression in adolescents
There is a need to identify effective and safe treatments for depression in children and adolescents. While tricyclic drugs are effective in treating depression in adults, individual studies involving children and adolescents have been equivocal. To assess the effects of oral tricyclic antidepressants compared to placebo in the treatment of child and adolescent depression. We searched MEDLINE (1966-1997), EMBASE, Excerpta Medica (June 1974-1997), the Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group trials register (most recent search 25/1/2000) and bibliographies of previously published reviews and papers describing original research were cross-checked. Current Contents was screened for recent publications. We contacted authors of relevant abstracts in conference proceedings of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, and we hand searched the Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (1978-1999). Randomised controlled trials comparing the efficacy of orally administered tricyclic medication with placebo in depressed people aged 6-18 years. Most studies reported multiple outcome measures including depression scales and clinical global impression scales. For each study the best available depression measure was taken as the index measure of depression outcome. Predetermined criteria were established to assist in the ranking of measures. Where authors reported categorical outcomes we calculated individual and pooled odds ratios for the odds of improvement in treated compared with control subjects. For continuous outcomes pooled effect sizes were calculated as the number of standard deviations by which the change in depression scores for the treatment group exceeded those for the control groups. Thirteen trials (involving 506 participants) were included. No overall improvement with treatment compared to placebo was seen for children or adolescents (odds ratio = 0.84, 95% confidence interval 0.56 to 1.25). A statistically significant but small benefit of treatment over placebo was seen in reducing symptoms (effect size (standardised mean difference) = -0.31, 95% confidence interval -0.62 to -0.01). Subgroup analyses suggest a larger benefit among adolescents (effect size = -0.47, 95% confidence interval -0.92 to -0.02), and no benefit among children (effect size = 0.15, 95% confidence interval -0.34 to 0.64). Treatment with a tricyclic antidepressant caused more vertigo (odds ratio = 4.38, 95% confidence interval 2.33 to 8.25), orthostatic hypotension (odds ratio = 6.78, 95% confidence interval 2.06 to 22.26), tremor (odds ratio 6.29, 95% confidence interval 1.78 to 22.17) and dry mouth (odds ratio = 5.17, 95% confidence interval 2.68 to 29.99) than did placebo, but no statistically significant difference was found for other possible adverse effects. Data suggest tricyclic antidepressants are not useful in treating depression in pre pubertal children. There is marginal evidence to support the use of tricyclic antidepressants in the treatment of depression in adolescents, although the magnitude of effect is likely to be moderate at best.","Evidence concerning the safety of tri-cyclic antidepressants in adolescents is limited because adverse effects have not been systematically reported. A 2002 Cochrane meta-analysis found a statistically significant increase in rates of vertigo, orthostatic hypotension, tremor, and dry mouth among children and adolescents taking tricyclic antidepressants compared with placebo. The drugs are modestly effective in treating depression in adolescents; concerns about side effects and safety, however, have limited their use."
"History, exam, and labs: Is one enough to diagnose acute adult appendicitis
The importance of specific elements in the clinical diagnosis of appendicitis is controversial. This review analyses the diagnostic value of elements of disease history, clinical findings and laboratory test results in suspected appendicitis. A systematic Medline search was made of all published studies on the clinical and laboratory diagnosis of appendicitis in patients admitted to hospital with suspected disease. Meta-analyses of receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) areas, and positive and negative likelihood ratios, of 28 diagnostic variables described in 24 studies are presented. Inflammatory response variables (granulocyte count, proportion of polymorphonuclear blood cells, white blood cell count and C-reactive protein concentration), descriptors of peritoneal irritation (rebound and percussion tenderness, guarding and rigidity) and migration of pain were the strongest discriminators, with ROC areas of 0.78 to 0.68. The discriminatory power of the inflammatory variables was particularly strong for perforated appendicitis, with ROC areas of 0.85 to 0.87. Appendicitis was likely when two or more inflammatory variables were increased and unlikely when all were normal. Although all clinical and laboratory variables are weak discriminators individually, they achieve a high discriminatory power when combined. Laboratory examination of the inflammatory response, clinical descriptors of peritoneal irritation, and a history of migration of pain yield the most important diagnostic information and should be included in any diagnostic assessment.","In a series of 439 patients with symptoms suggestive of acute appendicitis, those with confirmed appendicitis (n=101) had a mean white blood cells count of 14.8 K/µL (95% CI, 13.9-15.8) and a mean neutrophil percentage of 82 (95% CI, 80-84). In contrast, those without appendicitis (n=338) had a mean white blood cells count of 9.2 K/µL (95% CI, 9.0-9.4) and a mean neutrophil percentage of 68 (95% CI, 66-70)."
"Who should have colposcopy
To quantify by meta-analysis the performance of colposcopy to set a standard against which new technologies can be compared. MEDLINE was searched for articles on colposcopy for diagnosis of squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL). The search selected articles from 1960 to 1996 combining the key word ""colposcopy"" with key words ""diagnosis,"" ""positive predictive value,"" ""negative predictive value,"" ""likelihood ratio,"" and ""receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve."" Articles were selected if the authors studied a population of patients with abnormal screening Papanicolaou smears and presented raw data showing for each cervical lesion type the number of patients judged positive and negative by colposcopic impression versus the standard of colposcopic biopsy results. Nine of 86 studies met these criteria. Biopsies had been categorized as normal, atypia, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) I, CIN II, CIN III, carcinoma in situ, and invasive cancer; we recalculated performance measures using the Bethesda system. Overall sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratios, ROC curves, and the corresponding areas under the curves were calculated. The average weighted sensitivity of diagnostic colposcopy for the threshold normal compared with all cervix abnormalities (atypia, low-grade SIL, high-grade SIL, cancer) was 96% and the average weighted specificity 48%. For the threshold normal cervix and low-grade SIL compared with high-grade SIL and cancer, average weighted sensitivity was 85% and average weighted specificity 69%. Likelihood ratios generated small but important changes in probability for distinguishing normal cervix and low-grade SIL from high-grade SIL and cancer. Areas under the ROC curve were 0.80 for the threshold normal cervix compared with all abnormalities and 0.82 for the threshold normal cervix and low-grade SIL compared with high-grade SIL and cancer. Colposcopy compares favorably with other medical diagnostic tests in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and area under the ROC curve. New diagnostic methods for the cervix can be compared with colposcopy using these quantified values.","Using histology as the gold standard, the sensitivity of colposcopy for cervical abnormalities is high 96%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 95%-97%, but the specificity is much lower 48%; 95% CI, 47%-49%. This low specificity means that more than half of women with no cervical pathology will have an abnormal colposcopy result. The corresponding positive and negative likelihood ratios are 2 and 0.1, respectively. Consequently, a normal colposcopy result can effectively rule out cervical pathology, thus supporting its role as a diagnostic rather than a screening tool."
"How accurate is the use of ECGs in the diagnosis of myocardial infarct
To ascertain the value of a range of methods - including clinical features, resting and exercise electrocardiography, and rapid access chest pain clinics (RACPCs) - used in the diagnosis and early management of acute coronary syndrome (ACS), suspected acute myocardial infarction (MI), and exertional angina. MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, the Cochrane Library and electronic abstracts of recent cardiological conferences. Searches identified studies that considered patients with acute chest pain with data on the diagnostic value of clinical features or an electrocardiogram (ECG); patients with chronic chest pain with data on the diagnostic value of resting or exercise ECG or the effect of a RACPC. Likelihood ratios (LRs) were calculated for each study, and pooled LRs were generated with 95% confidence intervals. A Monte Carlo simulation was performed evaluating different assessment strategies for suspected ACS, and a discrete event simulation evaluated models for the assessment of suspected exertional angina. For acute chest pain, no clinical features in isolation were useful in ruling in or excluding an ACS, although the most helpful clinical features were pleuritic pain (LR+ 0.19) and pain on palpation (LR+ 0.23). ST elevation was the most effective ECG feature for determining MI (with LR+ 13.1) and a completely normal ECG was reasonably useful at ruling this out (LR+ 0.14). Results from 'black box' studies of clinical interpretation of ECGs found very high specificity, but low sensitivity. In the simulation exercise of management strategies for suspected ACS, the point of care testing with troponins was cost-effective. Pre-hospital thrombolysis on the basis of ambulance telemetry was more effective but more costly than if performed in hospital. In cases of chronic chest pain, resting ECG features were not found to be very useful (presence of Q-waves had LR+ 2.56). For an exercise ECG, ST depression performed only moderately well (LR+ 2.79 for a 1 mm cutoff), although this did improve for a 2 mm cutoff (LR+ 3.85). Other methods of interpreting the exercise ECG did not result in dramatic improvements in these results. Weak evidence was found to suggest that RACPCs may be associated with reduced admission to hospital of patients with non-cardiac pain, better recognition of ACS, earlier specialist assessment of exertional angina and earlier diagnosis of non-cardiac chest pain. In a simulation exercise of models of care for investigation of suspected exertional angina, RACPCs were predicted to result in earlier diagnosis of both confirmed coronary heart disease (CHD) and non-cardiac chest pain than models of care based around open access exercise tests or routine cardiology outpatients, but they were more expensive. The benefits of RACPCs disappeared if waiting times for further investigation (e.g. angiography) were long (6 months). Where an ACS is suspected, emergency referral is justified. ECG interpretation in acute chest pain can be highly specific for diagnosing MI. Point of care testing with troponins is cost-effective in the triaging of patients with suspected ACS. Resting ECG and exercise ECG are of only limited value in the diagnosis of CHD. The potential advantages of RACPCs are lost if there are long waiting times for further investigation. Recommendations for further research include the following: determining the most appropriate model of care to ensure accurate triaging of patients with suspected ACS; establishing the cost-effectiveness of pre-hospital thrombolysis in rural areas; determining the relative cost-effectiveness of rapid access chest pain clinics compared with other innovative models of care; investigating how rapid access chest pain clinics should be managed; and establishing the long-term outcome of patients discharged from RACPCs.","A systematic review revealed similar findings where ST segment elevation (most commonly defined as at least 1 mm in 2 or more contiguous limb leads or at least 2 mm in 2 contiguous precordial leads) had a LR+=13.1 (95% confidence interval [CI], 8.28-20.6). This review also found that a ""completely normal"" electrocardiogram is reasonably useful in ruling out myocardial infarction with a LR-=0.14 (95% CI, 0.11-0.20)."
"What treatment works best for tennis elbow
Deep transverse friction massage (DTFM) is one of several physiotherapy interventions suggested for the management of tendinitis pain. To assess the efficacy of DTFM for treating tendinitis. We searched the MEDLINE, EMBASE, HealthSTAR, Sports Discus, CINAHL, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, PEDro, the specialized registry of the Cochrane musculoskeletal group and the Cochrane field of Physical and Related Therapies up to the end of June 2002. The reference list of the trials and key experts in the area were also consulted for additional studies. All randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) comparing therapeutic ultrasound with control or another active intervention in patients with all types of tendinitis, such as iliotibial band friction syndrome and extensor carpi radialis tendinitis (i.e. tennis elbow or lateral epicondylitis or lateralis epicondylitis humeri), were selected. Two reviewers determined the studies to be included based upon the inclusion and exclusion criteria (LB, VR). Data were independently abstracted by two reviewers (VR, LB), and checked by a third reviewer (BS) using a pre-developed form of the Cochrane Musculoskeletal Group. The two reviewers, using a validated checklist, assessed the methodological quality of the RCTs and CCTs independently. The pooled analysis was performed using weighted mean differences (WMDs) for continuous outcomes. One RCT included patients with ITBFS. DTFM combined with rest, stretching exercises, cryotherapy and therapeutic ultrasound was compared to the control group (rest, stretching exercises, cryotherapy and therapeutic ultrasound only). This trial showed no statistical difference in the three types of pain relief measured after four consecutive sessions of DTFM combined with other physiotherapy modalities for runners. There was a clinically important relative percentage difference in pain while running of 22%. A RCT on ECRT showed no statistical difference in pain relief, grip strength and the three types of functional status measured after 9 consecutive sessions within 5 weeks of DTFM compared with other physiotherapy modalities. DTFM combined with other physiotherapy modalities did not show consistent benefit over the control of pain, or improvement of grip strength and functional status for patients with ITBFS or for patients with ECRT. These conclusions are limited by the small sample size of the included RCTs. No conclusions can be drawn concerning the use or non use of DTFM for the treatment of ITBFS. Future trials, utilizing specific ITBFS methods and adequate sample sizes are needed, before conclusions can be drawn regarding the specific effect of DTFM on tendinitis.","Another Cochrane review found no added benefit in function from combining deep transverse friction massage with ultrasound or a placebo ointment (RR=3.3; 95% CI, 0.4-24.3)."
"Does birth weight predict childhood obesity
Differences in prenatal growth influence postnatal body fat. The objective was to investigate the role of parental body composition on the ""tracking"" of adolescent fatness. The study population consisted of 1993 white subjects and their parents. Measurements were taken at birth and again at the age of either 15, 16, or 17 y. The newborns were classified in 3 groups: small for gestational age, appropriate for gestational age, and large for gestational age. The mothers and fathers of the adolescents were classified into low and high subgroups on the basis of measurements of body mass index (BMI). Similarly, the mothers of the adolescents were classified into lean and fat subgroups on the basis of measurements of triceps skinfold thickness. Heavy newborns became heavier or fatter adolescents only when the mother or father was also fat and, among heavy newborns, the risk of becoming fat adolescents was approximately 5.7 times higher when the mother was fat rather than lean. Large newborns become fat adolescents only when the mother or father is also overweight or fat (ie, has either a high BMI or large skinfold thickness). These findings suggest that fatness during adolescence is related to parental fatness but not to prenatal fatness. Therefore, preventing higher levels of adiposity among newborns is unlikely to reduce overall adiposity in adolescence.","A prospective cohort study of 1993 white large-for-gestational-age infants found a greater propensity to become obese in adolescence, but only if their mothers or fathers were also obese (RR=5.7). Children with lean parents did not have an increased risk of being over-weight in adolescence."
"What is the best approach for managing recurrent bacterial vaginosis
Bacterial vaginosis is an imbalance of the normal vaginal flora with an overgrowth of anaerobic bacteria and a lack of the normal lactobacillary flora. Bacterial vaginosis during pregnancy has been associated with poor perinatal outcome and, in particular, preterm birth. Identification and treatment may reduce the risk of preterm birth and its consequences. To assess the effects of antibiotic treatment of bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy. We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group trials register (September 2002). Randomized trials comparing antibiotic treatment with placebo or no treatment, or comparing two or more antibiotic regimens in pregnant women with bacterial vaginosis. Two reviewers assessed trials and extracted data independently. Study authors were contacted for additional information. Ten trials involving 4249 women were included; all were of good quality. Antibiotic therapy was effective at eradicating bacterial vaginosis during pregnancy (odds ratio (OR) 0.21, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.18 to 0.24, eight trials of 3825 women). Treatment did not significantly reduce the risk of preterm birth before 37 weeks (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.10, eight trials of 4062 women), 34 weeks (OR 1.20, 95% CI 0.69 to 2.07, five trials of 851 women), or 32 weeks (OR 1.08, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.68, three trials of 3080 women). However, antibiotic treatment did significantly decrease the risk of preterm prelabour rupture of membranes (OR 0.32, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.67, three trials of 562 women). In women with a previous preterm birth, treatment did not affect the risk of subsequent preterm birth (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.17, five trials of 622 women) but it did decrease the risk of preterm prelabour rupture of membranes (OR 0.14, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.38, two trials of 114 women) and low birthweight (OR 0.31, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.75, five trials of 622 women). Antibiotic treatment can eradicate bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy. However, the current evidence does not support screening and treating all pregnant women with asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis to prevent preterm birth and its consequences. For women with a previous preterm birth, there is little suggestion that detection and treatment of bacterial vaginosis will prevent a further preterm birth, but it may reduce the risk of low birthweight and preterm prelabour rupture of membranes.",A Cochrane review of bacterial vaginosis and preterm labor suggests treating women at high risk for preterm birth may reduce the risk of low birthweight and preterm prelabor rupture of membranes.
"How much can exercise raise creatine kinase level-and does it matter
Serum samples from 14 men and 8 women were obtained pre-marathon (48 h) and at 24, 48, 72, and 96 h post-race to quantitate total serum creatine kinase activity (TCK), percentage of creatine kinase MB (CK-MB), and clearance rates (half-lives) of TCK and CK-MB. TCK was measured enzymatically, and the CK-MB isoenzyme was separated by agarose electrophoresis and quantitated by densitometry. The men's and women's post-race mean TCK levels were significantly elevated (P less than 0.05) above pre-race values at 24 h (3322 U . l-1, 946 U . l-1 and 48 h (1787 U . l-1, 508 U . l-1). In addition, CK-MB was significantly elevated both 24 h (5.1%, 3.3%) and 48 h (2.5%, 1.8%) post-race (P less than 0.05). The men's 24-h TCK was 22.3 times the pre-race value, while the women had an 8.6-fold increase in TCK. The mean 24-h post-race CK-MB activities were 166 U . l-1 for the men and 31 U . l-1 for the women. The mean increase in CK-MB activity was 41.5-fold for the men and 7.8-fold for the women. Furthermore, the men had a mean half-life (t1/2) of 30.4 h for TCK and 12.0 h for CK-MB; the women's t1/2's were 29.4 and 16.8 h, respectively. At all time points, the men evidenced significantly (P less than 0.05) higher TCK and CK-MB enzyme activities than did the women.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","Although exercise is known to elevate CK, it produces a wide range of levels, based on a host of variables."
"Which tests are the most useful for diagnosing pelvic inflammatory disease
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of clinical diagnosis of acute pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). Data were obtained on 176 consecutive women admitted to St. Elizabeth Hospital Medical Center with a clinical diagnosis of PID. All underwent diagnostic laparoscopy. PID was established laparoscopically in 134 (76.1%) of the patients. Statistical tests for significant associations between PID and each of 21 clinical indicators of the disease were conducted using the chi 2 and Mann-Whitney tests. Stepwise logistic regression was performed on those variables whose univariate tests of significant association with PID resulted in P values < 0.20. An optimal set of PID indicators consisted of adnexal tenderness, lower abdominal pain of < one week's duration and an elevated white blood cell count. Use of these indicators resulted in a test with an estimated sensitivity and specificity of 86.6% and 45.7%, respectively. Estimated predictive values for positive and negative test results were 0.84 and 0.52, respectively. These results confirm the fact that laparoscopy is the definitive diagnostic modality in PID.","A cohort study evaluated 176 consecutive admissions for clinically diagnosed PID, 76% of which were laparoscopically confirmed. Reviewing clinical indicators, they found that a combination of adnexal tenderness, symptoms for <1 week, and elevated white blood cells was the most sensitive set of predictors (sensitivity 86.6%, specificity 45.7%) with positive predictive value of 0.84 and negative predictive value of 0.52."
"Does warfarin prevent venous thromboembolic events in aPL-positive patients
A high incidence of both arterial and venous thromboembolic events has been reported in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), but the risks and benefits of primary prophylactic antithrombotic therapy have not been assessed. We measured the clinical benefit of 3 antithrombotic regimens in patients with SLE without antiphospholipid antibodies, with anticardiolipin antibodies, or with lupus anticoagulant. A Markov decision analysis was used to evaluate prophylactic aspirin therapy, prophylactic oral anticoagulant therapy, and observation. Input data were obtained by literature review. Clinical practice was simulated in a hypothetical cohort of patients with SLE who had not experienced any previous episode of arterial or venous thromboembolic events. For each strategy, we measured numbers of thromboembolic events prevented and major bleeding episodes induced, and quality-adjusted survival years. Prophylactic aspirin therapy was the preferred strategy in all settings, the number of prevented thrombotic events exceeding that of induced bleeding episodes. In the baseline analysis (40-year-old patients with SLE), the gain in quality-adjusted survival years achieved by prophylactic aspirin compared with observation ranged from 3 months in patients without antiphospholipid antibodies to 11 months in patients with anticardiolipin antibodies or lupus anticoagulant. Prophylactic oral anticoagulant therapy provided better results than prophylactic aspirin only in patients with lupus anticoagulant and an estimated bleeding risk of 1% per year or less. Prophylactic aspirin should be given to all patients with SLE to prevent both arterial and venous thrombotic manifestations, especially in patients with antiphospholipid antibodies. In selected patients with lupus anticoagulant and a low bleeding risk, prophylactic oral anticoagulant therapy may provide a higher utility.","Wahl et al constructed a decision analysis of antithrombotic therapy for patients with systemic lupus erythematosus with and without aPL. They compared observation alone with aspirin and with warfarin for the primary prevention of VTE. Using a decision analysis based on the best available efficacy rates, they recommended that the benefits of prophylactic aspirin outweigh the risks. However, due to high complication rates, warfarin's benefits are outweighed by the risks. This analysis has not been validated in an actual patient population and remains theoretical in nature, but is the best available evidence regarding primary prevention of venous thromboembolism for patients with aPL."
"What is the best treatment for pertussis
To investigate the value of extracorporeal circulatory life support (ECLS) in paediatric patients with severe Bordetella pertussis infection. Single case report and a review of the ECLS database. Tertiary referral hospital paediatric intensive care unit. A single case report of an infant with B. pertussis infection is described. Despite receiving ECLS, this infant died from overwhelming cardiac and cerebral insults. Outcome for children receiving ECLS registered on the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization database is reviewed. The mortality of infants receiving ECLS for B. pertussis infection is high, with only 5 survivors reported among 22 registered cases. The majority of nonsurvivors had evidence of circulatory collapse in addition to severe respiratory failure, and these patients commonly died of hypoxic-ischaemic cerebral insult. These data suggest the existence of a subgroup of patients with respiratory failure only, who may benefit from ECLS, and a larger subgroup who suffer ischaemic cardiac and cerebral insults which are unlikely to be improved by ECLS. The value of ECLS in patients with B. pertussis infection who present with major cardiac dysfunction is questionable. Such patients almost invariably have a poor outcome despite maximal therapy.",Extracorporeal circulatory life support has been used to maintain perfusion for patients with severe disease. The mortality of these patients is very high.
"What are the most effective nonpharmacologic therapies for irritable bowel syndrome
Herbal medications have been used in many countries for the treatment of patients with irritable bowel syndrome. Controlled data supporting the efficacy of these treatments in patients with irritable bowel syndrome are lacking. To assess the efficacy and safety of a commercially available herbal preparation (STW 5) (nine plant extracts), the research herbal preparation STW 5-II (six plant extracts) and the bitter candytuft mono-extract in patients with irritable bowel syndrome. Two hundred and eight patients with irritable bowel syndrome were recruited after standardized diagnostic work-up into a double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-centre trial and were randomly assigned to receive one of four treatments: commercially available herbal preparation STW 5 (n = 51), research herbal preparation STW 5-II (n = 52), bitter candytuft mono-extract (n = 53) or placebo (n = 52). The main outcome variables were the changes in total abdominal pain and irritable bowel syndrome symptom scores. Two hundred and three patients completed the trial. STW 5 and STW 5-II were significantly better than placebo in reducing the total abdominal pain score (intention-to-treat: STW 5, P = 0.0009; STW 5-II, P = 0.0005) and the irritable bowel syndrome symptom score (intention-to-treat: STW 5, P = 0.001; STW 5-II, P = 0.0003) at 4 weeks. There were no statistically significant differences between the bitter candytuft mono-extract group and the placebo group (P = 0.1473, P = 0.1207). The commercially available herbal preparation STW 5 and its research preparation STW 5-II are both effective in alleviating irritable bowel syndrome symptoms.","A multicenter randomized controlled trials compared 2 herbal formulations with placebo. The first contained extracts of bitter candy-tuft, chamomile, peppermint, caraway, and licorice. The second, a commercial preparation called Iberogast, had the same ingredients as the first, as well as lemon balm, celandine, angelica, and milk thistle. The study demonstrated global irritable bowel syndrome symptom reduction, with a relative risk [RR] of 1.68 (99% confidence interval [CI], 1.00-2.8) for Iberogast, and RR=1.90 (99% CI, 1.15-3.14) for the first formulation.

"What are the causes of hypomagnesemia
The objective of this study was to examine the relationships of serum and dietary magnesium (Mg) with prevalent cardiovascular disease (CVD), hypertension, diabetes mellitus, fasting insulin, and average carotid intimal-medial wall thickness measured by B-mode ultrasound. A cross-sectional design was used. The setting was the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study in four US communities. A total of 15,248 participants took part, male and female, black and white, aged 45-64 years. Fasting serum Mg, lipids, fasting glucose and insulin were measured; as was usual dietary intake by food frequency questionnaire and carotid intima-media thickness by standardized B-mode ultrasound methods. The results showed that serum Mg levels and dietary Mg intake were both lower in blacks than whites. Mean serum Mg levels were significantly lower in participants with prevalent CVD, hypertension, and diabetes than in those free of these diseases. In participants without CVD, serum Mg levels were also inversely associated with fasting serum insulin, glucose, systolic blood pressure and smoking. Dietary Mg intake was inversely associated with fasting serum insulin, plasma high density lipoprotein-cholesterol, systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Adjusted for age, race, body mass index, smoking, hypertension, Low density lipoprotein-cholesterol, and field center, mean carotid wall thickness increased in women by 0.0118 mm (p = 0.006) in diuretic users and 0.0048 mm (p = 0.017) in nonusers for each 0.1 mmol/l decrease in serum Mg level; the multivariate association in men was not significant. In conclusion, low serum and dietary Mg may be related to the etiologies of CVD, hypertension, diabetes, and atherosclerosis.","Estimates of the prevalence of hypomagnesemia in the general population range from 2.5% to 15%. A study of 11,000 white urban Americans aged 45 to 64 years (probability sampling) found 2.5% with magnesium <0.7 mmol/L and 5% with magnesium <0.75 mmol/L; rates for 4000 African Americans were twice as high"
"Does digoxin decrease morbidity for those in sinus rhythm with heart failure
The role of cardiac glycosides in treating patients with chronic heart failure and normal sinus rhythm remains controversial. We studied the effect of digoxin on mortality and hospitalization in a randomized, double-blind clinical trial. In the main trial, patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 0.45 or less were randomly assigned to digoxin (3397 patients) or placebo (3403 patients) in addition to diuretics and angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (median dose of digoxin, 0.25 mg per day; average follow-up, 37 months). In an ancillary trial of patients with ejection fractions greater than 0.45, 492 patients were randomly assigned to digoxin and 496 to placebo. In the main trial, mortality was unaffected. There were 1181 deaths (34.8 percent) with digoxin and 1194 deaths (35.1 percent) with placebo (risk ratio when digoxin was compared with placebo, 0.99; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.91 to 1.07; P=0.80). In the digoxin group, there was a trend toward a decrease in the risk of death attributed to worsening heart failure (risk ratio, 0.88; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.77 to 1.01; P=0.06). There were 6 percent fewer hospitalizations overall in that group than in the placebo group, and fewer patients were hospitalized for worsening heart failure (26.8 percent vs. 34.7 percent; risk ratio, 0.72; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.66 to 0.79; P<0.001). In the ancillary trial, the findings regarding the primary combined outcome of death or hospitalization due to worsening heart failure were consistent with the results of the main trial. Digoxin did not reduce overall mortality, but it reduced the rate of hospitalization both overall and for worsening heart failure. These findings define more precisely the role of digoxin in the management of chronic heart failure.","Patients receiving digoxin experienced reduced rates of hospitalization due to worsening heart failure (odds ratio [OR]=0.68; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.61-0.75; number needed to treat [NNT]=13-17) and less clinical deterioration (OR=0.31; 95% CI, 0.21-0.43; NNT=3-61). The wide range in number needed to treat for the reduction in clinical deterioration reflects varying baseline rates of worsening clinical status found among the 12 studies for patients receiving placebo. The narrow CI associated with the odds ratio for reduced rates of clinical deterioration reflects the fact that the majority of patients whose clinical status was evaluated as an outcome came from a single large study, the digoxigenin trial. This trial followed 6800 patients with new york heart association classifications I to III. Ninety-four percent of patients in this trial were additionally on angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and 82% were taking diuretics. Patients were followed for a mean of 37 months. A subgroup analysis of 988 patients with diastolic dysfunction (ejection fraction >45%) in this study suggested no clear benefits or harms when digoxin was used in combination with other therapies vs placebo; however, it did show a positive trend towards the combined outcome of reduced hospitalizations and less clinical deterioration (relative risk [RR]=0.82; 95% CI, 0.63-1.07). Increased rates of supraventricular dysrhythmias (RR=2.08; 95% CI, 1.44-2.99; number needed to harm [NNH]=77) and second- and third-degree heart block were demonstrated for patients receiving digoxin (RR=2.93; 95% CI, 1.61-5.34; NNH=125)."
"Are inhalers with spacers better than nebulizers for children with asthma
Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are common diseases of the airways and lungs that have a major impact on the health of the population. The mainstay of treatment is by inhalation of medication to the site of the disease process. This can be achieved by a number of different device types, which have wide variations in costs to the health service. A number of different inhalation devices are available. The pressurised metered-dose inhaler (pMDI) is the most commonly used and cheapest device, which may also be used in conjunction with a spacer device. Newer chlorofluorocarbons (CFC)-free inhaler devices using hydrofluoroalkanes (HFAs) have also been developed. The drug is dissolved or suspended in the propellant under pressure. When activated, a valve system releases a metered volume of drug and propellant. Other devices include breath-actuated pMDIs (BA-pMDI), such as Autohaler and Easi-Breathe. They incorporate a mechanism activated during inhalation that triggers the metered-dose inhaler. Dry powder inhalers (DPI), such as Turbohaler, Diskhaler, Accuhaler and Rotahaler, are activated by inspiration by the patient. The powdered drug is dispersed into particles by the inspiration. With nebulisers oxygen, compressed air, or ultrasonic power is used to break up solutions or suspensions of medication into droplets for inhalation. The aerosol is administered by mask or by a mouthpiece. There has been no previous systematic review of the evidence of clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of these different inhaler devices. To review systematically the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of inhaler devices in asthma and COPD. The different aspects of inhaler devices were separated into the most clinically relevant comparisons. Methods involved systematic searching of electronic databases and bibliographies for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and systematic reviews. Pharmaceutical companies and experts in the field were contacted for further information. Trials that met the inclusion criteria were appraised and data extraction was under-taken by one reviewer and checked by a second reviewer, with any discrepancies being resolved through agreement. RESULTS--IN VITRO CHARACTERISTICS VERSUS IN VIVO TESTING AND CLINICAL RESPONSE: There is evidence that when comparative testing is performed on inhaler devices using the same methods, there is some correlation between particle size measurements and clinical response. However, the measurements are dependent upon the methods used, and a single measure of a device in isolation is of limited value. Also, there is little data on comparing devices of different types. There is currently insufficient data to verify the ability of in vitro assessments to predict inhaler performance in vivo. RESULTS--EFFECTIVENESS OF METERED-DOSE INHALERS FOR THE DELIVERY OF CORTICOSTEROIDS IN ASTHMA: The review of three trials in children and 21 trials in adults demonstrated no evidence to suggest clinical benefits of any other inhaler device over a pMDI in corticosteroid delivery. RESULTS--EFFECTIVENESS OF METERED-DOSE INHALERS FOR THE DELIVERY OF BETA-AGONISTS IN STABLE ASTHMA: In children, 11 studies were reviewed, of which seven compared the Turbohaler with the pMDI. One study found a significant treatment difference in peak expiratory flow rate, although there were differences in the patients' baseline characteristics. In adults, a review of 70 studies found no demonstrable difference in the clinical bronchodilator effect of short-acting b2-agonists delivered by the standard pMDI compared with that produced by any other DPI, HFA-pMDI or the Autohaler device. The finding that HFA-pMDIs may reduce treatment failure and oral steroid requirement in beta-agonist delivery needs further confirmatory research in adequately randomised clinical trials. RESULTS--EFFECTIVENESS OF NEBULISERS VERSUS METERED-DOSE INHALERS FOR THE DELIVERY OF BRONCHODILATORS IN STABLE ASTHMA: In children, three included trials compared different devices with a nebuliser and demonstrated no evidence of clinical superiority of nebulisers over inhaler devices in bronchodilator delivery. A total of 23 studies in adults found no equivalence for the main pulmonary outcomes and no evidence of difference in other outcomes. RESULTS--EFFECTIVENESS OF METERED-DOSE INHALERS FOR THE DELIVERY OF BETA-AGONISTS IN COPD: Only two studies were included in this review. No evidence of clinical difference was found in beta-agonist delivery. RESULTS--EFFECTIVENESS OF NEBULISERS VERSUS METERED-DOSE INHALERS FOR THE DELIVERY OF BRONCHODILATORS IN COPD: Evidence from 14 trials demonstrated equivalence for the main outcomes of pulmonary function. For other outcomes there was no evidence of treatment difference in bronchodilator delivery. RESULTS--PATIENTS' ABILITY TO USE METERED-DOSE INHALERS: Differences among studies and the heterogeneity of the results make it difficult to draw conclusions about inhaler technique differences between device types. The review of technique after teaching the correct technique suggests that there is no difference in patients' ability to use DPI or pMDIs. RESULTS--ECONOMIC ANALYSIS: The total number of NHS prescriptions for inhaler therapy for asthma in 1998 was over 31 million, with a net ingredient cost in excess of 392 million GB pounds. This economic assessment uses decision analysis to estimate the relative cost-effectiveness of inhaler devices for the delivery of bronchodilator and corticosteroid inhaled therapy. Overall, there were no differences in patient outcomes among the devices. On the assumption that the devices were clinically equivalent, pMDIs were the most cost-effective devices for asthma treatment. This systematic review examined the evidence from clinical trials evaluating the clinical effectiveness of different inhaler devices in the delivery of inhaled corticosteroids and beta2-bronchodilators for patients with asthma and COPD. The evidence from the published clinical literature demonstrates no difference in clinical effectiveness between nebulisers and alternative inhaler devices compared to standard pMDI with or without a spacer device. The cost-effectiveness evidence therefore favours pMDIs (or the cheapest inhaler device) as first-line treatment in all patients with stable asthma unless other specific reasons are identified. Patients can use pMDIs as effectively as other inhaler devices as long as the correct inhalation technique is taught. CONCLUSIONS--RECOMMENDATIONS FOR RESEARCH: Further clinical trials are required to demonstrate any differences in the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of inhaler devices and nebulisers compared with pMDIs. These should be of sufficient statistical power and methodological rigour to demonstrate any clinical benefit. Trials should be undertaken in community settings to ensure the generalisability of results. Outcome measures should be more patient-centred and report adverse effects more completely. Reporting of data from trials should be improved.",A review article from the British literature examined 3 randomized controlled trials involving 51 patients and found no superiority of nebulizer vs MDI/S.
"Which vaccinations are indicated after splenectomy
To evaluate the diagnostic value of symptoms, signs, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and C reactive protein for acute maxillary sinusitis. Prospective cohort study. Danish general practice in cooperation with the otorhinolaryngology and neuroradiology department at Aalborg County Hospital. 174 patients aged 18-65 years who were suspected by the general practitioner of having acute maxillary sinusitis. The independent association of symptoms, signs, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and concentration of C reactive protein in patients with acute maxillary sinusitis defined as purulent or mucopurulent antral aspirate. Only raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate (P = 0.01) and raised C reactive protein (P = 0.007) were found to be independently associated with a diagnosis of acute maxillary sinusitis. The combination of the two variables had a sensitivity of 0.82 and a specificity of 0.57. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C reactive protein are useful diagnostic criteria for acute maxillary sinusitis.","In a study of 561 Danes, those vaccinated within 14 days of splenectomy (before or after) had a significantly higher need for revaccination than those who were vaccinated more than 14 days before or after surgery."
"Which complementary therapies can help patients with PMS
This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of St. John's wort extract (SJW) as a treatment for premenstrual symptoms. The study was a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial, with two parallel treatment groups. After a no-treatment baseline cycle, volunteers were randomized to either SJW or placebo for a further two menstrual cycles. A postal trial conducted from The University of Reading, Berkshire, England. One hundred and sixty-nine (169) normally menstruating women who experienced recurrent premenstrual symptoms were recruited onto the study. One hundred and twenty-five (125) completed the protocol and were included in the analysis. Six hundred milligrams (600) mg of SJW (standardized to contain 1800 microg of hypericin) or placebo (containing lactose and cellulose). A menstrual diary was used to assess changes in premenstrual symptoms. The anxiety-related subgroup of symptoms of this instrument was used as the primary outcome measure. After averaging the effects of treatment over both treatment cycles it was found that there was a trend for SJW to be superior to placebo. However, this finding was not statistically significant. The possibility that this nonsignificant finding resulted from insufficient statistical power in the study, rather than a lack of efficacy of SJW, is discussed. Following this discussion the recommendation is made that, in future, similar studies should be powered to detect a minimum clinically relevant difference between treatments.","One randomized, double-blind controlled trial (N=125) of 600 mg St. John's wort vs placebo over 2 cycles of treatment found no significant changes in symptom score from baseline."
"Which lab tests are best when you suspect hypothyroidism
These clinical practice guidelines summarize the recommendations of the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists for the diagnostic evaluation of hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism and for treatment strategies in patients with these disorders. The sensitive thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH or thyrotropin) assay has become the single best screening test for hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism, and in most outpatient clinical situations, the serum TSH is the most sensitive test for detecting mild thyroid hormone excess or deficiency. Therapeutic options for patients with Graves' disease include thyroidectomy (rarely used now in the United States), antithyroid drugs (frequently associated with relapses), and radioactive iodine (currently the treatment of choice). In clinical hypothyroidism, the standard treatment is levothyroxine replacement, which must be tailored to the individual patient. Awareness of subclinical thyroid disease, which often remains undiagnosed, is emphasized, as is a system of care that incorporates regular follow-up surveillance by one physician as well as education and involvement of the patient.","In primary hypothyroidism, reassess thyroid-stimulating hormone 6 weeks after the start of treatment or a change in replacement dose. This recommendation is based on the fact that levothyroxine has a half-life of about a week; a steady state would be achieved over the course of 5 half-lives. No direct patient-oriented evidence exists for this testing interval. Test free T4 if you suspect excessive replacement or noncompliance."
"When should patients with asymptomatic aortic stenosis be evaluated for valve replacement
Only limited data on the rate of hemodynamic progression and predictors of outcome in asymptomatic patients with valvular aortic stenosis (AS) are available. In 123 adults (mean age, 63 +/- 16 years) with asymptomatic AS, annual clinical, echocardiographic, and exercise data were obtained prospectively (mean follow-up of 2.5 +/- 1.4 years). Aortic jet velocity increased by 0.32 +/- 0.34 m/s per year and mean gradient by 7 +/- 7 mm Hg per year; valve area decreased by 0.12 +/- 0.19 cm2 per year. Kaplan-Meier event-free survival, with end points defined as death (n = 8) or aortic valve surgery (n = 48), was 93 +/- 5% at 1 year, 62 +/- 8% at 3 years, and 26 +/- 10% at 5 years. Univariate predictors of outcome included baseline jet velocity, mean gradient, valve area, and the rate of increase in jet velocity (all P < or = .001) but not age, sex, or cause of AS. Those with an end point had a smaller exercise increase in valve area, blood pressure, and cardiac output and a greater exercise decrease in stroke volume. Multivariate predictors of outcome were jet velocity at baseline (P < .0001), the rate of change in jet velocity (P < .0001), and functional status score (P = .002). The likelihood of remaining alive without valve replacement at 2 years was only 21 +/- 18% for a jet velocity at entry > 4.0 m/s, compared with 66 +/- 13% for a velocity of 3.0 to 4.0 m/s and 84 +/- 16% for a jet velocity < 3.0 m/s (P < .0001). In adults with asymptomatic AS, the rate of hemodynamic progression and clinical outcome are predicted by jet velocity, the rate of change in jet velocity, and functional status.","In one prospective study of 123 patients, those who had a greater increase in valve area, cardiac output, and blood pressure and a smaller decrease in stroke volume on stress echocardiogram were more likely to remain asymptomatic for the entire length of their time in the study, an average of 2.5 years."
"How effective are nasal steroids combined with nonsedating antihistamines for seasonal allergic rhinitis
The anti-inflammatory activity of corticosteroids has prompted the exploration of their use in the treatment of allergic rhinitis. The development of intranasal steroids has resulted in several agents with quick actions, localized effects, and great efficacy in the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis and the prophylactic management of perennial rhinitis. This article presents a concise review of the preclinical and clinical evidence with these new agents and provides data-based guidance for the selection of optimal agents. The survey reveals that mometasone furoate, a new inhaled steroid with topical activity, has the greatest binding affinity for the glucocorticoid receptor, followed by fluticasone propionate, budesonide, triamcinolone acetonide, and dexamethasone. Mometasone furoate also has strong anti-inflammatory activity, with IL-4 and IL-5 inhibition activities equivalent to those of fluticasone propionate. Clinically, both mometasone furoate and fluticasone propionate appear to be well tolerated, to have quick onsets of action, and to be equivalent in efficacy in the treatment of seasonal allergic and perennial rhinitis. Of the intranasal steroids currently available, mometasone furoate has been shown to have the least systemic availability and, consequently, is expected to have the fewest systemic side effects. Some suppression of overnight cortisol levels has been reported with fluticasone propionate (indicative of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression).","The newer nasal steroids such as fluticasone may be more effective because of their stronger affinities to glucocorticoid receptors, but no clinical evidence confirms this hypothesis."
"What is the best treatment for analgesic rebound headaches
To prospectively document the outcome of patients suspected of having rebound headache. Previous publications on rebound headache have, for the most part, implied that the patients improve, but have failed to specify the percent who improved, the pattern of improvement, or the end point that is achieved. This was a prospective study of 50 consecutive patients presenting with chronic daily headache of over 2 months' duration who were suspected of having rebound headache from the medications that they were using for pain relief, and who were eligible to follow our usual treatment protocol, ie, abrupt termination of the offending medications and use of subcutaneous injections of dihydroergotamine for excruciating headache. One year after the initial patient was enrolled and 8 months after the last patient was enrolled, 29 patients (58%) achieved the goal of 6 or more consecutive headache-free days; the mean time to achieve this goal was 84 days. Another 9 patients showed varying degrees of improvement; 1 continued to improve and achieved 5 consecutive headache-free days after having omitted her medications for 10 months. Eleven patients failed to stop their medications or stopped their medications for only a brief interval. One patient continued to have daily headaches after having essentially omitted all pain relief medications for 12 months and was the only true treatment failure in the group. Most patients suspected of having rebound headache comply with the instructions to omit the offending agents and can be helped. This information might help other physicians who are treating patients suspected of having rebound headache.","A case series studied 50 patients with rebound headaches for 5 or more days a week at baseline. Patients were educated regarding analgesic overuse headaches, after which their analgesics were abruptly discontinued, and they were followed up to a year. Subcutaneous dihydroergotamine was used as needed for symptomatic relief of excruciating headaches. At study completion, 78% of patients had adequately stopped analgesics. The goal of greater than 6 consecutive headache-free days was achieved in 74% patients in an average of 84 days."
"When should travelers begin malaria prophylaxis
Three hundred and fifty-nine US Marines participated in a randomized double-blind clinical trial to assess tolerance of two prophylactic mefloquine regimens [250 mg salt weekly (n = 157) or 250 mg daily for 3 days followed by 250 mg weekly (n = 46)] compared with 300 mg weekly chloroquine (n = 156) over a 12-week period. The study participants were seen daily for four days, then weekly for 11 weeks. On each visit, the subject answered two computerized questionnaires (a review of body systems and an evaluation of mood states), participated in a physician interview, and was administered medications under supervision. A random sample of each group was assigned to either pharmacokinetic sampling or two wear a wrist watch size computerized sleep monitor (actigraph). The frequencies of intercurrent illness and other concomitant medications were tabulated. End study mefloquine plasma levels were obtained on all study participants. The results obtained showed no compromise in function due to dizziness or incoordination in the mefloquine groups. Overall, both weekly mefloquine and loading dose mefloquine were well tolerated. Sleep disturbance and increased dream activity were detected in the mefloquine groups. Depressive feelings were noted in two to three times more individuals in the mefloquine groups than in the chloroquine group early in the course of the study, and resolved in the majority of subjects as tolerance developed. Steady state mefloquine plasma levels were attained rapidly with the loading dose regimen in four days versus seven weeks with weekly mefloquine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","In contrast to the pretreatment times for all other malarial prophylaxes, the generally accepted pretreatment time for mefloquine is 1 to 2 weeks before entering a risk area. However, this may still be inadequate due to the drug's long half-life, which results in a long delay in reaching therapeutic blood levels. The evidence indicates that mefloquine should be started at least 2, and as many as 7, weeks before travel."
"How useful is ultrasound to evaluate patients with postmenopausal bleeding
Postmenopausal vaginal bleeding is a common clinical problem. Endovaginal ultrasound (EVUS) is a noninvasive diagnostic test that may help determine which women should undergo endometrial biopsy. To determine the accuracy of EVUS in detecting endometrial disease in postmenopausal women with vaginal bleeding according to hormone replacement use. Literature search of English-language and non-English-language articles published from 1966 through November 1996 using MEDLINE and by a manual search of bibliographies of published articles. Studies were included if they prospectively collected EVUS measurements of endometrial thickness prior to obtaining endometrial tissue for histologic evaluation in postmenopausal women with vaginal bleeding. Of 85 studies that included data on EVUS and endometrial histology, 35 were included in the meta-analysis and included 5892 women. Articles were reviewed and independently selected and abstracted by 2 reviewers. Disagreement was resolved by consensus. The overall summary mean weighted estimates of sensitivity and specificity were calculated for thresholds of endometrial thickness from 3 to 10 mm. Using a 5-mm threshold to define abnormal endometrial thickening, 96% (95% confidence interval [CI], 94%-98%) of women with cancer had an abnormal EVUS result, whereas 92% (95% CI, 90%-93%) of women with endometrial disease (cancer, polyp, or atypical hyperplasia) had an abnormal result. This did not vary by hormone replacement use. However, the number of women with normal histology who had an abnormal EVUS result did vary by hormone replacement use. In women who were not using hormone replacement therapy, 593 (8%) with normal histological findings had an abnormal EVUS result (specificity, 92%; 95% CI, 90%-94%), whereas 1544 (23%) using hormone replacement therapy had an abnormal EVUS result (specificity, 77%; 95% CI, 75%-79%). For a postmenopausal woman with vaginal bleeding with a 10% pretest probability of endometrial cancer, her probability of cancer is 1% following a normal EVUS result. Endovaginal ultrasound has a high sensitivity for detecting endometrial cancer and other endometrial disease and can reliably identify postmenopausal women with vaginal bleeding who are highly unlikely to have significant endometrial disease so that endometrial sampling may be unnecessary.","A 1998 meta-analysis of 35 exploratory cohort studies published between 1966 and 1996 included a total of 5892 women with postmenopausal bleeding. transvaginal ultrasound evaluations were followed by endometrial tissue sampling and results were compared. Using endometrial thickness of ≤5 mm as the threshold, ultrasound was very accurate at ruling out patients with endometrial cancer but only fair at diagnosing cancer (likelihood ratio for a positive test [LR+]=2.5; likelihood ratio for a negative test [LR-]=0.06). In addition, the 5-mm threshold was accurate at ruling out any endometrial abnormality (cancer, polyp, atypical hyperplasia: LR- = 0.01). The authors suggested that transvaginal ultrasound can reliably rule out significant endometrial disease among postmenopausal women with vaginal bleeding."
"What is the risk of adverse outcomes in a woman who develops mild hypertension from OCs
In a survey of 461 women routinely attending family planning clinics, those taking oral contraceptives had significantly higher mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures than those using non-hormonal contraception.  There appeared to be a dose-response relation of blood pressure to the progestogen component of 2 oral contraceptives with an identical 30 micrograms ethinylestradiol component.  This supports the idea that the progestogen as well as the estrogen component has an etiological role in the rise in blood pressure.  There was a significant correlation of blood pressure with duration of current use of oral contraceptive but not with total duration of use.  There was also a significant negative correlation of blood pressure with time since oral contraceptives were last taken, and women who had stopped using oral contraceptives over a month previously had similar blood pressures to those who had never taken them.  In women taking oral contraceptives, those who had either a history of hypertension in pregnancy or a family history of hypertension had significantly higher mean blood pressures than those who did not.  Both systolic and diastolic blood pressures correlated independently with weight and body mass index, but controlling for the effect of this and age did not affect the above relations.  No significant differences in mean blood pressures were found between different ethnic groups, and there was no relation of blood pressure to reported marital state, social class, parity, smoking, or alcohol use.",A survey study of 461 women attending family planning clinics found that mean blood pressures were significantly higher for those taking OCs than for those using nonhormonal contraception. Elevated blood pressures correlated with duration of current use of OCs but returned to normal soon after stopping OCs. The mean pressures of those who had stopped OCs more than a month were similar to those of women who had never taken an oral contraceptive and significantly lower than those of women who were currently taking OCs.
"What's the best way to manage athletes with amenorrhea
Women have become increasingly physically active in recent decades. While exercise provides substantial health benefits, intensive exercise is also associated with a unique set of risks for the female athlete. Hypothalamic dysfunction associated with strenuous exercise, and the resulting disturbance of GnRH pulsatility, can result in delayed menarche and disruption of menstrual cyclicity. Specific mechanisms triggering reproductive dysfunction may vary across athletic disciplines. An energy drain incurred by women whose energy expenditure exceeds dietary energy intake appears to be the primary factor effecting GnRH suppression in athletes engaged in sports emphasizing leanness; nutritional restriction may be an important causal factor in the hypoestrogenism observed in these athletes. A distinct hormonal profile characterized by hyperandrogenism rather than hypoestrogenism is associated with athletes engaged in sports emphasizing strength over leanness. Complications associated with suppression of GnRH include infertility and compromised bone density. Failure to attain peak bone mass and bone loss predispose hypoestrogenic athletes to osteopenia and osteoporosis. Metabolic aberrations associated with nutritional insult may be the primary factors effecting low bone density in hypoestrogenic athletes, thus diagnosis should include careful screening for abnormal eating behavior. Increasing caloric intake to offset high energy demand may be sufficient to reverse menstrual dysfunction and stimulate bone accretion. Treatment with exogenous estrogen may help to curb further bone loss in the hypoestrogenic amenorrheic athlete, but may not be sufficient to stimulate bone growth. Treatment aimed at correcting metabolic abnormalities may in fact prove more effective than that aimed at correcting estrogen deficiencies.","No published study has demonstrated clinically significant advantages for oral contraceptive therapy in women with secondary amenorrhea. These women should take adequate calcium and vitamin D. Bisphosphonates are not appropriate for women of reproductive age, because of their potential teratogenicity."
"How should you manage an overweight breastfed infant
Filmed records of an entire feeding session of a population of breast-and bottle-fed human infants were made at approximately 1-month intervals. The occurence of maternal and infant behavior is related to the infant's birth weight during the first week of life only in bottle-fed infants; the greater the mother's response, the less the small infant consumes. There are clear behavioral differences between bottle- and breast-feeding which stem from inherent characteristics of the technique of feeding. Breast-feeding allows the infant to have more control during the feed, whereas in the bottle-feeding, the mother has more control. This concept of control is discussed in terms of its implications for somatic growth and the development of obesity in relation to the advice and training of health professionals.",Overfeeding may contribute to higher-than-normal weight gain in both breastfed and formula-fed infants.
"Menstrual disturbances in perimenopausal women: What's best
Excessively heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) or menorrhagia is an important cause of ill health in women. Eighty per cent of women treated for HMB have no anatomical pathology, which makes medical therapy, with the avoidance of possibly unnecessary surgery, an attractive alternative. Of the wide variety of medications used to reduce heavy menstrual bleeding, oral progestogens are the most commonly prescribed. This review assesses the effectiveness of two different regimens of oral progestogens in reducing ovulatory HMB. The primary objective of this review was to investigate the effectiveness of oral progestogen therapy taken either during the luteal phase or for a longer course of 21 days in achieving a reduction in menstrual blood loss in women of reproductive years with heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB). We searched the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Trials Register (searched April 2007), MEDLINE (1966 to April 2007) and EMBASE (1985 to April 2007). Attempts were also made to identify trials from citation lists of review articles. In most cases, the first author of each included trial was contacted. The inclusion criteria were randomised comparisons of oral progestogen therapy versus placebo or other medical treatments in women of reproductive years with regular heavy periods measured either objectively or subjectively and with no pathological or iatrogenic causes for their heavy menstrual blood loss. Seven randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were identified that fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The review authors extracted the data independently. Odds ratios for dichotomous outcomes and weighted mean differences for continuous outcomes were estimated from the data. No RCTs comparing progestogen treatment with placebo were identified. Comparisons between oral progestogens and other medical therapies were assessed separately according to dosage regimen.Progestogen therapy during the luteal phase was significantly less effective at reducing menstrual blood loss when compared with tranexamic acid, danazol and the progesterone-releasing intrauterine system (IUS). Duration of menstruation was significantly longer with the progesterone IUS when compared with oral progestogen therapy but significantly shorter with danazol treatment. Adverse events were significantly more likely with danazol when compared with progestogen treatment. Progestogen therapy from day 5 to day 26 of the menstrual cycle was significantly less effective at reducing menstrual blood loss than the IUS. A significantly higher proportion of norethisterone (NET) patients taking progestogens found their treatment unacceptable compared to IUS patients. However, the adverse effects of breast tenderness and intermenstrual bleeding were more likely in women with the IUS. Progestogens administered from day 15 or 19 to day 26 of the cycle offer no advantage over other medical therapies such as danazol, tranexamic acid, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and the IUS in the treatment of menorrhagia in women with ovulatory cycles. Progestogen therapy for 21 days of the cycle results in a significant reduction in menstrual blood loss, although women found the treatment less acceptable than intrauterine levonorgestrel. This regimen of progestogen may have a role in the short-term treatment of menorrhagia.",A Cochrane review examined the use of cyclical progestogens (given from 10 to 20 days per cycle) for heavy menstrual bleeding. Cyclical progestogens appeared comparable in efficacy to NSAIDs for their effect on duration of menstruation; no statistically significant difference in menstrual blood loss was noted. Progestogens given in more continuous regimens offered greater benefit in terms of blood loss.
"Do OTC remedies relieve cough in acute URIs
To compare the effects of a single nocturnal dose of buckwheat honey or honey-flavored dextromethorphan (DM) with no treatment on nocturnal cough and sleep difficulty associated with childhood upper respiratory tract infections. A survey was administered to parents on 2 consecutive days, first on the day of presentation when no medication had been given the prior evening and then the next day when honey, honey-flavored DM, or no treatment had been given prior to bedtime according to a partially double-blinded randomization scheme. A single, outpatient, general pediatric practice. One hundred five children aged 2 to 18 years with upper respiratory tract infections, nocturnal symptoms, and illness duration of 7 days or less. A single dose of buckwheat honey, honey-flavored DM, or no treatment administered 30 minutes prior to bedtime. Cough frequency, cough severity, bothersome nature of cough, and child and parent sleep quality. Significant differences in symptom improvement were detected between treatment groups, with honey consistently scoring the best and no treatment scoring the worst. In paired comparisons, honey was significantly superior to no treatment for cough frequency and the combined score, but DM was not better than no treatment for any outcome. Comparison of honey with DM revealed no significant differences. In a comparison of honey, DM, and no treatment, parents rated honey most favorably for symptomatic relief of their child's nocturnal cough and sleep difficulty due to upper respiratory tract infection. Honey may be a preferable treatment for the cough and sleep difficulty associated with childhood upper respiratory tract infection. clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00127686.","In a partially double-blinded randomized controlled trials (the ""no treatment"" group was not blinded) of 105 children, a single dose of buckwheat honey decreased cough frequency, as assessed by parents, by 1.89 points on the 7-point Likert scale compared with DM (1.39) and no treatment (0.92; P<.001). Overall improvement in symptom score averaged 10.71 out of a total 30 points for honey compared with 6.41 for no treatment (P=.04). Cough frequency and overall symptom scores for DM did not differ significantly from no treatment. Hyperactivity, nervousness, and insomnia were reported more often with honey (5 patients) than DM (2 patients) or no treatment (0 patients); (P=.04)."
"Can nonantidepressants help treat depression
To examine the efficacy and overall tolerability of augmentation of standard antidepressants with atypical antipsychotic agents for treatment-resistant major depressive disorder. MEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane database, and program syllabi from major psychiatric meetings held since 2000 as well as a number of online clinical trial results registries were searched. Makers of atypical anti-psychotic agents who do not maintain an online clinical study results registry were contacted directly. Double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials assessing adjunctive treatment of standard antidepressants with an atypical antipsychotic agent for treatment-resistant major depressive disorder were identified. Data were extracted with the use of a pre-coded form. Data from 10 clinical trial reports involving a total of 1500 outpatients with treatment-resistant major depressive disorder were identified and combined using a random-effects model. Patients randomized to adjunctive treatment with an atypical antipsychotic agent were more likely to experience remission (risk ratio [RR] = 1.75, p < .0001) or clinical response (RR = 1.35, p = .001) than patients who received adjunctive placebo. Pooled remission and response rates for the 2 treatment groups were 47.4% vs. 22.3% and 57.2% vs. 35.4%, respectively. Although there was no difference in overall discontinuation rates (p = .929) or the rate of discontinuation due to inefficacy (p = .133) between the 2 treatment groups, the rate of discontinuation due to adverse events was lower among placebo-treated patients (RR = 3.38, p < .0001). These results support the utility of augmenting standard antidepressants with atypical antipsychotic agents for treatment-resistant major depressive disorder. An obvious limitation of this work is the absence of data focusing on the use of aripiprazole and ziprasidone. Future short- as well as long-term studies comparing the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of this versus other adjunctive strategies are warranted.","A meta-analysis of 10 clinical trials involving 1500 outpatients studied the efficacy of augmenting standard antidepressants with atypical antipsychotic agents to treat resistant major depressive disorder. Across the trials, the pooled risk ratio (RR) for remission was 1.75 (95% CI, 1.36-2.24) and for response rates was 1.35 (95% CI, 1.13-1.63). Pooled rates for remission and response were 47.4% vs 22.3% (NNT=4) and 57.2% vs 35.4% (NNT=4.6), respectively. Although the meta-analysis found no difference in overall discontinuation rates (P=.929), the rate of discontinuation because of adverse events was lower among placebo-treated patients (RR=3.38, P<.0001). These results suggest a role for atypical antipsychotic agents in augmenting standard antidepressants for treatment-resistant major depressive disorder."
"How effective is gastric bypass for weight loss
There are no longitudinal data that address weight loss stability and lipid levels in bariatric surgical patients. The goal of this study was to determine whether weight regain adversely affected reduction in lipid levels after gastric bariatric operations. Of 651 consecutive patients undergoing gastric restrictive surgery for morbid obesity, 227 (35%) had increased serum levels of total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides, or both preoperatively. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels were subnormal (</=35 mg/dl) in 45 (20%) of the hyperlipidemic patients. Fasting lipid profiles were determined at 6-month intervals postoperatively. This series included the following three operations: gastroplasty (GP; N = 13), standard Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB; N = 205), and distal Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (DRY; N = 9). By 6 months postoperatively, patients had a >/=15% mean reduction in TC and a >/=50% mean reduction in triglycerides, both of which were significant in comparison with preoperative levels (P </=0.05). Mean HDL-C levels had increased significantly vs. preoperative levels by 12 months postoperative y (P <0.05) and continued to increase through 5 years. By 18 months both HDL-C and TC were significantly lower after DRY than after GP or RYGB. In 91 patients who were followed for 2 years or longer (mean 48 +/- 25 months), mean excess weight loss was 55% with mean body mass index reduced from 48 to 33 kg/m(2). This group was divided into patients whose weight remained stable (N = 54) and patients who regained >/=15% of their lost weight or lost less than 50% of excess weight (N = 37). Although mean excess weight loss and body mass index were significantly different between the two groups (P <0.0001) at 2 years, there was no difference in the lipid profile (TC/HDL) between the two groups at any interval through 5 years. These results show that abnormal lipid profiles can be permanently improved after gastric bariatric surgery and are not adversely affected by mediocre weight loss or regaining >/=15% of lost weight. DRY appears to be a superior operation for TC reduction in comparison with GP and RYGB.","In a case series, bariatric surgery reduced triglycerides (50%) as well as total cholesterol (15%) (P<.05 for both) at 6 months and significantly increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels at 1 and 5 years."
"Is the ThinPrep better than conventional Pap smear at detecting cervical cancer
To model the impact of increasing screening compliance or implementing liquid-based cytology in populations with known compliance patterns and risk profiles on rates of detection of cervical precancers. An adaptation of a time-varying Markov model was used to follow a theoretic cohort of 100,000 women from age 20 through age 80. Separate analyses of all women, white, and black women were completed using three compliance rates (self-reported, Healthy People 2000, and Healthy People 2010 compliance) and two Papanicolaou test sensitivities (conventional Papanicolaou smear and liquid-based cytology). All populations benefited from both increased compliance and liquid-based cytology use. Increasing compliance to Healthy People 2010 goals resulted in 23%, 21.7%, and 17% reductions in cervical cancer incidence for all women, white, and black women, respectively. Substituting liquid-based cytology for traditional Papanicolaou smear collection and processing with no change in compliance resulted in 32%, 32%, and 33% reductions in cervical cancer incidence for the same three subpopulations. In addition, cost-effectiveness of the liquid-based technology indirectly related to the risk profile of the population: for black women, the cost-effectiveness ratio was $10,335 per life year saved, whereas for white women, the ratio was $17,967 per life year saved. Using liquid-based cytology in all populations would be cost-effective in improving outcomes from cervical cancer. In high-risk populations, this new technology may represent the most cost-effective approach to improve cervical cancer outcomes.",A modeled cost and outcomes analysis concluded that liquid-based cytology falls within the accepted ranges of cost-effectiveness if used at 3-year screening intervals.
"How accurate is the use of ECGs in the diagnosis of myocardial infarct
We sought to determine whether the prehospital electrocardiogram (ECG) improves the diagnosis of an acute coronary syndrome. The ECG is the most widely used screening test for evaluating patients with chest pain. Prehospital and in-hospital ECGs were obtained in 3,027 consecutive patients with symptoms of suspected acute myocardial infarction, 362 of whom were randomized to prehospital versus hospital thrombolysis and 2,665 of whom did not participate in the randomized trial. Prehospital and hospital records were abstracted for clinical characteristics and diagnostic outcome. ST segment and T and Q wave abnormalities suggestive of myocardial ischemia or infarction were more common on both the prehospital and hospital ECGs of patients with as compared with those without acute coronary syndromes (p < or = 0.00001). Those with prehospital thrombolysis were more likely to show resolution of ST segment elevation by the time of hospital admission (14% vs. 5% in patients treated in the hospital, p = 0.004). In patients not considered for prehospital thrombolysis, both persistent and transient ST segment and T or Q wave abnormalities discriminated those with from those without acute coronary ischemia or infarction. Compared with ST segment elevation on a single ECG, added consideration of dynamic changes in ST segment elevation between serial ECGs improved the sensitivity for an acute coronary syndrome from 34% to 46% and reduced specificity from 96% to 93% (both p < 0.00004). Overall, compared with abnormalities observed on a single ECG, consideration of serial evolution in ST segment, T or Q wave or left bundle branch block (LBBB) abnormalities between the prehospital and initial hospital ECG improved the diagnostic sensitivity for an acute coronary syndrome from 80% to 87%, with a fall in specificity from 60% to 50% (both p < 0.000006). ECG abnormalities are an early manifestation of acute coronary syndromes and can be identified by the prehospital ECG. Compared with a single ECG, the additional effect of evolving ST segment, T or Q waves or LBBB between serially obtained prehospital and hospital ECGs enhanced the diagnosis of acute coronary syndromes, but with a fall in specificity.","As part of the Myocardial Infarction Triage and Intervention Project, the investigators found that when compared with a single ECG, serial exams increased the diagnostic sensitivity for acute coronary syndrome from ~34% to 46% with a reduction in specificity from 96% to 93% and positive predictive value from 88% to 84%. This particular study was unusual in that it used the hospital discharge diagnosis to define the outcome. In most other studies, cardiac enzymes were used as the gold standard for defining outcome."
"Do antibiotics interfere with the efficacy of oral contraceptives
With the exception of rifampin-like drugs, there is a lack of scientific evidence supporting the ability of commonly prescribed antibiotics, including all those routinely employed in outpatient dentistry, to either reduce blood levels and/or the effectiveness of oral contraceptives. To date, all clinical trials studying the effects of concomitant antibiotic therapy (with the exception of rifampin and rifabutin) have failed to demonstrate an interaction. Like all drugs, oral contraceptives are not 100% effective with the failure rate in the typical United States population reported to be as high as 3%. It is thus possible that the case reports of unintended pregnancies during antibiotic therapy may simply represent the normal failure rate of these drugs. Considering that both drug classes are prescribed frequently to women of childbearing potential, one would expect a much higher rate of oral contraceptive failure in this group of patients if a true drug:drug interaction existed. On the other hand, if the interaction does exist but is a relatively rare event, occurring in, say, 1 in 5000 women, clinical studies such as those described in this article would not detect the interaction. The pharmacokinetic studies of simultaneous antibiotic and oral contraceptive ingestion, and the retrospective studies of pregnancy rates among oral contraceptive users exposed to antibiotics, all suffer from one potential common weakness, i.e., their relatively small sample size. Sample sizes in the pharmacokinetic trials ranged from 7 to 24 participants, whereas the largest retrospective study of pregnancy rates still evaluated less than 800 total contraceptive users. Still, the incidence of such a rare interaction would not differ from the accepted normal failure rate of oral contraceptive therapy. The medico-legal ramifications of what looks like at best a rare interaction remains somewhat ""murky."" On one hand, we have medico-legal experts advising the profession to exercise caution and warn all oral contraceptive users of a potential reduction in efficacy during antibiotic therapy. These opinions are not evidence-based and rely heavily on one or two legal proceedings that cannot even be substantiated. On the other hand, there is one recently published legal proceeding in which the outcome was in favor of the oral surgeon. There is clearly a need for additional scientific research in oral contraceptive users that incorporates larger sample sizes, different time courses (prophylactic use versus standard 7-10 day use versus extended use), and different delivery systems (systemic administration versus local-controlled delivery) of antibiotic therapy. Though experts on this topic still recommend informing oral contraceptive users of the potential for a rare interaction, and for clinicians to advise them to employ additional barrier techniques of birth control during antibiotic therapy and for at least 1 week beyond the last dose [40], it is hoped that a set of guidelines regarding this controversy will eventually be published that is evidence-based, and not solely the results of anecdotal reports, expert opinions, and legal proceedings.","Multiple studies have looked at oral contraceptive serum levels with and without antibiotic treatment. These studies show that the coadministration of antibiotics (ampicillin, tetracycline, doxycycline, metronidazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin, temafloxacin, fluconazole, ciprofloxacin, or ofloxacin) did not reduce serum levels of either the estrogen or progestin components of the oral contraceptives. Rifampin is a potent inducer of the cytochrome P450 system, capable of reducing serum estrogen and progestin levels, and a small-scale study has suggested breakthrough ovulation among 2 of 9 women taking oral contraceptives and rifampin."
"What is the best treatment for oral thrush in healthy infants
Infection with Candida albicans in the breastfeeding dyad has been associated with extreme pain in the breastfeeding mother and may lead to premature weaning. There is presently a dearth of information on diagnosis, natural history, and treatment of this condition in the literature. Therefore, before such a trial was conducted, a survey was sent to experts in the field of lactation, the members of The Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine, on the diagnosis and treatment of thrush in the breastfeeding mother and baby. Results showed that the majority of respondents relied primarily on history and physical examination of the baby, but not the mother, to make the diagnosis. Laboratory tests were ordered only rarely. The most common initial treatment was oral nystatin for the infant and cream for the mother's breasts. This was followed by oral nystatin for the infant and oral fluconazole for the mother. Treatment of recurrence or persistence was again most commonly nystatin for both mother and infant, followed by oral nystatin for the infant and oral fluconazole for the mother or oral fluconazole for both. In the absence of controlled trials of this condition, these results may serve as suggestions for the clinician, until definitive data are available.",Nystatin has proved less effective than either miconazole gel or oral fluconazole.
"Does a high-fiber diet prevent colon cancer in at-risk patients
Some epidemiological studies have suggested that high dietary intake of calcium and fibre reduces colorectal carcinogenesis. Available data are not sufficient to serve as a basis for firm dietary advice. We undertook a multicentre randomised trial to test the effect of diet supplementation with calcium and fibre on adenoma recurrence. We randomly assigned 665 patients with a history of colorectal adenomas to three treatment groups, in a parallel design: calcium gluconolactate and carbonate (2 g elemental calcium daily), fibre (3.5 g ispaghula husk), or placebo. Participants had colonoscopy after 3 years of follow-up. The primary endpoint was adenoma recurrence. Analyses were by intention to treat. 23 patients died, 15 were lost to follow-up, 45 refused repeat colonoscopy, and five developed severe contraindications to colonoscopy. Among the 552 participants who completed the follow-up examination, 94 stopped treatment early. At least one adenoma developed in 28 (15.9%) of 176 patients in the calcium group, 58 (29.3%) of 198 in the fibre group, and 36 (20.2%) of 178 in the placebo group. The adjusted odds ratio for recurrence was 0.66 (95% CI 0.38-1.17; p=0.16) for calcium treatment and 1.67 (1.01-2.76, p=0.042) for the fibre treatment. The odds ratio associated with the fibre treatment was significantly higher in participants with baseline dietary calcium intake above the median than in those with intake below the median (interaction test, p=0.028) Supplementation with fibre as ispaghula husk may have adverse effects on colorectal adenoma recurrence, especially in patients with high dietary calcium intake. Calcium supplementation was associated with a modest but not significant reduction in the risk of adenoma recurrence.","In a trial of ispaghula husk fiber, the intervention group actually had significantly more recurrent adenomas after 3 years 29.3% vs 20.2%; RR=1.67; 95% CI, 1.01-2.76; P=.04."
"What treatments prevent miscarriage after recurrent pregnancy loss
The present study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of paternal lymphocyte (PL) immunotherapy and its relation with the development of mixed lymphocyte reaction blocking antibodies (MLR-Bf) and the success of pregnancy outcome in women with recurrent spontaneous abortion (RSA). A total of 124 women with unknown causes of abortions was registered for immunotherapy under double blind randomized trial by using the list of computer-generated numbers. Each 5 x 10(6) autologous lymphocyte (AL), third party lymphocyte (TPL) and PL was dissolved separately in 1 ml of sterile normal saline (NS). Each 1 ml of cell suspension and neat NS was injected in women with RSA through intramuscular (250 microl), intradermal (250 microl), subcutaneous (250 microl) and intravenous (250 microl) routes. All women participants with RSA received six identical immunizations at the regular interval of 4 weeks, and were then screened for the development of MLR-Bf after the completion of immunization course, and also at the first, second and third trimesters (12th, 24th and 36th weeks) of pregnancy. However, nonimmunized MLR-Bf positive women with RSA did not receive any kind of therapy (NT) and were used as one of the control group in the present study. We have observed that PL-immunized women with RSA showed a significantly increased level of MLR-Bf (>30) and pregnancy success (84%) as compared to those women with RSA who received either AL (33%), TPL (31%), NS (25%) or those who did not receive any kind of treatment (NT, 44%; P<0.001). Our results indicated the importance of immunotherapy with PL in women with RSA and also showed that MLR-Bf can be considered as one of the important factors for pregnancy improvement.",An randomized controlled trials evaluating paternal leukocyte immunization (32 patients) vs placebo (19 patients) among women with unexplained primary recurrent spontaneous abortion did find significantly higher birth rates with paternal leukocyte immunization (84% vs 25%; P=.001). This small study used different techniques than previous paternal leukocyte immunization studies.
"What measures relieve postherpetic neuralgia
A systematic review of the literature on postherpetic neuralgia was performed. The authors identified studies using the National Library of Medicine's Medline database and Cochrane Library database. The authors determined absolute reduction rate, number needed to treat (NNT), 95% CI for NNT, and number needed to harm (NNH) for successful therapies of postherpetic neuralgia. Tricyclic antidepressants, gabapentin, pregabalin, opioids, and lidocaine patch were found to be effective in reducing the pain of postherpetic neuralgia.","Capsaicin, a topical counterirritant, reduced pain in fewer than 20% of patients in 2 RCTs reported in systematic reviews, with an number needed to treat of 3.26 (95% CI, 2.26-5.85). Blinding was limited in these studies because of the stinging associated with treatment."
"Do statins cause myopathy
To review rhabdomyolysis and discuss the role of hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) and their interactions with other agents in precipitating this condition, and to present case reports of statin-induced rhabdomyolysis. Relevant clinical literature was accessed using MEDLINE (January 1985-October 2000). The following search terms were used: rhabdomyolysis, adverse events, drug interactions, statins, and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. Rhabdomyolysis occurs when extensive muscle damage results in the release of cellular contents into systemic circulation. Major complications include acute renal failure, cardiac abnormalities, and compartment syndrome. Treatment of rhabdomyolysis is supportive, with the primary aim of preventing renal and cardiac complications. Statin monotherapy or combination therapy may result in myopathy, which rarely progresses to rhabdomyolysis. The mechanism for drug interactions with the statins involves their property of lipid or water solubility. This characteristic determines the degree of hepatoenteric or renal metabolism of the statins. All statins except pravastatin undergo metabolism via the cytochrome P450 enzyme system. Other pharmacologic agents that are also metabolized via this pathway may interact with the statins and cause rhabdomyolysis. The risk of statin-induced rhabdomyolysis is increased significantly when statins are used concomitantly with such drugs as fibrates, cyclosporine, macrolide antibiotics, and azole antifungals. Rhabdomyolysis is a rare but clinically important adverse event of statin monotherapy or combination therapy. Thorough understanding of this condition may help prevent or minimize adverse health outcomes in patents receiving statin therapy.",A tabular analysis of 74 published case reports of statin-associated rhabdomyolysis from a MEDLINE search covering 1985 to 2000 reported that in most cases the statin was safely restarted after stopping presumed interactive drugs (exact numbers not reported).
"Does warfarin prevent deep venous thrombosis in high-risk patients
To assess the length of oral anticoagulant therapy (short versus long duration) after a first episode of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials, comparing two durations of anticoagulation, identified in 1999 by a computerized search of the Cochrane Controlled Trial Register, Medline and Embase, completed by an extensive review of the references of pertinent articles. The meta-analysis was performed on literature data. Seven published controlled trials were included. Relative risks with 95% confidence intervals were computed using the relative risk logarithm method. Statistical significance was set up at 0.01 for the test of association. Outcomes are major haemorrhage and recurrence after a 12-month follow-up. For the recurrence end-point (sample size of 2304 patients), a duration treatment of 12-24 weeks seems preferable to a 3-6 week regimen, with a relative risk (RR) of 0.60 (95% CI: 0.45-0.79, P < 0.001). For the major haemorrhage end-point (1823 patients), the RR is not significantly different from 1 (RR = 1.43, 95% CI: 0.51-4.01, P = 0. 5). The results were similar for the subgroup 'permanent risk factors' or 'idiopathic VTE' (RR for recurrence = 0.48, 95% CI: 0. 34-0.68, P < 0.001). The tendency was similar, although not reaching statistical significance, for the 'temporary risk factors' subgroup (RR for recurrence = 0.34, 95% CI: 0.13-0.93, P = 0.035). After a first episode of VTE, a long-term treatment regimen allows a significant reduction in the incidence of recurrences without increasing the incidence of bleeding events.","A meta-analysis found treatment with warfarin for 12 to 24 weeks decreased deep venous thrombosis recurrence compared with 2- to 6-week regimens relative risk [RR]=0.60; 95% CI, 0.45-0.79; NNT=21."
"How do you evaluate macrocytosis without anemia
The most common causes of macrocytic anemias in the adults are (1) alcoholism, (2) liver diseases, (3) hemolysis or bleeding, (4) hypothyroidism, (5) folate or vitamin B12 deficiency, (6) exposure to chemotherapy and other drugs, and (7) myelodysplasia. A carefully obtained history and examination with evaluation of a peripheral blood smear and reticulocyte count should be performed in most patients with macrocytosis. Serum vitamin B12 and folate levels, serum thyroid studies, liver function studies, and bone marrow aspirate and biopsy with cytogenetic analysis are frequently required to confirm a diagnosis suspected on the basis of the initial evaluation.","The causes of macrocytosis vary depending on the population studied. In primary care, alcohol use and vitamin deficiency are common causes. Even after evaluation, approximately 10% of cases remain unexplained."
"Do acetaminophen and an nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs combined relieve osteoarthritis pain better than either alone
Atherosclerosis is a process with inflammatory features and selective cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) inhibitors may potentially have antiatherogenic effects by virtue of inhibiting inflammation. However, by decreasing vasodilatory and antiaggregatory prostacyclin production, COX-2 antagonists may lead to increased prothrombotic activity. To define the cardiovascular effects of COX-2 inhibitors when used for arthritis and musculoskeletal pain in patients without coronary artery disease, we performed a MEDLINE search to identify all English-language articles on use of COX-2 inhibitors published between 1998 and February 2001. We also reviewed relevant submissions to the US Food and Drug Administration by pharmaceutical companies. Our search yielded 2 major randomized trials, the Vioxx Gastrointestinal Outcomes Research Study (VIGOR; 8076 patients) and the Celecoxib Long-term Arthritis Safety Study (CLASS; 8059 patients), as well as 2 smaller trials with approximately 1000 patients each. The results from VIGOR showed that the relative risk of developing a confirmed adjudicated thrombotic cardiovascular event (myocardial infarction, unstable angina, cardiac thrombus, resuscitated cardiac arrest, sudden or unexplained death, ischemic stroke, and transient ischemic attacks) with rofecoxib treatment compared with naproxen was 2.38 (95% confidence interval, 1.39-4.00; P =.002). There was no significant difference in cardiovascular event (myocardial infarction, stroke, and death) rates between celecoxib and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents in CLASS. The annualized myocardial infarction rates for COX-2 inhibitors in both VIGOR and CLASS were significantly higher than that in the placebo group of a recent meta-analysis of 23 407 patients in primary prevention trials (0.52%): 0.74% with rofecoxib (P =.04 compared with the placebo group of the meta-analysis) and 0.80% with celecoxib (P =.02 compared with the placebo group of the meta-analysis). The available data raise a cautionary flag about the risk of cardiovascular events with COX-2 inhibitors. Further prospective trial evaluation may characterize and determine the magnitude of the risk.",A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials found a higher incidence of serious thrombotic cardiovascular events among patients taking COX-2 inhibitors compared with naprosyn. The safety profile of rofecoxib and celecoxib in the long-term treatment of pain is not fully understood at this time.
"What are the most effective nonpharmacologic therapies for irritable bowel syndrome
Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional gastrointestinal disorder characterized by abdominal pain, distension, and an altered bowel habit for which no cause can be found. Despite its prevalence, there remains a significant lack of efficacious medical treatments for IBS to date. In this paper we reviewed a total of 14 published studies (N=644) on the efficacy of hypnosis in treating IBS (8 with no control group and 6 with a control group). We concluded that hypnosis consistently produces significant results and improves the cardinal symptoms of IBS in the majority of patients, as well as positively affecting non-colonic symptoms. When evaluated according to the efficacy guidelines of the Clinical Psychology Division of American Psychological Association, the use of hypnosis with IBS qualifies for the highest level of acceptance as being both efficacious and specific. In reviewing the research on the mechanism of action as to how hypnosis works to reduce symptoms of IBS, some evidence was found to support both physiological and psychological mechanisms of action.","A systematic review found 6 studies with a control and 8 without, for a total of 644 patients. An average of 80% of the patients reported global irritable bowel syndrome symptom relief. Patients with typical irritable bowel syndrome responded to hypnosis; however, males with diarrhea-predominant symptoms, and all subjects with atypical symptoms or comorbid psychopathology were less likely to respond."
"What treatments work best for constipation in children
To assess the efficacy of polyethylene glycol 3350 plus electrolytes (PEG + E; Movicol) as oral monotherapy in the treatment of faecal impaction in children, and to compare PEG + E with lactulose as maintenance therapy in a randomised trial. An initial open-label study of PEG + E in the inpatient treatment of faecal impaction (phase 1), followed by a randomised, double-blind comparison between PEG + E and lactulose for maintenance treatment of constipation over a 3-month period (phase 2) in children aged 2 to 11 years with a clinical diagnosis of faecal impaction. Disimpaction on PEG + E was achieved in 58 (92%) of 63 of children (89% of 2-4 year olds and 94% of 5-11 year olds) without additional interventions. A maximum dose of 4 sachets (for 2-4 year olds) or 6 sachets (for 5-11 year olds) was required; median time to disimpaction was 6 days (range, 3-7 days). Seven children (23%) reimpacted whilst taking lactulose, whereas no children reimpacted while taking PEG + E (P = 0.011). The total incidence rate of adverse events seen was higher in the lactulose group (83%) than in the PEG + E group (64%). PEG + E is safe and highly effective in the management of childhood constipation. It allows a single orally administered laxative to be used for disimpaction without recourse to invasive interventions. It is significantly more effective than lactulose as maintenance therapy, both in efficacy in treating constipation and efficacy in preventing the recurrence of faecal impaction.",A good-quality randomized controlled trials showed that polyethylene glycol + E effectively relieved fecal impaction (92% of 63 children) and was superior to lactulose for maintenance treatment. The rate of adverse effects (abdominal pain) was 64% with polyethylene glycol + E and 83% with lactulose.
"What is the best way to screen for breast cancer in women with implants
Augmentation mammaplasty has become more popular in Taiwan. Therefore, clinical imaging is necessary to evaluate those patients who develop breast cancers. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the detection of breast diseases after augmentation mammaplasty by means of mammography and sonography. A retrospective follow-up study and analysis of diagnostic methods including mammography, sonography, physical examination, and aspiration cytology was conducted on 105 patients who underwent augmentation mammaplasty at Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital between 1989 and 2001. A total of 105 patients were identified in this study, and mean follow-up was 4 years. Two tumors from 8 cancer patients were visible on standard mammograms, and seven tumors were diagnosed as cancer by sonography. One of 15 benign breast tumors was interpreted as a suspected cancer, and 7 tumors were interpreted as normal findings on mammograms. Fourteen of 15 benign breast tumors were diagnosed correctly except for one suspicious case examined by sonography. Sonography showed the highest rate of diagnostic accuracy (91.3%) and mammograms had the lowest rate (73.9%). The accuracy rate of physical examination was 73.9%, and aspiration cytology was 90.0% accurate. This study affirms that sonography is a more useful diagnostic tool than mammography in Taiwanese women who have undergone augmentation mammaplasty.","Although studies comparing screening methods have not been performed in the United States, a small Taiwanese study directly compared ultrasound to mammography in 105 women without breast implants. This retrospective cohort study found sonography to be a more useful diagnostic tool than mammography in Taiwanese women. Sonography had the highest sensitivity (87.5%) compared to physical examination (50.0%) and mammography (25.5%). Sonography was recommended as the imaging tool for Asian women with smaller, denser breasts. However, it is unclear whether this result applies to US women or women who have undergone breast augmentation surgery."
"Do acetaminophen and an nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs combined relieve osteoarthritis pain better than either alone
Osteoarthritis (OA) is often treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), acetaminophen, or specific inhibitors of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2). To assess the relative therapeutic efficacy of rofecoxib, celecoxib, and acetaminophen in adults with OA. Randomized, parallel-group, double-blind trial, conducted from June 1999 to February 2000, in 29 clinical centers in the United States. Three hundred eighty-two patients aged at least 40 years who had OA of the knee that was previously treated with NSAIDs or acetaminophen. Patients were randomly assigned to receive rofecoxib, 12.5 mg/d (n = 96); rofecoxib, 25 mg/d (n = 95); celecoxib, 200 mg/d (n = 97); or acetaminophen, 4000 mg/d (n = 94) for 6 weeks. Assessments over days 1 to 6 and over 6 weeks included pain on walking, night pain, pain at rest, and morning stiffness as measured on a Western Ontario McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (100-mm visual analog scale [VAS]) and global response to therapy compared among 4 treatment groups. 79% of patients completed the study. More patients treated with acetaminophen discontinued early due to lack of efficacy than patients treated with COX-2 inhibitors (31% vs 18%-19%). Efficacy assessed in the first 6 days of therapy showed greatest response to rofecoxib, 25 mg/d, followed by rofecoxib, 12.5 mg/d, celecoxib, and acetaminophen, respectively, in terms of relief of pain on walking (-32.2, - 29.0, - 26.4, and -20.6 mm change on the VAS; P</=.04 for all others vs acetaminophen; P =.05 for 25-mg rofecoxib vs celecoxib), rest pain (-21.8, - 18.6, - 15.5, and - 12.5 mm; P</=.02 for either dose of rofecoxib vs acetaminophen and P =.02 for rofecoxib, 25 mg/d, vs celecoxib), night pain (-25.2, - 22.0, - 18.7, and - 18.8 mm; P =.04 for rofecoxib, 25 mg/d, vs both acetaminophen and celecoxib), and morning stiffness (-30.4, - 28.4, - 25.7, and - 20.9 mm; P</=.02 for either dose of rofecoxib vs acetaminophen). Over 6 weeks, rofecoxib, 25 mg/d, provided greatest response for night pain (P<.002 vs celecoxib and P =.006 vs acetaminophen and P =.02 vs rofecoxib, 12.5 mg/d), composite pain subscale (P</=.03 vs all other treatments), stiffness subscale (P</=.04 vs celecoxib and acetaminophen), and physical function subscale (P =.001 vs acetaminophen). Global responses over 6 weeks showed a similar pattern (good or excellent response at week 6: 60%, 56%, 46%, and 39%, respectively; P</=.03 for rofecoxib, 25 mg/d, vs celecoxib and acetaminophen; P =.02 for rofecoxib, 12.5 mg/d, vs acetaminophen). All treatments were generally safe and well tolerated. Rofecoxib, 25 mg/d, provided efficacy advantages over acetaminophen, 4000 mg/d, celecoxib, 200 mg/d, and rofecoxib, 12.5 mg, for symptomatic knee OA.","One industry-sponsored randomized trial found rofecoxib superior to celecoxib, and both superior to acetaminophen in treatment of osteoarthritis pain. There was no difference in the incidence of side effects among the 3 medications. Thirty percent of patients taking 4 g/d acetaminophen discontinued the study because of lack of efficacy, compared with 20% of those taking either celecoxib or rofecoxib."
"What's the best treatment for gestational diabetes
We conducted a randomized clinical trial to determine whether treatment of women with gestational diabetes mellitus reduced the risk of perinatal complications. We randomly assigned women between 24 and 34 weeks' gestation who had gestational diabetes to receive dietary advice, blood glucose monitoring, and insulin therapy as needed (the intervention group) or routine care. Primary outcomes included serious perinatal complications (defined as death, shoulder dystocia, bone fracture, and nerve palsy), admission to the neonatal nursery, jaundice requiring phototherapy, induction of labor, cesarean birth, and maternal anxiety, depression, and health status. The rate of serious perinatal complications was significantly lower among the infants of the 490 women in the intervention group than among the infants of the 510 women in the routine-care group (1 percent vs. 4 percent; relative risk adjusted for maternal age, race or ethnic group, and parity, 0.33; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.14 to 0.75; P=0.01). However, more infants of women in the intervention group were admitted to the neonatal nursery (71 percent vs. 61 percent; adjusted relative risk, 1.13; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.03 to 1.23; P=0.01). Women in the intervention group had a higher rate of induction of labor than the women in the routine-care group (39 percent vs. 29 percent; adjusted relative risk, 1.36; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.15 to 1.62; P<0.001), although the rates of cesarean delivery were similar (31 percent and 32 percent, respectively; adjusted relative risk, 0.97; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.81 to 1.16; P=0.73). At three months post partum, data on the women's mood and quality of life, available for 573 women, revealed lower rates of depression and higher scores, consistent with improved health status, in the intervention group. Treatment of gestational diabetes reduces serious perinatal morbidity and may also improve the woman's health-related quality of life.","One study found a higher rate of neonatal intensive care unit admission in the treatment group, but the authors attributed this to physician awareness of the patient having gestational diabetes."

The natural history of untreated Osgood-Schlatter disease is presented in the retrospective study of 69 knees in 50 patients. Seventy-six percent of the patients believed they had no limitation of activity, although 60% still could not kneel without discomfort. Two groups of patients were identified: those who presented with radiologic fragmentation and had either separated ossicles or an abnormally ossified tuberosity at review, and those who presented with soft tissue swelling without radiologic fragmentation and were asymptomatic at review. There was a low incidence of patellar instability or anterior knee pain, and no case of premature proximal tibial epiphyseal arrest.","A retrospective review analyzed 50 patients with Osgood-Schlatter (69 knees) for an average of 9 years. No treatments or activity restrictions were recommended. At time of follow-up, 36 (76%) had no limitations, but kneeling continued to be uncomfortable in 60%."
"How should you manage a depressed patient unresponsive to an SSRI
The addition of lithium to the treatment regimens of previously nonresponding depressed patients has been repeatedly investigated in controlled studies. The authors undertook this meta-analysis to investigate the efficacy of lithium augmentation of conventional antidepressants. An attempt was made to identify all placebo-controlled trials of lithium augmentation in refractory depression. Only double-blind studies that involved participants who had been treated with lithium or placebo addition after not responding to conventional antidepressants were to be included in the meta-analysis. Further inclusion criteria were the use of accepted diagnostic criteria for depression and the use of response criteria based on the acceptable measurement of depression as an outcome variable. Studies were located by a search of the MEDLINE database, a search in the Cochrane Library, and an intensive search by hand of reviews on lithium augmentation. Nine of 11 placebo-controlled, double-blind studies were included in this meta-analysis. Aggregating three studies with a total of 110 patients that used a minimum lithium dose of 800 mg/day, or a dose sufficient to reach lithium serum levels of > or = 0.5 mEq/L, and a minimum treatment duration of 2 weeks, the authors found that the pooled odds ratio of response during lithium augmentation compared with the response during placebo treatment was 3.31 (95% confidence interval, 1.46-7.53). The corresponding relative response rate was 2.14 (95% confidence interval, 1.23-3.70), the absolute improvement in response rate was 27% (95% confidence interval, 9.8%-44.2%), and the number of patients needed to be treated to obtain one more responder was 3.7. Inclusion of six more studies that fulfilled inclusion criteria but which treated subjects with additional lithium for less than 2 weeks or with a lower lithium dose (total, 234 patients) resulted in even higher estimates. Lithium augmentation seems to be the treatment strategy in refractory depression that has been investigated most frequently in placebo-controlled, double-blind studies. The authors conclude from this meta-analysis that with respect to efficacy, lithium augmentation is the first-choice treatment procedure for depressed patients who fail to respond to antidepressant monotherapy.",Evidence from a meta-analysis with aggregate data from 3 studies representing a total of 110 patients showed that augmentation of various antidepressants with lithium leads to improved outcomes (number needed to treat [NNT]=3.7).
"What best prevents exerciseinduced bronchoconstriction for a child with asthma
Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) following strenuous physical exertion afflicts many people. It can be the cause of sub-optimal performance, symptoms such as cough, dyspnea, wheeze and chest tightness, and can lead people to avoid physical activity. Management of EIB focuses on prevention through pharmaco-therapy and alternate strategies. Single use, pre-exercise, beta-agonists and non-steroidal antiinflammatory agents are recommended. Bronchodilator medications have been commonly used to prevent narrowing of airways after exercise, but anti-inflammatory drugs such as nedocromil sodium have also been used. The objective of this review was to assess the effects of a single dose of nedocromil sodium to prevent exercise-induced bronchoconstriction. We searched the Cochrane Airways Group trials register, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, Current Contents, review articles, textbooks and reference lists of articles. We also contacted the drug manufacturer and primary authors for additional citations. Randomised trials comparing a single dose of nedocromil sodium with placebo to prevent exercise-induced bronchoconstriction in patients with EIB over six years of age. Trial quality assessment and data extraction were conducted independently by two reviewers. Study authors were contacted for confirmation of data. The combined results from 20 randomised controlled trials involving 280 participants, show that 4 mg, of nedocromil sodium inhaled 15 to 60 minutes prior to exercise significantly reduce the severity and duration of EIB in both adults and children, when compared to placebo. The maximum percentage fall in FEV1 was improved significantly compared to placebo (weighted mean difference 15.5 %; 95% confidence interval:13.2 to 18.1). For the maximum percentage fall in peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) the improvement was similar: WMD 15.0%, (95% CI 8.3 to 21.6). Nedocromil shortened the time to recover lung normal function from more than 30 minutes with placebo to less than 10 minutes with the drug. It had a greater effect on those patients with more severe exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (defined as an exercise-induced fall in lung function > 30% from baseline). There were no significant adverse effects reported with the short term use of nedocromil. A further search conducted in September 2001 did not yield any further studies. Nedocromil sodium used before exercise reduces the severity and duration of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction. This effect appears to be more pronounced in people with severe exercise-induced bronchoconstriction.",A systematic review of 20 RCTs (15 studying children and 5 studying adults) with patients aged >6 years showed that 4 mg of nedocromil (Tilade) inhaled 15 to 60 minutes before exercise significantly reduced the severity and duration of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction compared with placebo. It had a greater effect on patients with severe exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (defined as an exercise-induced fall in lung function >30% from baseline).
"What is the best treatment for analgesic rebound headaches
To assess the effects of amitriptyline and sudden analgesic withdrawal on headache frequency and quality of life in patients suffering from chronic daily headache related to analgesics abuse. Seventeen nondepressed patients with chronic drug-induced headache were included in a 9-week, parallel-group, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. After abrupt analgesic withdrawal, amitriptyline or an active placebo (trihexyphenidyl) was started. The primary efficacy variable was headache frequency recorded on a headache diary in the last 4 weeks of each treatment. The secondary efficacy variable was quality of life (Nottingham Health Profile). Headache frequency decreased by 45% in the amitriptyline group and by 28% in the trihexyphenidyl group. Amitriptyline enhanced all the dimensions of quality of life and significantly improved emotional reaction and social isolation. This pilot study suggests a beneficial effect of amitriptyline on headache frequency and quality of life for patients with chronic drug-induced headache.","A 9-week double-blind, placebo-controlled trial randomized 20 nondepressed patients with analgesic overuse headache to receive amitriptyline or active placebo (trihexyphenidyl). Patients were admitted to the hospital for 1 week and withdrawn from all analgesics. The 2 groups had similar baseline characteristics. During the hospitalization, the amitriptyline treatment group received intravenous amitriptyline escalating from 25 to 75 mg. During the following month, oral study medications were continued, and patients took low doses of aspirin or acetaminophen, as needed. There was no significant difference between the 2 groups with regard to analgesic use. At completion of this low-powered study, no difference was found between the 2 groups in headache frequency or analgesic use, although certain components of a quality-of-life scale were better in the amitriptyline group."
"What is the best treatment for hypertension in African Americans
Antihypertensive therapy is well established to reduce hypertension-related morbidity and mortality, but the optimal first-step therapy is unknown. To determine whether treatment with a calcium channel blocker or an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor lowers the incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD) or other cardiovascular disease (CVD) events vs treatment with a diuretic. The Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT), a randomized, double-blind, active-controlled clinical trial conducted from February 1994 through March 2002. A total of 33 357 participants aged 55 years or older with hypertension and at least 1 other CHD risk factor from 623 North American centers. Participants were randomly assigned to receive chlorthalidone, 12.5 to 25 mg/d (n = 15 255); amlodipine, 2.5 to 10 mg/d (n = 9048); or lisinopril, 10 to 40 mg/d (n = 9054) for planned follow-up of approximately 4 to 8 years. The primary outcome was combined fatal CHD or nonfatal myocardial infarction, analyzed by intent-to-treat. Secondary outcomes were all-cause mortality, stroke, combined CHD (primary outcome, coronary revascularization, or angina with hospitalization), and combined CVD (combined CHD, stroke, treated angina without hospitalization, heart failure [HF], and peripheral arterial disease). Mean follow-up was 4.9 years. The primary outcome occurred in 2956 participants, with no difference between treatments. Compared with chlorthalidone (6-year rate, 11.5%), the relative risks (RRs) were 0.98 (95% CI, 0.90-1.07) for amlodipine (6-year rate, 11.3%) and 0.99 (95% CI, 0.91-1.08) for lisinopril (6-year rate, 11.4%). Likewise, all-cause mortality did not differ between groups. Five-year systolic blood pressures were significantly higher in the amlodipine (0.8 mm Hg, P =.03) and lisinopril (2 mm Hg, P<.001) groups compared with chlorthalidone, and 5-year diastolic blood pressure was significantly lower with amlodipine (0.8 mm Hg, P<.001). For amlodipine vs chlorthalidone, secondary outcomes were similar except for a higher 6-year rate of HF with amlodipine (10.2% vs 7.7%; RR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.25-1.52). For lisinopril vs chlorthalidone, lisinopril had higher 6-year rates of combined CVD (33.3% vs 30.9%; RR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.05-1.16); stroke (6.3% vs 5.6%; RR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.02-1.30); and HF (8.7% vs 7.7%; RR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.07-1.31). Thiazide-type diuretics are superior in preventing 1 or more major forms of CVD and are less expensive. They should be preferred for first-step antihypertensive therapy.","The ALLHAT trial, a double-blind randomized controlled trials of 42,448 high-risk hypertensive patients aged >55 years, compared chlorthalidone (a thiazide-type diuretic) with amlodipine (Norvasc), lisinopril (Prinivil, Zestril), or doxazosin (Cardura). In this study, which included 36% African Americans, chlorthalidone, lisinopril, and amlodipine did not differ in preventing major cardiovascular events. However, lisinopril was associated with an increased risk for heart failure (relative risk [RR] for African Americans=1.32; 95% CI, 1.11-1.58) and stroke (RR for African Americans=1.4; 95% CI, 1.17-1.68), and amlodipine was associated with a higher risk of heart failure (RR in African Americans=1.47; 95% CI, 1.24-1.74). Additionally, angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor-induced angioedema or cough occurred more frequently among African American patients than white patients."
"Can transvaginal ultrasound detect endometrial disease among asymptomatic postmenopausal patients
Transvaginal ultrasonography is a noninvasive procedure that may be used to detect endometrial disease. However, its usefulness in screening for asymptomatic disease in postmenopausal women before or during treatment with estrogen or estrogen-progesterone replacement is not known. We compared the sensitivity and specificity of transvaginal ultrasonography and endometrial biopsy for the detection of endometrial disease in 448 postmenopausal women who received estrogen alone, cyclic or continuous estrogen-progesterone, or placebo for three years. Concurrent ultrasonographic and biopsy results were available for 577 examinations in the 448 women, 99 percent of whom were undergoing routine annual follow-up. Endometrial thickness was less than 5 mm in 45 percent of the examinations, 5 to 10 mm in 41 percent, more than 10 mm in 12 percent, and not measured in 2 percent, and it was higher in the women receiving estrogen alone than in the other groups. Biopsy detected 11 cases of serious disease: 1 case of adenocarcinoma, 2 cases of atypical simple hyperplasia, and 8 cases of complex hyperplasia. Biopsy also detected simple hyperplasia in 20 cases. At a threshold value of 5 mm for endometrial thickness, transvaginal ultrasonography had a positive predictive value of 9 percent for detecting any abnormality, with 90 percent sensitivity, 48 percent specificity, and a negative predictive value of 99 percent. With this threshold, a biopsy would be indicated in more than half the women, only 4 percent of whom had serious disease. Transvaginal ultrasonography has a poor positive predictive value but a high negative predictive value for detecting serious endometrial disease in asymptomatic postmenopausal women.","In a trial of postmenopausal estrogen use, 448 asymptomatic postmenopausal women were monitored with both endometrial biopsy and transvaginal ultrasound. Biopsy detected 11 cases of serious disease. At a threshold of 5 mm for endometrial thickness, ultrasound had a positive predictive value of 9% for detecting any abnormality with 90% sensitivity and 48% specificity. At this threshold, more than half of women evaluated with ultrasound would require endometrial biopsy as well, and only 4% of these patients would have serious disease. This study concludes that transvaginal ultrasound has a poor positive predictive value but a high negative predictive value for detecting serious endometrial disease for this asymptomatic population."
"What is the appropriate diagnostic evaluation of fibroids
The purpose of this study was to evaluate and compare the accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging and transvaginal ultrasonography in myoma diagnosis, mapping, and measurement. This was a double-blind study of 106 consecutive premenopausal women who underwent hysterectomy for benign reasons. Myomas (total, 257) were exactly mapped by magnetic resonance imaging and transvaginal ultrasonography; in each patient, we counted correctly identified myomas with pathologic position as true value. The presence of myomas was detected with the same high level of precision by both methods (magnetic resonance imaging: sensitivity, 0.99; specificity, 0.86; transvaginal ultrasonography: sensitivity, 0.99; specificity, 0.91). The mean number of correctly identified myomas was significantly higher by magnetic resonance imaging than by transvaginal ultrasonography (mean difference, 0.51 +/- 1.03; P <.001), a difference that narrowed to 0.08 +/- 0.76 (P =.60) in 26 patients with 1 to 4 myomas and uterine volumes <375 mL. Magnetic resonance imaging and transvaginal ultrasonography myoma diameter measurements had equal and high accuracies in patients with 1 to 4 myomas. Transvaginal ultrasonography is as efficient as magnetic resonance imaging in detecting myoma presence, but its capacity for exact myoma mapping falls short of that of magnetic resonance imaging, especially in large (>375 mL) multiple-myoma (>4) uteri.","In a double-blinded comparative study of 106 consecutive premenopausal women undergoing hysterectomy for benign reasons, magnetic resonance imaging and transvaginal sonography detected myomas with equal precision (TABLE). magnetic resonance imaging is preferred in cases for which exact myoma mapping is necessary and those with multiple myomas or large uteri who are scheduled for advanced surgical procedures."
"What is the best way to distinguish type 1 and 2 diabetes
To determine the prevalence of autoantibodies to IA-2 (IA-2Ab) and glutamic acid decarboxylase (GADAb) in type 2 diabetes, their relationship to disease duration, and their importance in management decisions. We undertook a study of 101 patients with type 2 diabetes (defined as nonketotic hyperglycemia at diagnosis) of varied duration (median, 4 years). Results were compared with those from 36 patients with type 1 diabetes also of varied duration (median, 2 years). IA-2Ab and GADAb were measured by radioligand-binding assays with use of in vitro-synthesized, 35S-labeled antigens. Of the 101 patients with type 2 diabetes, 20 (20%) were positive for GADAb; only 4 of these 20 were positive for IA-2Ab. In comparison, 75% of patients with type 1 diabetes were positive for GADAb, IA-2Ab, or both (P<0.0001). The coincidence of IA-2Ab positivity in GADAb-positive patients with type 2 diabetes was significantly lower than in patients with type 1 diabetes (20% versus 73%, respectively; P = 0.002). All four IA-2Ab- and GADAb-positive patients with type 2 diabetes required insulin and were younger than those positive for GADAb alone (P = 0.018). GADAb positivity in patients with type 2 diabetes was highly associated with insulin requirement (P = 0.004), with an odds ratio of 5.8 in predicting insulin dependence. Among patients with type 2 diabetes receiving insulin therapy, disease duration was significantly shorter (P = 0.025) and body mass index was significantly lower (P<0.001) in GADAb-positive versus GADAb-negative patients. In contrast to type 1 diabetes, in which GADAb values were negatively correlated with disease duration (r = -0.34; P = 0.044), no significant correlation with disease duration was observed in type 2 diabetes (r = -0.166; P = 0.48). Irrespective of duration of disease, measurement of IA-2Ab and GADAb can help to identify those patients with type 2 diabetes most likely to require insulin therapy.","Autoantibodies do predict an earlier need for insulin. One prevalence study of 101 type 2 adult patients found 20% were positive for glutamic acid decarboxylase autoantibody (GADAb), which was positively associated with insulin dependence at 4 years postdiagnosis (OR=5.8; 95% CI, 1.8-18.9). Eighty percent of patients with autoantibodies required insulin compared with 41% of patients without autoantibodies."
"What is the best workup for hypocalcemia
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a serious condition associated with premature mortality, decreased quality of life, and increased health-care expenditures. Untreated CKD can result in end-stage renal disease and necessitate dialysis or kidney transplantation. Risk factors for CKD include cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension, and obesity. To estimate the prevalence of CKD in the United States (overall and by health risk factors and other characteristics), CDC analyzed the most recent data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). This report summarizes the results of that analysis, which determined that 16.8% of the U.S. population aged >/=20 years had CKD, according to 1999-2004 NHANES data, compared with 14.5% from the 1988-1994 NHANES (i.e., NHANES III), an increase of 15.9% based on crude estimates of prevalence. Persons with diabetes or cardiovascular disease had a greater prevalence of CKD than persons without those conditions. The results underscore the need to continue surveillance for CKD and its risk factors in the United States and to implement new strategies to reduce the number of persons with this condition.","It is not surprising that renal failure is a common cause of hypocalcemia, given the high prevalence of chronic kidney disease in adults-11.2% of the total United States population older than 20 years has at least a mildly reduced glomerular filtration rate (stage 2, chronic kidney disease, with glomerular filtration rate <90 cc/min)."
"Does tamoxifen prevent breast cancer
In 1982, the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project initiated a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial (B-14) to determine the effectiveness of adjuvant tamoxifen therapy in patients with primary operable breast cancer who had estrogen receptor-positive tumors and no axillary lymph node involvement. The findings indicated that tamoxifen therapy provided substantial benefit to patients with early stage disease. However, questions arose about how long the observed benefit would persist, about the duration of therapy necessary to maintain maximum benefit, and about the nature and severity of adverse effects from prolonged treatment. We evaluated the outcome of patients in the B-14 trial through 10 years of follow-up. In addition, the effects of 5 years versus more than 5 years of tamoxifen therapy were compared. In the trial, patients were initially assigned to receive either tamoxifen at 20 mg/day (n = 1404) or placebo (n = 1414). Tamoxifen-treated patients who remained disease free after 5 years of therapy were then reassigned to receive either another 5 years of tamoxifen (n = 322) or 5 years of placebo (n = 321). After the study began, another group of patients who met the same protocol eligibility requirements as the randomly assigned patients were registered to receive tamoxifen (n = 1211). Registered patients who were disease free after 5 years of treatment were also randomly assigned to another 5 years of tamoxifen (n = 261) or to 5 years of placebo (n = 249). To compare 5 years with more than 5 years of tamoxifen therapy, data relating to all patients reassigned to an additional 5 years of the drug were combined. Patients who were not reassigned to either tamoxifen or placebo continued to be followed in the study. Survival, disease-free survival, and distant disease-free survival (relating to failure at distant sites) were estimated by use of the Kaplan-Meier method; differences between the treatment groups were assessed by use of the logrank test. The relative risks of failure (with 95% confidence intervals [CIs]) were determined by use of the Cox proportional hazards model. Reported P values are two-sided. Through 10 years of follow-up, a significant advantage in disease-free survival (69% versus 57%, P < .0001; relative risk = 0.66; 95% CI = 0.58-0.74), distant disease-free survival (76% versus 67%, P < .0001; relative risk = 0.70; 95% CI = 0.61-0.81), and survival (80% versus 76%, P = .02; relative risk = 0.84; 95% CI = 0.71-0.99) was found for patients in the group first assigned to receive tamoxifen. The survival benefit extended to those 49 years of age or younger and to those 50 years of age or older. Tamoxifen therapy was associated with a 37% reduction in the incidence of contralateral (opposite) breast cancer (P = .007). Through 4 years after the reassignment of tamoxifen-treated patients to either continued-therapy or placebo groups, advantages in disease-free survival (92% versus 86%, P = .003) and distant disease-free survival (96% versus 90%, P = .01) were found for those who discontinued tamoxifen treatment. Survival was 96% for those who discontinued tamoxifen compared with 94% for those who continued tamoxifen treatment (P = .08). A higher incidence of thromboembolic events was seen in tamoxifen-treated patients (through 5 years, 1.7% versus 0.4%). Except for endometrial cancer, the incidence of second cancers was not increased with tamoxifen therapy. The benefit from 5 years of tamoxifen therapy persists through 10 years of follow-up. No additional advantage is obtained from continuing tamoxifen therapy for more than 5 years.","An randomized controlled trials reported that women given tamoxifen for only 5 years for ER-positive breast cancer with negative nodes had improved disease-free survival compared with women randomized to continue tamoxifen more than 5 years (92% vs 86% respectively, P=.003)."
"What is the best way to distinguish type 1 and 2 diabetes
Slowly progressive insulin-dependent (type 1) diabetes mellitus (SPIDDM) is characterized by (1) late age of onset, with initial features of NIDDM and subsequent progression to insulin-dependent stage; (2) high predictive value of autoantibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase (GADAb) and islet cell antibodies (ICA) for progression of beta cell failure; (3) less predominant T cell response, which may attack and eventually destroy beta-cells in affected pancreas. These findings may suggest a rationale for intervention to prevent slowly progressive beta cell dysfunction in this type of diabetes. We identified three independent risk factors for progression of beta cell failure in SPIDDM: (1) sulfonylurea treatment; (2) ICA-positive periods; and (3) initial body weight. We hypothesized that removal of the risk factors for further progression of beta cell dysfunction will have beneficial effects on intervention strategy in treating SPIDDM. In our pilot study, we used a small dose of insulin instead of sulfonylurea in the early stage of treatment of patients with SPIDDM. Insulin-treated SPIDDM patients had a sustained C peptide response (CPR), while most of sulfonylurea-treated patients progressed to an insulin-dependent state. We organized a randomized multicenter clinical trial to study early treatment to prevent the progression of beta cell dysfunction in SPIDDM (the Tokyo Study). It was demonstrated that early intervention with insulin therapy is an effective treatment modality in the early stage of SPIDDM patients who had preserved beta cell function at entry (integrated value of serum C peptide values at 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes; Sigma CPR >or= 10 ng/mL) and high GADAb (>10 U/mL). Preventive insulin treatment was ineffective in the patients who had diminished insulin reserve at entry (Sigma CPR < 10 ng/mL). Insulin intervention to preserve beta cell dysfunction in SPIDDM is effective and safe in patients with preserved beta cell function and high GADAb titers at the initiation of insulin.","One study proposed treating those with autoantibody-positive diabetes (presumed type 1 or type 1.5) with insulin immediately, while initiating oral medications in those who test negative (presumed type 2 diabetes). This approach lacks significant patient-oriented outcome data, but his small randomized controlled trials of 55 patients was encouraging. With a 3-year follow-up rate of 89%, early insulin use in GADAb+ patients preserved C-peptide levels and possibly prolonged pancreatic beta cell survival. Insulin dependency, defined as needing insulin for survival, occurred in 47% of controls (who received oral sulfonylureas) and only 13% of patients receiving insulin (number needed to treat [NNT]= 4; P=.043). The theoretical benefit is that if beta cell exhaustion can be delayed, endogenous insulin production could be maintained to assist prevention of damaging postprandial glucose spikes."
"Do inhaled steroids increase the risk of osteoporosis
The impact of long-term inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) therapy on bone mineral density (BMD) is poorly understood. To evaluate the impact of long-term ICS use on BMD. Random-effects meta-analysis. Published and unpublished literature were identified by searches of MEDLINE and EMBASE databases and consultation with experts. Studies reporting BMD among adult asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients using ICS and non-ICS controls were identified. Studies selected for review included at least 1 year of follow-up. Two independent reviewers evaluated studies; data from those meeting specified inclusion criteria were abstracted for inclusion in the meta-analysis. Fourteen (5.3%) of 266 reviewed studies met specified inclusion criteria. Sufficient data were available to perform meta-analysis on 3 measures for ICS-using patients (lumbar, femoral neck, and major trochanter BMD) and 1 measure (lumbar BMD) for non-ICS-using controls. Using current National Asthma Education and Prevention Program definitions, the majority of studies (12 of 14) included patients receiving moderate to high doses of ICSs. Among ICS users, annual changes from baseline in lumbar, femoral neck, and major trochanter BMD (-0.23%, -0.17%, and +1.46%, respectively) were not statistically significant. Mean changes in lumbar BMD were also not significantly different from controls (-0.02%). Further, annual changes in lumbar BMD were not statistically significant for subgroups of patients with asthma or COPD. Long-term use of ICSs in patients with asthma or COPD was not associated with significant changes in BMD.","A fair-quality 2004 meta-analysis of 14 randomized trials (2300 participants) included 2 studies (448 subjects) that overlapped with the Cochrane review. There were no significant changes in bone mineral density with moderately high doses of inhaled corticosteroids at 1 to 3 years follow-up. Annual changes in lumbar and femoral neck bone mineral density (-0.23% and -0.17%, respectively) were not statistically significant. Mean changes in lumbar bone mineral density were not significantly different from controls (-0.02)."
"How useful are autoantibodies in diagnosing thyroid disorders
An original radioimmunoassay for quantitation of circulating autoantibodies (aAb) to thyroperoxidase (TPO) proved to be well suited for large scale routine testing. The present study was aimed to assess the prevalence of aAb to TPO in patients with various thyroid and autoimmune disease and, for comparison, in women referred for reproductive disorders and indication of in vitro fertilization. Anti-TPO aAb were measured in sera from 32 healthy subjects and 262 patients thoroughly investigated for thyroid dysfunction. As determined in healthy subjects, the normal level of aAb to TPO in serum ranged from 0.30 to 3.07 mg/l (of affinity-purified) anti-TPO aAb. Anti-TPO and anti-MIC aAb levels were both normal in 115 patients and correlated well (r = 0.835, P less than 0.001) in the remaining 147 patients. Coexistence of normal level of anti-TPO aAb and abnormal level of anti-MIC aAb was found in 4 patients and ascribed to a lack of specificity or sensitivity of the test for anti-MIC aAb. Coexistence of abnormal level of anti-TPO aAb and normal level of anti-MIC aAb was found in 67 patients of whom 62 presented only slightly elevated (3.1 to 10.0 mg/l) anti-TPO aAb concentration; the 5 remaining patients, all with overt thyroid autoimmune disease, showed anti-TPO levels between 10.7 to 100.7 mg/l.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","In a study comparing AMA to TPOAb, the thyroid antibody test results of 32 healthy patients were compared with those of 262 clinic patients.

"How long is expectant management safe in first-trimester miscarriage
Spontaneous abortion is a common problem in everyday clinical practice, accounting for 15 to 20 percent of all recognized pregnancies. The traditional treatment of this problem has been surgical, emptying the uterus by dilatation and curettage (D&C). Recent therapeutic and laboratory advances call surgical therapy into question for many patients. It is believed that this pooled quantitative literature evaluation is the first with the goal to clarify the roles of expectant, medical, and surgical treatment of this common problem. The literature review was focused on published studies in the English language of outcomes of therapy for spontaneous abortion in the first trimester. We looked for both observational and randomized controlled trials. A successful outcome of treatment required that three criteria be met: vaginal bleeding stopped by 3 weeks, products of conception fully expelled by 2 weeks, and absence of complications. Pooled weighted average success estimates and standard errors were determined for each study; 95 percent confidence intervals were calculated for each form of treatment. Sensitivity analysis compared randomized controlled trials with observational studies for both expectant and surgical treatment. Of the 31 studies retrieved, 18 met inclusion criteria, including 9 involving expectant treatment (545 pooled patients), 3 for medical treatment (prostaglandin or antiprogesterone agents) (198 pooled patients), and 10 for surgical treatment (D&C) (1408 pooled patients). Successful outcomes were found in 92.5 percent of patients receiving expectant treatment, in 93.6 percent of those undergoing D&C, and in 51.5 percent of patients receiving medical treatment. Expectant management of spontaneous abortion in the first trimester is safe and effective for many afebrile patients whose blood pressure and heart rate are stable and who have no excess bleeding or unacceptable pain. Transvaginal sonographic studies might be useful in patient selection, and serial chorionic gonadotropin monitoring should be considered while observing the initial course of expectant treatment. Currently there is insufficient evidence to support medical therapy of spontaneous abortion, and further research is needed to clarify the more limited role of surgical treatment.","A systematic review of 18 studies, including 3 RCTs, compared outcomes for expectant management (545 women) vs surgical evacuation (1408 women) for first-trimester spontaneous abortion. A successful first-trimester spontaneous abortion was defined as vaginal bleeding for 3 weeks or less, fully expelled products of conception by 14 days, and no complications (infection, transfusion, uterine perforation, hospitalization, or death). Expectant management was successful in 93% overall, and 80% using only the data from RCTs."
"What is the best therapy for constipation in infants
The Authors investigated the effects of Allomin with admixture of 2% and 4% lactulose on constipation in infants aged 0-6 months reared on breast-milk substitutes. The investigation was randomized and double-blind and was carried out during the period 1.4.1987-31.7.1988 on non-hospitalized infants in the counties of Funen and North Jutland in cooperation with the health visitors in these regions. Constipation was defined as hard and difficult defaecation and the trial period lasted for 14 days. Parents of the infants who participated classified the infants' motions according to consistence and degree of difficulty in defaecation on special forms. A total of 220 children participated and these received, after randomizing, either Allomin-lactulose 2% or 4% as the only breast-milk substitute during the period of observation. The effect of treatment was defined as ""no constipation"" i.e. all motions during 24 hours described as easy and of normal or thin consistence. In addition, the effect was measured by the parents' general impression of what the infant thrived best on. With both of the preparations, treatment was effective in over 90% of the infants in both the groups without significant difference. The effect occurred gradually and, in some cases, up to 8-10 days after initiation of treatment without significant difference in the rate of effect between the groups. After the effect had commenced, significantly fewer thin motions occurred in the 2% group than in the 4% group. 92% of the infants in the 2% group and 91% in the 4% group wanted to continue the Allomin-lactulose preparation rather than the usual breast-milk substitute. A retrospective questionnaire to parents of 97 infants who had continued with Allomin-lactulose 2% was answered by 84.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","One uncontrolled trial of 220 functionally constipated, bottle-fed infants younger than 6 months showed normalization of stools in 90% of infants within 2 weeks of treatment with 2% or 4% lactulose. No other evidence has been published about the benefits or harms of sorbitol-containing juices, fiber, osmotic laxatives, formula switching, rectal stimulation with rectal thermometers, or glycerin suppositories."
"Does regular exercise reduce the pain and stiffness of osteoarthritis
Therapeutic exercise is used as one modality to treat people with osteoarthritis (OA). To evaluate the effectiveness of therapeutic exercise of differing intensities on objective and subjective measures of disease activity in people with OA. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Pedro, Current Contents, Sports Discus and CINAHL up to and including December 2002. The Cochrane Field of Rehabilitation and Related Therapies and the Cochrane Musculoskeletal Review Group were also contacted for a search of their specialized registers. Handsearching was conducted on all retrieved articles for additional studies. Comparative controlled studies, such as randomized controlled trials, controlled clinical trials, cohort studies or case/control studies, of therapeutic exercises compared to control or active interventions in people with OA were eligible. No language restrictions were applied. Abstracts were also accepted. Two independent reviewers identified potential articles from the literature search. These reviewers extracted data using pre-defined extraction forms. Consensus was reached on all data extraction. The two reviewers used a five point scale to assess the quality of the selected articles. Randomization, double-blinding and description of withdrawals were assessed. One study involving 39 participants met the inclusion criteria. The review indicates that there were no significant differences between high intensity and low intensity aerobic exercise on participants with OA of the knee for functional status, gait, pain and aerobic capacity (Mangione 1999). Both high intensity and low intensity aerobic exercise appear to be equally effective in improving a patient's functional status, gait, pain and aerobic capacity for people with OA of the knee. Further research involving a greater number of subjects, and a larger number of studies involving a control group is needed to further substantiate these results.","In a Cochrane systematic review that evaluated the intensity of exercise, only 1 study with 39 participants met the inclusion criteria. This limited-power study found no difference between the effect of low-intensity and high-intensity exercise on pain reduction or function."
"Should liver enzymes be checked in a patient taking niacin
To evaluate the safety and efficacy of controlled-release niacin in patients with hyperlipoproteinemia. A retrospective cohort study. A Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center. A consecutive sample of 969 predominantly elderly male veterans treated for dyslipoproteinemia with controlled-release niacin between October 1988 and October 1991. Primary outcomes were lipid levels and lipoprotein cholesterol response, alternations in levels of hepatic enzymes and blood chemistry test results, and characterization of niacin-induced hepatotoxicity abstracted from the patient's medical, laboratory, and pharmacy records. 93% (896 of 969) of the cohort was evaluable. Patients (age, 61.7 years [9.4 years], mean [SD]) were treated for 1 to 36 months (13.0 months [9.7 months]) with an average maintenance dose of 1.67 g/d (0.8 g/d). Niacin was discontinued in 48.5% (435 of 896) of the patients primarily because of adverse effects. Poor glycemic control led to discontinuation in 40.6% (43 of 106) of the patients with diabetes mellitus. The lipoprotein response was dose-related and favorable (levels of total cholesterol, -19.1%; low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, -24.0%; high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, +5.7%; and triglycerides, -32.5%). Statistically but not clinically meaningful dose-related increases were seen in levels of liver enzymes and serum glucose (aspartate aminotransferase, +29%; alanine aminotransferase, +23%; alkaline phosphatase, +25%; and glucose, +7%; P = 0.0001). Twenty of 896 (2.2%) and 42 of 896 (4.7%) patients met biochemical criteria for probable and for possible or probable niacin-induced hepatotoxicity, respectively. Predisposing factors included high dose, alcohol use, preexisting liver disease, and concurrent oral sulfonylurea therapy. Controlled-release niacin is effective in treating dyslipoproteinemia in selected middle-aged and elderly veterans, but approximately one half of patients discontinued the drug because of adverse effects or other causes including noncompliance. Niacin should be avoided in patients with hepatic dysfunction or a history of liver disease, patients with diabetes mellitus, and patients who abuse alcohol. Because controlled-release niacin seems to be more potent than crystalline niacin, product substitution without dose adjustment should be avoided.","In a retrospective cohort of 969 veterans taking LA/SR niacin, those who developed hepatotoxicity had onset between 1 and 28 months of initiating treatment."
"Does tight control of blood glucose in pregnant women with diabetes improve neonatal outcomes
Our purpose was to examine the maternal and fetal outcomes of the 180 women with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus who became pregnant during the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial. The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial was a multicenter controlled clinical trial that compared intensive with conventional therapy in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Intensive therapy, with the aim of achieving normal glycemic control, was initiated in women originally assigned to conventional therapy who actively sought to become pregnant or who became pregnant. A total of 180 women completed 270 pregnancies between 1983 and 1993, with 191 total live births. The mean glycosylated hemoglobin level was significantly different between the treatment groups at conception (7.4% +/- 1.3% in intensive vs. 8.1% +/- 1.7% in conventional therapy, p = 0.0001) but was similar during gestation (6.6% +/- 0.8% and 6.6% +/- 1.3%). Nine congenital malformations were identified (4.7%), eight of which occurred in women originally assigned to conventional therapy (p = 0.06). There were 32 spontaneous abortions, 13.3% in the intensive and 10.4% in the women originally assigned to conventional treatment (not significant). There were no significant differences in outcome between the women with conventional treatment who initiated intensive therapy preconception and those who began it after conception. Timely institution of intensive therapy is associated with rates of spontaneous abortion and congenital malformation similar to those in the nondiabetic population.","A 10-year randomized controlled trials evaluated the outcomes of 270 pregnancies in women who had received either intensive (SQ infusion or multiple daily injections) or conventional insulin regimens prior to pregnancy. Women were advised to use intensive therapy when they were trying to conceive, and all were changed to intensive therapy if pregnancy was confirmed. Women in the intensive therapy group had normal HbA1c levels for an average of 40 months before conception. Women receiving intensive therapy had lower mean HbA1c levels at conception (7.4 ± 1.3 standard deviation vs 8.1 ± 1.7 SD) and fewer major congenital anomalies (0.7% vs 5.9%; number needed to treat=19) than did women in the conventional group. When infants with genetic malformations were excluded from the analysis, rates of congenital malformations were similar in women switched to intensive therapy either before or after conception (3.8% vs 3.6%). No differences were seen between neonatal mortality, spontaneous abortion rates, birth weights, Apgar scores, and hypocalcemia or hypoglycemia rates."
"Should we recommend universal neonatal hearing screening
The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of transient evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAEs), distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs), and auditory brain stem responses (ABRs) as tools for identification of neonatal hearing impairment. A total of 4911 infants including 4478 graduates of neonatal intensive care units, 353 well babies with one or more risk factors for hearing loss (Joint Committee on Infant Hearing, 1994) and 80 well babies without risk factor who did not pass one or more neonatal test were targeted as the potential subject pool on which test performance would be assessed. During the neonatal period, they were evaluated using TEOAEs in response to an 80 dB pSPL click, DPOAE responses to two stimulus conditions (L1 = L2 = 75 dB SPL and L1 = 65 dB SPL L2 = 50 dB SPL), and ABR elicited by a 30 dB nHL click. In an effort to describe test performance, these ""at-risk"" infants were asked to return for behavioral audiologic assessments, using visual reinforcement audiometry (VRA) at 8 to 12 mo corrected age, regardless of neonatal test results. Sixty-four percent of these subjects returned and reliable VRA data were obtained on 95.6% of these returnees. This approach is in contrast to previous studies in which, by necessity, efforts were made to follow only those infants who ""failed"" the neonatal screening tests. The accuracy of the neonatal measures in predicting hearing status at 8 to 12 mo corrected age was determined. Only those infants who provided reliable, monaural VRA test results were included in the analysis. Separate analyses were performed without regard to intercurrent events (i.e., events between the neonatal and VRA tests that could cause their results to disagree), and then after accounting for the possible influence of intercurrent events such as otitis media and late-onset or progressive hearing loss. Low refer rates were achieved for the stopping criteria used in the present study, especially when a protocol similar to the one recommended in the National Institutes of Health (1993) Consensus Conference Report was followed. These analyses, however, do not completely describe test performance because they did not compare neonatal screening test results with a gold standard test of hearing. Test performance, as measured by the area under a relative operating characteristic curve, were similar for all three neonatal tests when neonatal test results were compared with VRA data obtained at 8 to 12 mo corrected age. However, ABRs were more successful at determining auditory status at 1 kHz, compared with the otoacoustic emission (OAE) tests. Performance was more similar across all three tests when they were used to identify hearing loss at 2 and 4 kHz. No test performed perfectly. Using either the two- or three-frequency pure-tone average (PTA), with a fixed false alarm rate of 20%, hit rates for the neonatal tests, in general, exceeded 80% when hearing impairment was defined as behavioral thresholds > or =30 dB HL. All three tests performed similarly when a two-frequency (2 and 4 kHz) PTA was used as the gold standard; OAE test performance decreased when a three-frequency PTA (adding 1 kHz) was used as the gold standard definition. For both PTA and all three neonatal screening measures, however, hit rate increased as the magnitude of hearing loss increased. Singly, all three neonatal hearing screening tests resulted in low refer rates, especially if referrals for follow-up were made only for the cases in which stopping criteria were not met in both ears. Following a protocol similar to that recommended in the National Institutes of Health (1993) Consensus Conference report resulted in refer rates that were less than 4%. TEOAEs at 80 dB pSPL, DPOAE at L1 = 65, L2 = 50 dB SPL and ABR at 30 dB nHL measured during the neonatal period, and as implemented in the current study, performed similarly at predicting behavioral hearing status at 8 to 12","Individually, OAE and ABR accurately diagnose neonatal hearing loss. One multicenter cohort of 2995 infants measured test performance of OAE and ABR against the gold standard (visual reinforcement audiometry performed at 8-12 months). The authors used a receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve to plot speech awareness thresholds for both tests. When middle-ear pathology and progressive hearing loss were excluded, the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curves for ABR and OAE were 0.91 and 0.94, respectively, indication that both tests had excellent test accuracy (a perfect test would have an area under the curve of 1.0)."
"What vitamins and minerals should be given to breastfed and bottle-fed infants
To analyze the characteristics of infants and children diagnosed with nutritional rickets at two medical centers in North Carolina in the 1990s. The physical and radiographic findings, calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels of infants and children diagnosed with nutritional rickets at two medical centers were reviewed. Breast-feeding data were obtained from the North Carolina Women, Infants and Children Program (WIC). Thirty patients with nutritional rickets were first seen between 1990 and June of 1999. Over half of the cases occurred in 1998 and the first half of 1999. All patients were African American children who were breast fed without receiving supplemental vitamin D. The average duration of breast-feeding was 12.5 months. The age at diagnosis was 5 to 25 months, with a median age of 15.5 months. Growth failure was common: length was <5th percentile in 65% of cases, and weight was <5th percentile in 43%. Factors that may have contributed to the increase in referrals of children with nutritional rickets include more African American women breast-feeding, fewer infants receiving vitamin D supplements, and mothers and children exposed to less sunlight. We recommend that all dark-skinned breast-fed infants and children receive vitamin D supplementation.",A case review of nutritional rickets in North Carolina between 1990 and 1999 found that all 30 patients identified were breastfed African American infants.
"When should we treat isolated high triglycerides
Prior research suggests that adding triglyceride determinations to measurements of total cholesterol and cholesterol subfractions may improve the prediction of coronary heart disease (CHD). To determine the additional value of measuring triglyceride levels, in addition to cholesterol levels and subfractions, for predicting CHD. A set of secondary analyses of previously reported studies. We performed secondary analyses of data from the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial, the Lipid Research Clinics Coronary Primary Prevention Trial, and the Lipid Research Clinics Prevalence and Mortality Follow-Up Study. Predictor variables included the levels of fasting triglycerides, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and fasting blood glucose; age; blood pressure; cigarette smoking; body mass index; and postmenopausal estrogen use. Analytic methods included Cox proportional hazards models, calculation of stratified crude incidence rates, and measurement of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Outcome variables were fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarctions. With few exceptions, no significant interactions between cholesterol subfractions and triglyceride levels were found and receiver operating characteristic curve analyses revealed that triglyceride measurements did not improve discrimination between those subjects who did and did not suffer CHD events. In men, categorical analyses employing both triglyceride and cholesterol levels were similar to those using cholesterol categories alone. In the one study of women, those subjects with both a high-risk cholesterol profile and high triglyceride levels were more likely to have a CHD event, though this finding was based on fewer subjects and CHD events. These data suggest that, in men, measurement of serum triglyceride levels does not provide clinically meaningful information about CHD risk beyond that obtainable by measurement of serum cholesterol subfractions alone.","Another meta-analysis of 3 prospective intervention trials with 15,880 enrolled subjects found that triglyceride levels did not provide any clinically meaningful information about risk beyond that provided by other cholesterol subfractions."
"What is the best diagnostic approach to postmenopausal vaginal bleeding in women taking hormone replacement therapy
The purpose of this study was to use transvaginal ultrasonographic measurements to find the thickness of the endometrium below which the risk of endometrial abnormality in women with postmenopausal bleeding is low. This multicenter study was carried out at eight clinics in four Nordic countries. The study included 1168 women with postmenopausal bleeding scheduled for curettage Before the curettage was performed, the thickness of the endometrium was measured with transvaginal ultrasonography. The measurement included both endometrial layers (double-layer technique). The transvaginal ultrasonographic measurement was compared with the histopathologic diagnosis of the curettage specimens. In women with atrophic endometrium the mean endometrial thickness (+/- SD) was 3.9 +/- 2.5 mm. The corresponding figures for women with endometrial cancer were 21.1 +/- 11.8 mm. No malignant endometrium was thinner than 5 mm. In 30 women (2.8%) it was not possible to measure the thickness of the endometrium; one of these women had endometrial cancer. The 95% confidence limit for the probability of excluding endometrial abnormality was 5.5% when the endometrial thickness was < or = 4 mm as measured by transvaginal ultrasonography. The risk of finding pathologic endometrium at curettage when the endometrium is < or = 4 mm as measured by transvaginal ultrasonography is 5.5%. Thus in women with postmenopausal bleeding and an endometrium < or = 4 mm it would seem justified to refrain from curettage.","Any woman taking hormone replacement therapy who has irregular bleeding after a year should have a Pap test, since cervical abnormalities are not uncommon."
"Should you use steroids to treat infectious mononucleosis
Ninety-four patients with infectious mononucleosis and symptoms < or = 7 days were randomized to treatment with oral acyclovir (800 mg 5 times/day) and prednisolone (0.7 mg/kg for the first 4 days, which was reduced by 0.1 mg/kg on consecutive days for another 6 days; n = 48), or placebo (n = 46) for 10 days. Oropharyngeal Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) shedding was significantly inhibited during the treatment period (P = .02, Mann-Whitney rank test). No significant effect was observed for duration of general illness, sore throat, weight loss, or absence from school or work. The frequency of latent EBV-infected B lymphocytes in peripheral blood and the HLA-restricted EBV-specific cellular immunity, measured 6 months after onset of disease, was not affected by treatment. Thus, acyclovir combined with prednisolone inhibited oropharyngeal EBV replication without affecting duration of clinical symptoms or development of EBV-specific cellular immunity.","A trial of combined therapy with acyclovir and prednisolone in 94 patients found no differences in resolution of sore throat, weight loss, and absence from school or work in the treatment group."
"Does anticoagulation prevent thrombosis for persons with fractures distal to the hip
Deep-vein thrombosis is a well-recognized complication after trauma to the legs and subsequent immobilization, but there are no generally accepted approaches to preventing this complication. We performed a prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of subcutaneous reviparin (1750 anti-Xa units given once daily) in 440 patients who required immobilization in a plaster cast or brace for at least five weeks after a leg fracture or rupture of the Achilles tendon. The study drug was given throughout the period of immobilization. Venography of the injured leg was performed within one week after removal of the plaster cast or brace, or earlier if there were symptoms suggesting deep-vein thrombosis. Data on efficacy and end points were available for 371 patients. Deep-vein thrombosis was diagnosed in 17 of the 183 patients randomly assigned to receive reviparin (9 percent) and in 35 of the 188 patients randomly assigned to receive placebo (19 percent) (odds ratio, 0.45; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.24 to 0.82). Most of the thromboses were distal (14 in the reviparin group and 25 in the placebo group). There were two cases of pulmonary embolism, both in patients in the placebo group who also had proximal deep-vein thrombosis. There were no differences between the two groups with respect to bleeding or other adverse events. Deep-vein thrombosis is common in persons with leg injury requiring prolonged immobilization. Reviparin given once daily appears to be effective and safe in reducing the risk of this complication.","An randomized controlled trials evaluated reviparin (another European LMWH) vs placebo in 440 outpatients with lower limb injuries, of whom 293 had fractures. About half had surgical management and all were treated with a plaster cast or brace for an average of 44 days. Most were ambulatory with crutches. All underwent venography within a week of cast removal. The deep venous thrombosis rate for fracture patients using reviparin was 10.4%, vs 18.2% among those without low-molecular-weight heparin prophylaxis (absolute risk reduction=7.8%; NNT=12.8). Three fourths of the DVTs were in distal veins, and 21% of the DVTs in the low-molecular-weight heparin patients occurred in deep veins compared with 34% in patients without. Two pulmonary emboli occurred, both in patients without low-molecular-weight heparin prophylaxis."
"Is training patients in self-examination an effective way to screen for melanoma
Although some evidence indicates that early detection protects against the development of lethal melanoma, no randomized clinical trials have been conducted to measure the efficacy of early detection (or screening) in preventing death from this disease. Since melanoma incidence in the United States is relatively rare, a randomized clinical trial to test the efficacy of screening would be extremely expensive. As an alternative to a randomized clinical trial, we conducted a population-based, case-control study to investigate whether early detection through skin self-examination (SSE) is associated with a decreased risk of lethal melanoma (includes the presence of advanced disease with distant metastases in addition to death from melanoma). SSE (conducting a careful, deliberate, and purposeful examination of the skin) was assessed in all subjects by use of a structured questionnaire and personal interviews. The major exposure variable, SSE, was defined following focus-group interviews with melanoma patients and healthy control subjects. The final study population consisted of 1199 Caucasian residents of the state of Connecticut enrolled from January 15, 1987, through May 15, 1989; 650 individuals were newly diagnosed with cutaneous melanoma, and the remaining 549 individuals were age- and sex-frequency matched control subjects from the general population. During the study interviews, nevi on the arms and backs of subjects were counted. In 5 years of follow-up (through March 1994), 110 lethal cases of melanoma were identified. The study design allowed separate estimation of the impact of SSE on reduced melanoma incidence (primary prevention) and survival among incident cases (secondary prevention). Odds ratios (ORs) were used to measure the associations between SSE and melanoma and between SSE and lethal melanoma. SSE, practiced by only 15% of all subjects, was associated with a reduced risk of melanoma incidence (adjusted OR = 0.66; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.44-0.99; comparing case patients with control subjects). The data indicated further that SSE may reduce the risk of advanced disease among melanoma patients (unadjusted risk ratio = 0.58; 95% CI = 0.31-1.11); however, longer follow-up is required to confirm this latter estimate. If both estimates are correct, they suggest, in combination, that SSE may reduce mortality from melanoma by 63% (adjusted OR = 0.37; 95% CI = 0.16-0.84; comparing lethal cases with general population controls). SSE may provide a useful and inexpensive screening method to reduce the incidence of melanoma. SSE may also reduce the development of advanced disease. The results of this study need to be replicated before strategies to increase the practice of SSE are further developed and promoted.","A case-control study compared skin self-examination among 650 Caucasian patients newly diagnosed with melanoma and 549 age- and sex-matched controls. Fifteen percent of all patients practiced SSE. Investigators monitored a statewide registry system for 5.4 years to identify 110 participants with melanoma who had major adverse outcomes (distant metastases or death). Patients with a history of melanoma who practiced skin self-examination had lower mortality (odds ratio [OR]=0.42; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.21-0.85) than those who didn't. One potential weakness of the study was possible lead-time bias, which could overestimate the risk reduction from SSE. Another was the 5.4-year follow-up, because malignant melanoma can recur as long as 10 years later."
"What are effective treatments for oppositional defiant behaviors in adolescents
To examine (1) moderating effects of oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) on attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) treatment response and (2) responses of ODD symptoms to atomoxetine. Children and adolescents (ages 8-18) with ADHD were treated for approximately 8 weeks with placebo or atomoxetine (fixed dosing: 0.5, 1.2, or 1.8 mg/kg/day, b.i.d.) under randomized, double-blind conditions. Among patients with lifetime diagnostic information (n = 293), 39% were diagnosed with comorbid ODD and 61% were not. Treatment-group differences and differences between patients with and without comorbid ODD were examined post hoc for changes on the Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale IV-Parent version, investigator-administered and -scored; Conners' Parent Rating Scale-Revised Short Form; Clinical Global Impressions Severity of ADHD Scale; and the parent-rated Child Health Questionnaire. Youths with ADHD and comorbid ODD showed statistically significant improvement in ADHD, ODD, and quality-of-life measures. Treatment response was similar in youths with and without ODD, except that the comorbid group showed improvement compared with placebo at 1.8 mg/kg/day but not 1.2 mg/kg/day. In contrast, youths without ODD showed improvement at 1.2 mg/kg/day and no incremental benefit at 1.8 mg/kg/day. Atomoxetine treatment improves ADHD and ODD symptoms in youths with ADHD and ODD, although the comorbid group may require higher doses.","An randomized controlled trials of different doses of atomoxetine (Strattera) treatment vs placebo for children ages 8 to 18 (mean age=11) with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder alone (N=178) and children with both attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and oppositional defiant disorder (N=115) found significant effect sizes for atomoxetine in both groups. Two dosages of atomoxetine (1.2 and 1.8 mg/kg/d) produced equivalent effect sizes in the ADHD-only group (0.55 and 0.56); however, the higher dosage had a greater effect size (0.49 vs 0.69) in the group with oppositional defiant disorder comorbid with ADHD."
"Do statins cause myopathy
We conducted a population-based cohort study to estimate the risk of myopathy associated with use of lipid-lowering drugs. Using data from general practices in the United Kingdom in 1991 through 1997, we identified three cohorts of individuals 40 to 74 years of age. One cohort comprised 17,219 persons who had received at least one prescription for lipid-lowering drugs in the period; a second cohort consisted of patients with a hyperlipidemia diagnosis who had not been prescribed lipid-lowering drugs (N = 28,974); and a third cohort comprised 50,000 individuals from the general population with no diagnosis of hyperlipidemia. The incidence rate of myopathy in the cohort of users of lipid-lowering drugs was 2.3 per 10,000 person-years [95% confidence interval (95% CI) = 1.2-4.4], which exceeded the incidence rates observed in the nontreated hyperlipidemia cohort [0 per 10,000 person-years (95% CI = 0.0-0.4)] and the general population [0.2 per 10,000 person-years (95% CI = 0.1-0.4)]. The relative risks of myopathy in current users of fibrates and statins compared with nonusers were 42.4 (95% CI = 11.6-170.5) and 7.6 (95% CI = 1.4-41.3), respectively. Potential risk factors other than drug use could not explain our findings in the nested case-control analysis. We conclude that use of lipid-lowering drugs is associated with a substantially greater risk of myopathy, which is most pronounced for fibrates. The absolute risk of myopathy in users of lipid-lowering drugs is, however, small.","A large cohort study revealed a very small but statistically significant increased risk of myopathy in patients taking statins (number needed to harm=10,000/year). A large well-done British epidemiologic cohort study (n=96,193) found an increased rate of myopathy (broadly defined, not requiring creatine kinase elevation) among patients taking statins, with an absolute rate difference of 1 per 10,000 person-years."
"What is the value of screening for heart disease with an exercise stress test (EST) in an asymptomatic person
Empirical scores, computerized ST-segment measurements, and equations have been proposed as tools for improving the diagnostic performance of the exercise test. To compare the diagnostic utility of these scores, measurements, and equations with that of visual ST-segment measurements in patients with reduced workup bias. Prospective analysis. 12 university-affiliated Veterans Affairs Medical Centers. 814 consecutive patients who presented with angina pectoris and agreed to undergo both exercise testing and coronary angiography. Digital electrocardiographic recorders and angiographic calipers were used for testing at each site, and test results were sent to core laboratories. Although 25% of patients had previously had testing, workup bias was reduced, as shown by comparison with a pilot study group. This reduction resulted in a sensitivity of 45% and a specificity of 85% for visual analysis. Computerized measurements and visual analysis had similar diagnostic power. Equations incorporating nonelectrocardiographic variables and either visual or computerized ST-segment measurement had similar discrimination and were superior to single ST-segment measurements. These equations correctly classified 5 more patients of every 100 tested (areas under the receiver-operating characteristic curve, 0.80 for equations and 0.68 for visual analysis; P < 0.001) in this population with a 50% prevalence of disease. Standard exercise tests had lower sensitivity but higher specificity in this population with reduced work-up bias than in previous studies. Computerized ST-segment measurements were similar to visual ST-segment measurements made by cardiologists. Considering more than ST-segment measurements can enhance the diagnostic power of the exercise test.","Several case series have demonstrated that occult coronary heart disease (CHD) can be identified by screening asymptomatic adults with an EST, some of whom will ultimately experience coronary heart disease death. The best estimates of sensitivity and specificity of the exercise stress test for identifying occult coronary heart disease are 45% and 85%, respectively."
"Are breast self-exams or clinical exams effective for screening breast cancer
Breast self-examination and clinical breast examination have been promoted for many years as general screening methods to diagnose breast cancer at an earlier stage in order to decrease morbidity and or mortality. The possible benefits and harms remain unclear. To determine whether screening for breast cancer by regular self-examination or clinical breast examination reduces breast cancer mortality and morbidity. The Cochrane Library and Medline were searched for randomised trials; date of last search October 2002. The specialised register maintained by the Cochrane Breast Cancer Group was searched. Randomised clinical trials, including cluster randomised trials. Decisions on which trials to include were taken independently by the reviewers based on the methods of trial. Disagreements were resolved by discussion. Intention to treat analyses were conducted using a fixed effect model with 95% confidence intervals. Two large population-based studies (388,535 women) from Russia and Shanghai that compared breast self-examination with no intervention were included. There was no statistically significant difference in breast cancer mortality, relative risk 1.05 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.90 to 1.24) (587 deaths in total). In Russia, more cancers were found in the breast self-examination group than in the control group (relative risk 1.24, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.41), while this was not the case in Shanghai (relative risk 0.97, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.06). Almost twice as many biopsies (3406) with benign results were performed in the screening group compared to the control group (1856), relative risk 1.89, 95% CI 1.79 to 2.00. Data from two large trials do not suggest a beneficial effect of screening by breast self-examination whereas there is evidence for harms. There were no randomised trials of clinical breast examination. At present, breast self-examination cannot be recommended.","Two large RCTs, conducted in St Petersburg, Russia (122,471 women) and Shanghai, China (266,064 women), were found. Both studies used cluster randomization (by worksite) and involved large numbers of women who were meticulously trained in proper breast self-examination technique and had numerousreinforcement sessions. Study compliance and follow-up were excellent. Outcomes assessment was explicitly blinded in the Shanghai study. Neither trial demonstrated a reduction in breast cancer mortality or improvement in the number or stage of cancers detected during 9 to 11 years of follow-up, but there is evidence for harm: a nearly 2-fold increase in false-positive results, physician visits, and biopsies for benign disease."
"What is the risk of adverse outcomes in a woman who develops mild hypertension from OCs
To review new evidence regarding ten controversial issues in the use of contraceptive methods among women with special conditions and to present World Health Organization recommendations derived in part from this evidence. We searched MEDLINE and PREMEDLINE databases for English-language articles, published between January 1995 and December 2001, for evidence relevant to ten key contraceptive method and condition combinations: combined oral contraceptive (OC) use among women with hypertension or headaches, combined OC use for emergency contraception and adverse events, progestogen-only contraception use among young women and among breast-feeding women, tubal sterilization among young women, hormonal contraception and intrauterine device use among women who are human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive, have AIDS, or are at high risk of HIV infection. Search terms included: ""contraception,"" ""contraceptives, oral,"" ""progestational hormones,"" ""medroxyprogesterone-17 acetate,"" ""norethindrone,"" ""levonorgestrel,"" ""Norplant,"" ""contraceptives, postcoital,"" ""sterilization, tubal,"" ""intrauterine devices,"" ""hypertension,"" ""stroke,"" ""myocardial infarction,"" ""thrombosis,"" ""headache,"" ""migraine,"" ""adverse effects,"" ""bone mineral density,"" ""breast-feeding,"" ""lactation,"" ""age factors,"" ""regret,"" and ""HIV."" From 205 articles, we identified 33 studies published in peer-reviewed journals that specifically examined risks of contraceptive use among women with pre-existing conditions. Combined OC users with hypertension appear to be at increased risk of myocardial infarction and stroke relative to users without hypertension. Combined OC users with migraine appear to be at increased risk of stroke relative to nonusers with migraine. The evidence for the other eight method and condition combinations was either insufficient to draw conclusions or identified no excess risk. Of ten contraceptive method and condition combinations assessed, the evidence supported an increased risk of cardiovascular complications with combined OC use by women with hypertension or migraine. As new evidence becomes available, assessment of risk and recommendations for use of contraceptive methods can be revised accordingly.","A systematic review of 8 case control studies (with 4907 cases and 13,443 controls) found an increased risk of stroke and myocardial infarction among hypertensive women taking combined type OCs vs those not taking OCs. Women with hypertension aged 20 to 24 years had an estimated cardiovascular event risk of 312 per million woman-years while taking OCs vs 134 per million woman-years not taking OCs. Among hypertensive women aged 40 to 44 years, the estimated risks were 1213 vs 529 per million woman-years, respectively. Primary endpoints varied across the studies and statistical significance was not given."
"What is the best approach for patients with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance detected on Pap smear
Every year approximately 2 million US women are diagnosed as having a cervical cytological result of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US). To determine the most efficient and cost-effective management strategy for women in the United States diagnosed as having ASC-US. Cost-effectiveness analysis of data from clinical trials, prospective studies, and other published literature. A computer-based model was used to compare 4 management strategies for a cytological result of ASC-US: immediate colposcopy; human papillomavirus (HPV) triage, which includes colposcopy if high-risk HPV types are detected; repeat cytology, which includes follow-up cytology at 6 and 12 months and referral for colposcopy if a repeat abnormal result occurs; and reclassifying ASC-US as normal in which a cytological result of ASC-US is ignored. Reflex HPV DNA testing uses either residual liquid-based cytological specimens or samples co-collected at the time of the initial screening for conventional cytology. Another method, referred to as the 2-visit HPV DNA triage, requires a woman with an ASC-US result to return within 1 month to provide another speciman sample. Years of life saved (YLS), quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. The least costly strategy for biennial screening was to reclassify ASC-US as normal, resulting in a reduction in total cancer incidence of 75% for conventional cytology and 84% for liquid-based cytology compared with no screening. The next least costly strategy was HPV DNA testing resulting in a reduction in total cancer incidence of 86% for conventional cytology and 90% for liquid-based cytology, followed by immediate colposcopy with a reduction of 87% and 91%, respectively. Compared with reflex HPV DNA testing, a strategy of repeat cervical cytology or delayed HPV testing costs more but is less effective. When all strategies were compared simultaneously, varying frequency and type of cytological test, biennial (vs every 3 years) liquid-based cytology with reflex HPV testing had a cost of $174 200 per YLS. In a similar comparison, liquid-based cytology with reflex HPV testing conducted every 3 years (vs every 5 years) had a cost of $59 600 per YLS and was more effective and less costly than a strategy of conventional cytology incorporating repeat cytology or immediate colposcopy conducted biennially. Reflex HPV DNA testing provides the same or greater life expectancy benefits and is more cost-effective than other management strategies for women diagnosed as having ASC-US.",A cost-effectiveness analysis that modeled data from the ASCUS-LSIL Triage Study (ALTS) found that reflex HPV testing was most cost-effective.
"Does anticoagulation prevent thrombosis for persons with fractures distal to the hip
Our purpose was to determine the incidence of deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) in patients who have had early operative fixation of fractures of the lower extremity distal to the hip. There is a high incidence of distal thrombosis in patients who have undergone early operative fixation of lower-extremity fractures. The incidence of DVT is higher with proximal extremity fractures than with distal extremity fractures. Most clots are occult and do not progress clinically. Given the high incidence of DVT with femoral and tibial plateau fractures, older age, and longer operating times, anticoagulation prophylaxis may be indicated. Ours was a prospective incidence study. All patients who had had early operative fixation of lower-extremity fractures were eligible (n = 176). Seventy-four were excluded based on specific criteria. The remaining 102 patients underwent lower-extremity venography an average of 9 days after operative fixation of their fractures (range 3-22 days). Eight patients had bilateral lower-extremity fractures. The patients were followed clinically for 6 weeks to identify complications related to venous disease. The overall incidence of clinically occult DVT was 28%. Of the represented fractures, 40% were of the femoral shaft (eight of 20), 43% of the tibial plateau (12 of 28), 22% of the tibial shaft (12 of 54), and 12.5% of the tibial plafond (one of eight). Four of the thrombi were proximal to the popliteal fossa. Four of the patients had clinical evidence of pulmonary embolism while in the hospital. One of them had objective confirmation on further testing. No patient had clinical evidence of pulmonary emboli as an outpatient by follow-up criteria. The incidence of DVT has not been determined for patients with early stabilization of lower-extremity fractures. This study suggests a higher DVT incidence in more proximal fractures, but little risk of embolization. Thrombus formation proximal to the popliteal fossa is rare. Older age, longer operating times, and longer times before fracture fixation all correlate with an increased incidence of DVT.","Incidence of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism  was also evaluated in a cohort of 102 unselected patients who underwent operative fixation for lower-limb fractures, excluding patella, ankle, and foot fractures. All underwent venography approximately 9 days after fixation and were followed clinically for 6 weeks. The overall incidence of deep venous thrombosis was 28% (40% with femoral shaft, 43% with tibial plateau, 22% with tibial shaft, and 12% with tibial plafond [distal articular tibia]). Four developed clinical evidence of pulmonary embolism  during hospitalization but only 1 had objective confirmation. None of the patients showed clinical evidence of pulmonary embolism  as outpatients."
"What measures relieve postherpetic neuralgia
We wanted to determine whether any treatment had been shown to reduce pain or disability from postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), a common sequela of herpes zoster in elderly patients. We undertook a systematic review of English-language randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of treatments of PHN with evaluation periods longer than 24 hours. We systematically searched MEDLINE, Current Contents, and the Cochrane Library. We also searched reference lists of identified trials and reviews and contacted content experts. Two reviewers independently evaluated RCTs for methodologic quality and data extraction. Outcomes of primary focus were pain and quality of life. Twenty-seven RCTs met inclusion criteria and were reviewed. Six trials of tricyclic antidepressants found evidence for clinically meaningful effects over 6 weeks. All other treatments were evaluated in no more than 2 trials meeting our inclusion criteria. Topical capsaicin 0.075%, gabapentin, and controlled-release oxycodone were shown to be effective, but the clinically meaningful benefit is difficult to quantify. Intrathecal methylprednisolone and possibly bupivacaine sympathetic blocks are helpful in refractory cases. Other treatments evaluated, including topical lidocaine, had no evidence or inconsistent evidence of benefit. No single best treatment for PHN is known. Tricyclic antidepressants, topical capsaicin, gabapentin, and oxycodone are effective for alleviating PHN; however, long-term, clinically meaningful benefits are uncertain and side effects are common. Patients with PHN refractory to these therapies may benefit from intrathecal methylprednisolone. Little evidence is available regarding treatment of PHN of less than 6 months' duration.","A systematic review found that controlled-release oxycodone reduced pain by 50%, based on the VAS."
"Do statins reduce the risk of stroke
Previous overviews suggested that hydroxymethyl glutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins), but not other lipid-lowering therapy (LLT), may reduce stroke incidence in coronary patients. To investigate the amplitude and sources of heterogeneity of LLT effects on stroke prevention. We searched the literature from 1966 to 2001 and then conducted a meta-analysis including randomized trials of primary and secondary coronary heart disease prevention, testing statins, nonstatin drugs, diet, or other interventions and providing data on stroke incidence. The meta-analysis (38 trials, 83 161 patients, mean follow-up of 4.7 years) showed a significant relative risk reduction (RRR) of strokes by LLT of 17% (P<.001), without significant heterogeneity between trials and between subgroups according to either the type of prevention (primary or secondary) or the type of LLT. The most substantial effects were obtained, however, with statins (RRR, 26%). Effect model analysis showed that treatment benefit appeared constant whatever the risk of stroke, suggesting that LLT may be effective in a population with a higher risk of stroke. Weighted regression showed a significant correlation between RRR of stroke and total cholesterol levels (baseline, final, and change). Only final cholesterol allowed clear separation between benefit (RRR>0) and no effect (RRR<0) of LLT on stroke incidence, with a cutoff for benefit of 232 mg/dL (6.0 mmol/L). Lipid-lowering therapy reduces stroke incidence in coronary patients, especially when total cholesterol level is lowered to less than 232 mg/dL (6.0 mmol/L), which explains the best results being obtained with statins.","A meta-analysis of 15 randomized placebo-controlled trials using various statins (32,684 participants) assessed the risk of strokes for patients with a history of coronary disease. Among patients who had cerebrovascular disease, statins significantly reduced recurrent ischemic stroke (RR=0.74; 95% CI, 0.64-0.86). One recurrence of ischemic stroke would be prevented for every 110 coronary disease patients treated with a statin. Achieving final total cholesterol <232 mg/dL correlated with reduced risk of recurrent stroke. Three of the studies evaluated primary prevention of stroke and did not show a significant risk reduction (RR=0.85; P=.4). Statins did not reduce the rate of hemorrhagic stroke or fatal strokes."
"How does colonoscopy compare with fecal occult blood testing as a screening tool for colon cancer
To assess the effectiveness of different colorectal cancer screening tests for adults at average risk. Recent systematic reviews; Guide to Clinical Preventive Services, 2nd edition; and focused searches of MEDLINE from 1966 through September 2001. The authors also conducted hand searches, reviewed bibliographies, and consulted context experts to ensure completeness. When available, the most recent high-quality systematic review was used to identify relevant articles. This review was then supplemented with a MEDLINE search for more recent articles. One reviewer abstracted information from the final set of studies into evidence tables, and a second reviewer checked the tables for accuracy. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus. For average-risk adults older than 50 years of age, evidence from multiple well-conducted randomized trials supported the effectiveness of fecal occult blood testing in reducing colorectal cancer incidence and mortality rates compared with no screening. Data from well-conducted case-control studies supported the effectiveness of sigmoidoscopy and possibly colonoscopy in reducing colon cancer incidence and mortality rates. A nonrandomized, controlled trial examining colorectal cancer mortality rates and randomized trials examining diagnostic yield supported the use of fecal occult blood testing plus sigmoidoscopy. The effectiveness of barium enema is unclear. Data are insufficient to support a definitive determination of the most effective screening strategy. Colorectal cancer screening reduces death from colorectal cancer and can decrease the incidence of disease through removal of adenomatous polyps. Several available screening options seem to be effective, but the single best screening approach cannot be determined because data are insufficient.","A systematic review performed for the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) incorporated more recent data on colorectal cancer screening including colonoscopy. This review reached similar conclusions as above. This review also looked at office fecal occult blood test performed after digital rectal exam. It is important to note that a single office fecal occult blood test has a lower sensitivity than 3-card home fecal occult blood test and its effectiveness for reducing colorectal cancer mortality was unknown at the time of the systematic review. The us preventive services task force review also looked at the sensitivity and adverse effects of fecal occult blood test compared to colonoscopy. One-time 3-card home fecal occult blood test had a sensitivity of 30% to 40% for detecting cancer. The sensitivity of one-time colonoscopy was difficult to determine since it was the criterion standard examination, but it was estimated to be greater than 90%, with a risk of perforation of 1/2000."
"Should patients with acute deep venous thrombosis limit activity
The aim of the present study was to evaluate weather early supervised exercise improves recanalization of acute deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and reduces symptoms. From September 2001 to March 2004, of 381 patients, 72 eligible patients were included and with a mean age 54 +/- 14 years, 39 (52%) men with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) proven with phlebography were randomized to: an exercise group (n = 36) receiving routine anticoagulation, class II compression stockings and additionally supervised exercise and a control group (n = 36) receiving the same therapy but no exercise. Patients were followed-up during six months. Phlebography was scored initially and at six-months. There were at inclusion no differences between the two groups regarding age, body weight, body mass index (BMI), calf circumference of the affected leg, and overall quality of life estimated by visual analog scale (VAS)-scale. In both groups there were significant reductions regarding calf circumference in the affected leg compared to the inclusion time, both at one-month (P = 0.0012) and six month (P = 0.0002) follow-up. The degree of recanalization of the affected venous segments was high and did not differ between groups. There were no recurrent DVT or pulmonary emboli or other treatment complications in any individual during the six-month follow-up period. Early exercise did not acutely exacerbate the risk of complications in patients with DVT. No benefits of early exercise were seen regarding the degree of recanalization of the thrombi, or faster resolution of pain or swelling. Nevertheless, our study shows that early exercise/ambulation is safe in combination with anticoagulation and compression stockings for the majority of patients with DVT.",RCTs in which both ambulating and resting patients received compression therapy showed no significant difference in leg circumference at 1 or 6 months. This finding suggests that the benefit on local symptoms may result from compression rather than ambulation.
"What are effective strategies for reducing the risk of steroid-induced osteoporosis
To assess the effects of calcium and vitamin D compared to calcium alone or placebo in the prevention of bone loss in patients taking systemic corticosteroids. We searched the Cochrane Musculoskeletal trials register, Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, EMBASE and Medline up to 1996. We also conducted a hand search of abstracts from various scientific meetings and reference lists of selected trials. All randomized trials comparing calcium and vitamin D to calcium alone or placebo in patients taking systemic corticosteroids. Data was abstracted from trials by two investigators. Methodological quality was assessed in a similar manner. Analysis was performed using fixed effects models. Five trials were included, with 274 patients. The analysis was performed at two years after starting calcium and vitamin D. There was a significant weighted mean difference (WMD) between treatment and control groups in lumbar (WMD 2.6 (95% CI 0.7, 4.5), and radial bone mineral density (WMD 2.5 (95% CI 0.6, 4.4). The other outcome measures (femoral neck bone mass, fracture incidence, biochemical markers of bone resorption) were not significantly different. This meta-analysis demonstrated a clinically and statistically significant prevention of bone loss at the lumbar spine and forearm with vitamin D and calcium in corticosteroid treated patients. Because of low toxicity and cost all patients being started on corticosteroids should receive prophylactic therapy with calcium and vitamin D.",A systematic review of 5 RCTs (N=274) confirmed clinically and statistically significant prevention of bone loss at the lumbar spine for patients receiving glucocorticoids who also received calcium (500-1000 mg daily) and vitamin D (400-800 IU) daily.
"What is the best initial treatment for orbital cellulitis in children
A prospective study was carried out by the Department of Ophthalmology and the Division of Infectious Disease at the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario to assess the outcome of our medical management of orbital cellulitis in children using a predetermined antibiotic regimen and to determine whether computed tomographic (CT) evidence of a subperiosteal abscess alone was an indication for surgical drainage. Between February 1985 and January 1988, 23 patients with true orbital cellulitis were admitted. CT scans were ordered routinely at the time of admission. The scans were cancelled for 13 children because they responded rapidly to medical management. CT showed edema nasal to the medial rectus, or thickening or displacement of the muscle in 8 of the 10 children who underwent the procedure. Three children required sinus and orbital drainage, but frank purulent material was found subperiosteally in only one. The results suggest that most children with orbital cellulitis can be managed with the prompt use of the appropriate intravenous antibiotics. Therapy with cloxacillin sodium and chloramphenicol or, in children under age 6 years, cefuroxime best covers the spectrum of organisms responsible for most cases of orbital cellulitis in children. CT should be used as an ancillary guide to the need for surgical exploration of the orbit in patients who do not rapidly respond to medical management.","In a prospective study to evaluate medical management (n=23), 87% of patients responded to intravenous antibiotics."
"What are the best treatments for herpes labialis
Oral valacyclovir is better absorbed than oral acyclovir, increasing acyclovir bioavailability three- to fivefold. This provides the opportunity to explore whether high systemic acyclovir concentrations are effective in the treatment of cold sores (herpes labialis). Two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies were conducted. Subjects were provided with 2 g of valacyclovir twice daily for 1 day (1-day treatment), 2 g of valacyclovir twice daily for 1 day and then 1 g of valacyclovir twice daily for 1 day (2-day treatment), or a matching placebo and instructed to initiate treatment upon the first symptoms of a cold sore. In study 1, the median duration of the episode (primary endpoint) was reduced by 1.0 day (P = 0.001) with 1-day treatment and 0.5 days (P = 0.009) with 2-day treatment compared to placebo. Similarly, the mean duration of the episode was statistically significantly reduced by 1.1 days with 1-day treatment and 0.7 days with 2-day treatment compared to placebo. The proportion of subjects in whom cold sore lesion development was prevented and/or blocked was increased by 6.4% (P = 0.096) with 1-day treatment and 8.5% (P = 0.061) with 2-day treatment compared to placebo. The time to lesion healing and time to cessation of pain and/or discomfort were statistically significantly reduced with valacyclovir compared to placebo. In study 2, results similar to those in study 1 were obtained. AEs were similar across treatment groups. These studies provide evidence supporting a simple, 1-day valacyclovir treatment regimen for cold sores that is safe and effective. The 1-day valacyclovir regimen offers patients a unique and convenient dosing alternative compared to available topical therapies.","Two RCTs have shown that valacyclovir (the prodrug of acyclovir, which has 3 to 5 times greater bioavailability) at a dosage of 2 g twice in 1 day significantly decreased the episode duration and time to lesion healing compared with placebo. In the first study (n=603), the mean episode duration was decreased by 1.1 days (5.0 vs 6.1 days; 95% confidence interval [CI], -1.6 to -0.6); in the second study (n=615) by 1.0 day (5.3 vs 6.3 days; 95% CI, -1.0 to -0.5)."

"How effective are nasal steroids combined with nonsedating antihistamines for seasonal allergic rhinitis
To determine whether intranasal corticosteroids are superior to oral H1 receptor antagonists (antihistamines) in the treatment of allergic rhinitis. Meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials comparing intranasal corticosteroids with oral antihistamines. Randomised controlled trials conducted worldwide and published between 1966 and 1997. 2267 subjects with allergic rhinitis in 16 randomised controlled trials. Nasal blockage, nasal discharge, sneezing, nasal itch, postnasal drip, nasal discomfort, total nasal symptoms, nasal resistance, and eye symptoms and global ratings. Outcomes measured on different scales were combined to determine pooled odds ratios (categorical outcomes) or standardised mean differences (continuous outcomes). Assessment of heterogeneity between studies, and subgroup analyses of eye symptoms, were undertaken. Intranasal corticosteroids produced significantly greater relief than oral antihistamines of nasal blockage (standardised mean difference 0.63, 95% confidence interval - 0.73 to - 0.53), nasal discharge (-0.5, - 0.6 to - 0.4), sneezing (- 0.49, - 0.59 to - 0.39), nasal itch (- 0.38,- 0.49 to - 0.21), postnasal drip (- 0.24,- 0.42 to - 0.06), and total nasal symptoms (- 0.42,- 0.53 to - 0.32), and global ratings gave an odds ratio for deterioration of symptoms of 0.26 (0.08 to 0.8). There were no significant differences between treatments for nasal discomfort, nasal resistance, or eye symptoms. The effects on sneezing, total nasal symptoms, and eye symptoms were significantly heterogeneous between studies. Other combined outcomes were homogeneous between studies. Subgroup analysis of the outcome of eye symptoms suggested that the duration of assessment (averaged mean score over the study period versus mean score at end of study period) might have accounted for the heterogeneity. The results of this systematic review, together with data on safety and cost effectiveness, support the use of intranasal corticosteroids over oral antihistamines as first line treatment for allergic rhinitis.","A meta-analysis of 16 RCTs compared the efficacy of intranasal steroids and oral antihistamines for alleviating nasal, eye, and global allergy symptoms. Intranasal steroids were superior to oral antihistamines for all patient-oriented nasal symptom and global symptom ratings. Eye symptom scores and adverse events were similar in each treatment group."
"Which lifestyle interventions effectively lower low density lipoprotein cholesterol
The authors used the meta-analytic approach to examine the effects of aerobic exercise on lipids and lipoproteins in adults 50 years of age and older. Twenty-eight outcomes representing 1427 subjects (806 exercise, 621 control) were available for pooling. Random-effects modeling yielded statistically significant improvements of 1.1%, 5.6%, 2.5%, and 7.1%, respectively, for total cholesterol (mean +/- SEM in mg/dL, -3.3+/-1.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], -6.5 to -0.02; p=0.05), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (2.5+/-1.0; 95% CI, 0.7-4.4; p=0.01), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (-3.9+/-1.9; 95% CI, -7.7 to -0.08; p=0.05), ratio of total cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (-0.8+/-0.2; 95% CI, -1.2 to -0.4; p<0.001), but not triglycerides (-7.0+/-3.6; 95% CI, -14.0 to 0.1; p=0.06). After conducting sensitivity analyses, only the improvements in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and the ratio of total cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol remained statistically significant (p<0.05 for both). It was concluded that aerobic exercise increases high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and decreases the ratio of total cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in older adults.",Aerobic exercise effectively lowers LDL-C. This reduction is enhanced by weight loss and diet and mitigated by weight gain. An analysis of 4 RCTs showed that LDL-C also decreased with resistance training.
"What interventions reduce the risk of contrast nephropathy for high-risk patients
The use of iodinated contrast medium can result in nephropathy. Whether iso-osmolar contrast medium is less nephrotoxic than low-osmolar contrast medium in high-risk patients is uncertain. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, prospective, multicenter study comparing the nephrotoxic effects of an iso-osmolar, dimeric, nonionic contrast medium, iodixanol, with those of a low-osmolar, nonionic, monomeric contrast medium, iohexol. The study involved 129 patients with diabetes with serum creatinine concentrations of 1.5 to 3.5 mg per deciliter who underwent coronary or aortofemoral angiography. The primary end point was the peak increase from base line in the creatinine concentration during the three days after angiography. Other end points were an increase in the creatinine concentration of 0.5 mg per deciliter or more, an increase of 1.0 mg per deciliter or more, and a change in the creatinine concentration from day 0 to day 7. The creatinine concentration increased significantly less in patients who received iodixanol. From day 0 to day 3, the mean peak increase in creatinine was 0.13 mg per deciliter in the iodixanol group and 0.55 mg per deciliter in the iohexol group (P=0.001; the increase with iodixanol minus the increase with iohexol, -0.42 mg per deciliter [95 percent confidence interval, -0.73 to -0.22]). Two of the 64 patients in the iodixanol group (3 percent) had an increase in the creatinine concentration of 0.5 mg per deciliter or more, as compared with 17 of the 65 patients in the iohexol group (26 percent) (P=0.002; odds ratio for such an increase in the iodixanol group, 0.09 [95 percent confidence interval, 0.02 to 0.41]). No patient receiving iodixanol had an increase of 1.0 mg per deciliter or more, but 10 patients in the iohexol group (15 percent) did. The mean change in the creatinine concentration from day 0 to day 7 was 0.07 mg per deciliter in the iodixanol group and 0.24 mg per deciliter in the iohexol group (P=0.003; value in the iodixanol group minus the value in the iohexol group, -0.17 mg per deciliter [95 percent confidence interval, -0.34 to -0.07]). Nephropathy induced by contrast medium may be less likely to develop in high-risk patients when iodixanol is used rather than a low-osmolar, nonionic contrast medium.",A single study suggested that iso-osmolar contrast media generate less contrast induced nephropathy than low-osmolar contrast media.
"Do statins delay onset or slow progression of Alzheimer's dementia
Lower blood cholesterol concentrations have consistently been found to be strongly associated with lower risks of coronary disease but not with lower risks of stroke. Despite this observation, previous randomised trials had indicated that cholesterol-lowering statin therapy reduces the risk of stroke, but large-scale prospective confirmation has been needed. 3280 adults with cerebrovascular disease, and an additional 17256 with other occlusive arterial disease or diabetes, were randomly allocated 40 mg simvastatin daily or matching placebo. Subgroup analyses were prespecified of first ""major vascular event"" (ie, non-fatal myocardial infarction or coronary death, stroke of any type, or any revascularisation procedure) in prior disease subcategories. Subsidiary outcomes included any stroke, and stroke sub-type. Comparisons are of all simvastatin-allocated versus all placebo-allocated participants (ie, ""intention-to-treat""), which yielded an average difference in LDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L (39 mg/dL) during the 5-year treatment period. Overall, there was a highly significant 25% (95% CI 15-34) proportional reduction in the first event rate for stroke (444 [4.3%] simvastatin vs 585 [5.7%] placebo; p<0.0001), reflecting a definite 28% (19-37) reduction in presumed ischaemic strokes (p<0.0001) and no apparent difference in strokes attributed to haemorrhage (51 [0.5%] vs 53 [0.5%]; rate ratio 0.95 [0.65-1.40]; p=0.8). In addition, simvastatin reduced the numbers having transient cerebral ischaemic attacks alone (2.0% vs 2.4%; p=0.02) or requiring carotid endarterectomy or angioplasty (0.4% vs 0.8%; p=0.0003). The reduction in stroke was not significant during the first year, but was already significant (p=0.0004) by the end of the second year. Among patients with pre-existing cerebrovascular disease there was no apparent reduction in the stroke rate, but there was a highly significant 20% (8-29) reduction in the rate of any major vascular event (406 [24.7%] vs 488 [29.8%]; p=0.001). The proportional reductions in stroke were about one-quarter in each of the other subcategories of participant studied, including: those with coronary disease or diabetes; those aged under or over 70 years at entry; and those presenting with different levels of blood pressure or lipids (even when the pretreatment LDL cholesterol was below 3.0 mmol/L [116 mg/dL]). Much larger numbers of people in the present study suffered a stroke than in any previous cholesterol-lowering trial. The results demonstrate that statin therapy rapidly reduces the incidence not only of coronary events but also of ischaemic strokes, with no apparent effect on cerebral haemorrhage, even among individuals who do not have high cholesterol concentrations. Allocation to 40 mg simvastatin daily reduced the rate of ischaemic strokes by about one-quarter and so, after making allowance for non-compliance in the trial, actual use of this regimen would probably reduce the stroke rate by about a third. HPS also provides definitive evidence that statin therapy is beneficial for people with pre-existing cerebrovascular disease, even if they do not already have manifest coronary disease.","The largest randomized controlled trials of a statin agent, the Heart Protection Study, enrolled more than 20,000 people and randomized them to simvastatin Zocor or placebo. After a median of 5 years of follow-up, there was no difference in cognitive scores or the rate of diagnosis of dementia between the 2 groups."
"When and how should you evaluate a child for obstructive sleep apnea
This clinical practice guideline, intended for use by primary care clinicians, provides recommendations for the diagnosis and management of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). The Section on Pediatric Pulmonology of the American Academy of Pediatrics selected a subcommittee composed of pediatricians and other experts in the fields of pulmonology and otolaryngology as well as experts from epidemiology and pediatric practice to develop an evidence base of literature on this topic. The resulting evidence report was used to formulate recommendations for the diagnosis and management of childhood OSAS. The guideline contains the following recommendations for the diagnosis of OSAS: 1) all children should be screened for snoring; 2) complex high-risk patients should be referred to a specialist; 3) patients with cardiorespiratory failure cannot await elective evaluation; 4) diagnostic evaluation is useful in discriminating between primary snoring and OSAS, the gold standard being polysomnography; 5) adenotonsillectomy is the first line of treatment for most children, and continuous positive airway pressure is an option for those who are not candidates for surgery or do not respond to surgery; 6) high-risk patients should be monitored as inpatients postoperatively; 7) patients should be reevaluated postoperatively to determine whether additional treatment is required. This clinical practice guideline is not intended as a sole source of guidance in the evaluation of children with OSAS. Rather, it is designed to assist primary care clinicians by providing a framework for diagnostic decision-making. It is not intended to replace clinical judgment or to establish a protocol for all children with this condition and may not provide the only appropriate approach to this problem.",Experts consider overnight polysomnography to be the gold standard test for obstructive sleep apnea. Physical examination alone usually has normal results.
"Does warfarin prevent deep venous thrombosis in high-risk patients
Standard therapy to prevent recurrent venous thromboembolism includes 3 to 12 months of treatment with full-dose warfarin with a target international normalized ratio (INR) between 2.0 and 3.0. However, for long-term management, no therapeutic agent has shown an acceptable benefit-to-risk ratio. Patients with idiopathic venous thromboembolism who had received full-dose anticoagulation therapy for a median of 6.5 months were randomly assigned to placebo or low-intensity warfarin (target INR, 1.5 to 2.0). Participants were followed for recurrent venous thromboembolism, major hemorrhage, and death. The trial was terminated early after 508 patients had undergone randomization and had been followed for up to 4.3 years (mean, 2.1). Of 253 patients assigned to placebo, 37 had recurrent venous thromboembolism (7.2 per 100 person-years), as compared with 14 of 255 patients assigned to low-intensity warfarin (2.6 per 100 person-years), a risk reduction of 64 percent (hazard ratio, 0.36 [95 percent confidence interval, 0.19 to 0.67]; P<0.001). Risk reductions were similar for all subgroups, including those with and those without inherited thrombophilia. Major hemorrhage occurred in two patients assigned to placebo and five assigned to low-intensity warfarin (P=0.25). Eight patients in the placebo group and four in the group assigned to low-intensity warfarin died (P=0.26). Low-intensity warfarin was thus associated with a 48 percent reduction in the composite end point of recurrent venous thromboembolism, major hemorrhage, or death. According to per-protocol and as-treated analyses, the reduction in the risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism was between 76 and 81 percent. Long-term, low-intensity warfarin therapy is a highly effective method of preventing recurrent venous thromboembolism.","Warfarin, at both low and conventional doses, has been shown to be effective in preventing recurrence of DVT. A large, 4-year placebo-controlled randomized controlled trial showed that long-term low-dose warfarin international normalized ratio [INR], 1.5-1.9 was more effective than placebo for prevention of deep venous thrombosis hazard ratio=0.36; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.19-0.67."
"Which treatments are effective for cervical radiculopathy
To investigate the outcomes resulting from the use of fluoroscopically guided therapeutic selective nerve root block (SNRB) in the nonsurgical treatment of atraumatic cervical spondylotic radicular pain. Retrospective study with independent clinical review. Twenty subjects (10 men, 10 women) with mean age 56.6 years. Each patient met specific physical examination, radiographic, and electrodiagnostic criteria to confirm a level of cervical involvement. Those patients whose root level remained indeterminate were required to demonstrate a positive response to a fluoroscopically guided diagnostic SNRB prior to the initiation of treatment. Therapeutic injections were administered in conjunction with physical therapy. Data collection and analysis were performed by an independent clinical reviewer. Pain score, work status, medication usage, and patient satisfaction. Twenty patients with an average symptom duration of 5.8 months were included. An average of 2.2 therapeutic injections was administered. Follow-up data collection transpired at an average of 21.2 months following discharge from treatment. A significant reduction (p = .001) in pain score was observed at the time of follow-up. Medication usage was also significantly improved (p = .005) at the time of follow-up. An overall good or excellent result was observed in 60%. Thirty percent of patients required surgery. Younger patients were more likely (p = .0047) to report the highest patient satisfaction rating following treatment. This study suggests that fluoroscopically guided therapeutic SNRB is a clinically effective intervention in the treatment of atraumatic cervical spondylotic radicular pain.",One case series of cortisone epidural injections reported 60% of patients (12 of 20) had good or excellent response at long-term follow-up (mean follow-up=21.2 months; range=2-45 months). Six of the 20 patients proceeded to surgery.
"What is the best way to manage phantom limb pain
Severe phantom limb pain after surgical amputation affects 50% to 67% of patients and is difficult to treat. Gabapentin is effective in several syndromes of neuropathic pain. Therefore, we evaluated its analgesic efficacy in phantom limb pain. Patients attending a multidisciplinary pain clinic with phantom limb pain were enrolled into this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study. Other anticonvulsant therapy was discontinued. Each treatment was 6 weeks separated by a 1-week washout period. Codeine/paracetamol was allowed as rescue analgesia. The daily dose of gabapentin was titrated in increments of 300 mg to 2400 mg or the maximum tolerated dose. Patients were assessed at weekly intervals. The primary outcome measure was visual analog scale (VAS) pain intensity difference (PID) compared with baseline at the end of each treatment. Secondary measures were indices of sleep interference, depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression [HAD] scale), and activities of daily living (Bartel Index). Nineteen eligible patients (mean age, 56 years; range, 24 to 68 years; 16 men) were randomized, of whom 14 completed both arms of the study. Both placebo and gabapentin treatments resulted in reduced VAS scores compared with baseline. PID was significantly greater than placebo for gabapentin therapy at the end of the treatment (3.2 +/- 2.1 v 1.6 +/- 0.7, P =.03). There were no significant differences between placebo and gabapentin therapy in terms of the number of tablets of rescue medication required, sleep interference, HAD scale, or Bartel Index. The medication was well tolerated with few reports of adverse effects. After 6 weeks, gabapentin monotherapy was better than placebo in relieving postamputation phantom limb pain. There were no significant differences in mood, sleep interference, or activities of daily living, but a type II error cannot be excluded for these variables.",One 2002 randomized controlled trials showed benefit regarding an improvement of the visual analog scale by an average of 3 points (on a 10-point scale) after 6 weeks of gabapentin therapy.
"Which tests are the most useful for diagnosing pelvic inflammatory disease
The objective of this study was to compare the demographic, clinical, and microbiologic findings in women with subclinical pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and women with acute PID. A cross-sectional study was performed using cohorts from 2 separate studies of 1293 women at risk for PID. Most participants were recruited from emergency departments, sexually transmitted disease clinics, and family planning clinics in metropolitan centers. We compared demographic, clinical, and microbiologic findings among women with acute PID, women with subclinical PID, and women without endometritis (controls). Statistical analyses included chi-square for categorical variables, calculation of odds ratio and 95% confidence intervals, and polychotomous logistic regression when appropriate. Similar proportions of women with acute and subclinical PID tested positive for cervical Chlamydia trachomatis (odds ratio [OR], 1.1; 95% confidence interval, 0.6-2.0) and had bacterial vaginosis (OR, 0.7; 95% CI, 0.2-1.8). The rate of cervical Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection in women with subclinical PID was intermediate between the rates in women with acute PID and controls (21% vs. 49% vs. 7%, respectively, P <0.001, test for trend). Endometrial recovery of N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis in women with subclinical PID was also seen at intermediate levels. Similar distributions of teenagers, women who smoked or used illicit drugs, and women engaging in sexual intercourse during menses were found in each group. Proportions of women with subclinical PID who were black and with lower education levels were intermediate between the proportions of these characteristics in women with acute PID and controls. Demographic and microbiologic characteristics of women with subclinical and acute PID are comparable. These findings suggest that the pathophysiological mechanisms of acute and subclinical PID are similar.",Analysis of a trial suggests that some asymptomatic women are at equivalent risk of developing sequelae compared with symptomatic women diagnosed with PID. Those asymptomatic women who met diagnostic criteria with a positive endometrial biopsy were more likely to have pelvic tenderness than asymptomatic women who were not diagnosed.
"Does early detection of suspected atherosclerotic renovascular hypertension change outcomes
The optimal treatment for hypertensive patients with atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis is controversial. We performed a meta-analysis comparing the effects of balloon angioplasty and medical therapy in these patients. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Science Citation Index, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Registry, and reference lists. Authors of published trials were contacted. We identified three trials involving a total of 210 patients with moderate-to-severe (> or = 50%) unilateral or bilateral atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis and poorly controlled hypertension who were followed for at least 3 months after intervention. Balloon angioplasty was significantly more effective in reducing blood pressure than was medical therapy; the weighted mean difference between the two treatments was -7 mm Hg (95% confidence interval [CI]: -12 to -1 mm Hg) for systolic blood pressure and -3 mm Hg (95% CI: -6 to -1 mm Hg) for diastolic blood pressure. There was no consistent difference in changes in renal function. Patients treated with balloon angioplasty were more likely to have patent renal arteries after 12 months (52% vs. 19%; odds ratio [OR] = 4.2; 95% CI: 1.8 to 9.8), used fewer antihypertensive medications, and appeared to have fewer major cardiovascular and renovascular complications (OR = 0.27; 95% CI: 0.06 to 1.23; P = 0.09). Balloon angioplasty has a modest but significant effect on blood pressure and should be considered for patients with atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis and poorly controlled hypertension. There is no evidence supporting its use in improving or preserving renal function, although none of the trials were designed to address this issue.","A meta-analysis (3 RCTs, total n=210 patients) examining balloon angioplasty for renal artery stenosis and poorly controlled hypertension showed modest but significant effect on blood pressure control.1 Comparing the angioplasty group with medical management, the mean reduction in blood pressure was -7 mm Hg systolic (95% confidence interval [CI], -12 to -1) and -3 mm Hg diastolic (95% CI, -6 to -1). Patients treated with balloon angioplasty were more likely to use fewer antihypertensive medications (unable to synthesize data for quantity) and to have fewer major cardiovascular and renovascular complications (not defined specifically) (odds ratio [OR]=0.27; 95% CI, 0.06-1.23; P=.09)."
"What's the best treatment for pyogenic granuloma
Pyogenic granuloma is a benign vascular lesion of the skin and mucous membranes. Many different treatments have been used, with variable success rates. To evaluate and compare the effects of cryotherapy and curettage in the treatment of pyogenic granuloma. Eighty-nine patients with pyogenic granuloma were randomized to receive cryotherapy with liquid nitrogen or curettage and electrodesiccation. Forty patients in the cryotherapy group and 36 patients in the curettage group completed the study period. Among the patients who completed the study, treatment resulted in complete resolution of all lesions after one to three sessions (mean 1.42) in the cryotherapy group and after one to two sessions (mean 1.03) in the curettage group. The difference between the two groups was statistically significant (P < 0.001). Twenty-three patients (57.5%) in the cryotherapy group and 25 patients (69%) in the curettage group had no scar or pigmentation abnormality. Except for cosmetic problems, no other side-effect or complication was recorded in the study. This study showed that both cryotherapy and curettage are safe and effective. Curettage had the advantage of fewer treatment sessions required to achieve resolution and better cosmetic results. We suggest that curettage could be the first-line treatment for pyogenic granuloma.","A prospective trial randomized 89 patients (mean age 34 years; range 11-88 years) with pyogenic granulomas that were 1.5 cm or smaller to receive either curettage or cryotherapy, then evaluated the number of treatments required and whether scarring occurred. Follow-up was 85%. A single curettage resolved pyogenic granuloma in 35 of 36 patients (97%); 9 of the 36 patients (31%) had residual scarring. Twenty-five of 40 pyogenic granulomas (63%) responded to 1 cryotherapy treatment, 13 lesions (32%) resolved after 2 treatments, and 2 (5%) resolved after 3 treatments; 17 of the 40 patients (42.5%) had a residual scar. Curettage required fewer treatments overall than cryotherapy (P<.001), but no significant difference in residual scarring was noted between the 2 treatments."
"Does reducing smoking in the home protect children from the effects of second-hand smoke
To examine (1) whether dust and surfaces in households of smokers are contaminated with environmental tobacco smoke (ETS); (2) whether smoking parents can protect their infants by smoking outside and away from the infant; and (3) whether contaminated dust, surfaces, and air contribute to ETS exposure in infants. Quasi-experiment comparing three types of households with infants: (1) non-smokers who believe they have protected their children from ETS; (2) smokers who believe they have protected their children from ETS; (3) smokers who expose their children to ETS. Homes of smokers and non-smokers. Smoking and non-smoking mothers and their infants < or = 1 year. ETS contamination as measured by nicotine in household dust, indoor air, and household surfaces. ETS exposure as measured by cotinine levels in infant urine. ETS contamination and ETS exposure were 5-7 times higher in households of smokers trying to protect their infants by smoking outdoors than in households of non-smokers. ETS contamination and exposure were 3-8 times higher in households of smokers who exposed their infants to ETS by smoking indoors than in households of smokers trying to protect their children by smoking outdoors. Dust and surfaces in homes of smokers are contaminated with ETS. Infants of smokers are at risk of ETS exposure in their homes through dust, surfaces, and air. Smoking outside the home and away from the infant reduces but does not completely protect a smoker's home from ETS contamination and a smoker's infant from ETS exposure.","A study recruited a convenience sample of 49 interested families with a smoking mother and a nonbreastfeeding infant between 2 and 12 months of age. Families were classified by smoking history into one of 3 groups: nonsmoking households, smoking households where efforts were made to limit smoke exposure, and smoking households where no efforts were made to limit exposure. Urine samples were obtained 3 times over 1 week. Urine cotinine levels in infants averaged 0.33 ng/mL in nonsmoking households, 2.47 ng/mL in smoking households with limited exposure, and 15.47 ng/mL in smoking households with unlimited exposure (P<.001 for all comparisons)."
"When should patients with asymptomatic aortic stenosis be evaluated for valve replacement
Only limited data on the rate of hemodynamic progression and predictors of outcome in asymptomatic patients with valvular aortic stenosis (AS) are available. In 123 adults (mean age, 63 +/- 16 years) with asymptomatic AS, annual clinical, echocardiographic, and exercise data were obtained prospectively (mean follow-up of 2.5 +/- 1.4 years). Aortic jet velocity increased by 0.32 +/- 0.34 m/s per year and mean gradient by 7 +/- 7 mm Hg per year; valve area decreased by 0.12 +/- 0.19 cm2 per year. Kaplan-Meier event-free survival, with end points defined as death (n = 8) or aortic valve surgery (n = 48), was 93 +/- 5% at 1 year, 62 +/- 8% at 3 years, and 26 +/- 10% at 5 years. Univariate predictors of outcome included baseline jet velocity, mean gradient, valve area, and the rate of increase in jet velocity (all P < or = .001) but not age, sex, or cause of AS. Those with an end point had a smaller exercise increase in valve area, blood pressure, and cardiac output and a greater exercise decrease in stroke volume. Multivariate predictors of outcome were jet velocity at baseline (P < .0001), the rate of change in jet velocity (P < .0001), and functional status score (P = .002). The likelihood of remaining alive without valve replacement at 2 years was only 21 +/- 18% for a jet velocity at entry > 4.0 m/s, compared with 66 +/- 13% for a velocity of 3.0 to 4.0 m/s and 84 +/- 16% for a jet velocity < 3.0 m/s (P < .0001). In adults with asymptomatic AS, the rate of hemodynamic progression and clinical outcome are predicted by jet velocity, the rate of change in jet velocity, and functional status.",One prospective study found the severity of stenosis at baseline to be the strongest prognostic predictor. Patients with a jet velocity of < 3.0 m/s were unlikely to develop symptoms within 5 years; those with a jet velocity of 4.0 m/s had a > 50% likelihood of developing symptoms or dying within 2 years.
"How do we decide when a patient with nonmalignant disease is eligible for hospice care
Many proponents of hospice care believe that this service is underutilized. To determine physicians' perceptions of hospice utilization and of their own hospice referral pattern; their perceived and actual knowledge of appropriate hospice referral diagnoses; and perceived barriers to hospice referral. Surveys for anonymous response were distributed to 125 physicians in 2 internal medicine departments of a large not-for-profit health maintenance organization (HMO). Of these 125 physicians, 89% responded, including 91 staff physicians and 20 residents. Of the 111 physician-respondents, 78% reported their belief that hospice care was underutilized; 84% were unable to identify appropriate hospice diagnoses; and 12% were aware of the ""National Hospice Organization Medical Guidelines for Determining Prognosis in Selected Non-Cancer Diseases."" Difficulty of predicting death to within 6 months was cited by 37% as the foremost barrier to hospice referral. In addition, 28% expressed concern that patients or families would interpret hospice referral as a cost saving measure; 11% of respondents had been accused of using hospice referral for this purpose. Our study-the first major survey of physician attitudes and practices regarding hospice utilization in an HMO setting-showed that barriers to hospice referral are similar to those in non-HMO settings; physicians have difficulty predicting life expectancy and lack knowledge of patient eligibility guidelines. Physician concern that patients or their family members would construe hospice referral as a cost-saving technique may be a barrier particularly troublesome in an HMO setting.","Brickner et al's survey demonstrated that physicians find accurate prognostication difficult. Furthermore, many of the common noncancer diseases have erratic and unpredictable courses, making prognosis even harder."
"What treatments prevent miscarriage after recurrent pregnancy loss
Early pregnancies in women with a history of recurrent spontaneous abortion (RSA) are accompanied by a deficiency in vasodilatory and anti-aggregatory prostacyclin (PGI2) and/or overproduction of its endogenous antagonist thromboxane A2 (TXA2). We evaluated the effect of a low-dose aspirin (LDA) on PGI2 and TXA2 production and on pregnancy outcome in RSA women with and without detectable anticardiolipin antibodies (ACA). Of 82 RSA women studied, 66 became pregnant, and of them, 33 (six with elevated and 27 with normal ACA concentrations) were randomized to receive LDA (50 mg/day) and 33 (six with elevated and 27 with normal ACA concentrations) to receive placebo (PLA) from a mean of 6.6 days after the missed period to delivery. Treatment with LDA inhibited platelet TXA2 production similarly in RSA women with and without detectable ACA and with continuing pregnancies (7.0 +/- 0.7 ng/ml, LDA group versus 254.5 +/- 37.8 ng/ml, PLA group, mean +/- SEM, P < 0.0001) or miscarrying pregnancies (13.8 +/- 3.8 ng/ml compared with 233.6 +/- 59.8 ng/ml, P < 0.0001 respectively). Furthermore, LDA decreased urinary excretion of the TXA2 metabolite (2,3-dinor-TXB2) both in pregnancies which went to term (6.1 +/- 0.6 ng/mmol creatinine, LDA group versus 19.3 +/- 3.0 ng/mmol creatinine, PLA group, P < 0.0001) or again ended in miscarriage (4.7 +/- 0.8 ng/mmol creatinine versus 17.3 +/- 4.4 ng/mmol creatinine, P < 0.0001 respectively), but did not affect the excretion of the prostacyclin metabolite (2,3-dinor-6-keto-PGF1alpha). Early pregnancy ultrasound examination revealed a living fetus in 58 women. Of these, seven in the LDA group (23.3%, four with elevated and three with normal ACA concentrations) and five in the PLA group (17.9%, two with elevated and three with normal ACA concentrations; not significant) experienced a miscarriage. All infants were healthy, and the frequency of growth retardation was similar in both groups (13.0%). One woman in the LDA group (4.3%) and three women receiving PLA (13.0%) developed pre-eclampsia (not significant). Therefore, although treatment with LDA caused a desirable biochemical effect, it did not improve pregnancy outcome in RSA women with or without detectable ACA.",An randomized controlled trials involving 54 pregnant women (mean age 32.7 years) with a history of primary recurrent spontaneous abortion of unknown cause (negative standard workup) evaluated 50 mg of aspirin daily (n=27) vs placebo (n=27). The method of blinding was not reported. The live birth rate was identical for the 2 groups (88%).
"What regimens eradicate Heliobacter pylori
To compare the efficacy and tolerability of a 3-day quadruple therapy with a standard 7-day triple therapy in eradicating Helicobacter pylori infection and healing duodenal ulcers. Patients with H. pylori-positive duodenal ulcers were randomized to receive either lansoprazole 30 mg, clarithromycin 500 mg, and metronidazole 400 mg twice daily for 7 days (LCM-7) or lansoprazole 30 mg, clarithromycin 500 mg, metronidazole 400 mg, and bismuth subcitrate 240 mg twice daily for 3 days (LCMB-3). No pre- or post-treatment acid suppression was used. Follow-up endoscopy was performed at week 6. A total of 118 patients were recruited. Sixty patients in the LCM-7 group and 53 patients in the LCMB-3 group returned for endoscopy. Intention-to-treat eradication rates were 87% and 86% (P=0.94) and per protocol eradication rates were 87% and 94% (P=0.29) in the LCM-7 and LCMB-3 groups, respectively. Per protocol and intention-to-treat ulcer healing rates were 98% and 98% in LCM-7 and 100% and 91% in LCMB-3, respectively. There were no significant differences in efficacy in relation to the initial metronidazole and clarithromycin susceptibility. Significant reduction in the duration of side-effects was found in the LCMB-3 group. The 3-day quadruple therapy is highly effective, better tolerated and can be considered as a first-line therapy in duodenal ulcer management.","A randomized clinical trial of 118 patients, blinded to investigators but not patients, showed that quadruple 3-day therapy with lansoprazole + bismuth + clarithromycin + metronidazole was as effective as 7 days of lansoprazole + clarithromycin + metronidazole (87% vs 86%; P=.94), and had significantly shorter duration of side effects (2.6 vs 6.2 days; P<.001). Eradication rates were similar in isolates that were resistant or sensitive to either metronidazole or clarithromycin."
"What is the best approach to goiter for euthyroid patients
The efficacy of treatment with TSH-suppressive doses of L-thyroxine (T4, 2.5 micrograms/kg body weight daily) either alone or combined with carbimazole (CBZ, 40 mg daily) was studied in 78 patients with sporadic non-toxic goitre in a prospective placebo-controlled double-blind randomised clinical trial. Treatment was given for 9 months, with 9 months of follow-up. A response to treatment as measured by ultrasonography was found in 58% of the T4 group, in 35% of the T4/CBZ group, and in 5% of the placebo group. The mean (SEM) decrease of thyroid volume at 9 months in the responders was 25% (2). After discontinuation of treatment, thyroid volume increased in the responders and had returned to base-line values after 9 months of follow-up. In the placebo group mean thyroid volume had increased by 6% (4) at 4 months, 20% (7) at 9 months, and 27% (8) at 18 months. The findings show that untreated sporadic non-toxic goitre continues to increase in size; T4 is effective in the treatment of the disorder; and the addition of CBZ has no therapeutic advantage.","One placebo-controlled trial of thyroid suppression in nontoxic multinodular goiter showed regression of thyroid size with suppressive therapy (58% reduction in size in treatment group vs 5% reduction in control group). However, not all goiters responded to this therapy, and the thyroid size returned to pretreatment size within 9 months of discontinuation of suppressive therapy."
"Do imaging studies aid diagnosis of acute sinusitis
The objective of this study was to assess the discriminative properties of the methods for diagnosing acute maxillary sinusitis (AMS) in unselected patients. The study design was a systematic review of evaluation studies identified by using Medline, by searching reference lists, by hand searches, and by contacting investigators. Evaluation studies were conducted anywhere in the world. Subjects were adults with suspected AMS. Main outcome measures were: sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative likelihood ratios of the primary studies, weighted means of these parameters in each comparison (clinical examination, radiography, and ultrasound compared to a reference standard in diagnosing AMS), and summary ROC curves and their Q* points where sensitivity equals specificity. For the years from 1962 to present, 49 study reports were found; 11 articles on studies that included a total of 1144 patients were eligible. Compared to sinus puncture, radiography was the most accurate method for diagnosing AMS: the Q* point on the summary ROC curve was 0.82 (95% confidence interval, CI, 0.78-0.85). Ultrasound was slightly less accurate than radiography compared to sinus puncture (Q* 0.80, 95% CI 0.76-0.83). Only two articles reported clinical examination compared to sinus puncture and the Q* for them was 0.75 (95% 0.58-0.86). Clinical examination is a rather unreliable method for diagnosing AMS, even in the hands of experienced specialists. Using radiography or ultrasound improves the accuracy of diagnosis. The diagnosis of AMS is rarely studied in primary care settings. Future comparative trials should preferably combine diagnosis and treatment, evaluating the two aspects of clinical management as unit.","Varonen concluded that clinical evaluation has a sensitivity of roughly 0.75, whereas radiographic methodologies have sensitivities>0.80."
"Do angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors prevent nephropathy in type 2 diabetes without proteinuria
Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors attenuate the decline in renal function in diabetic patients with microalbuminuria. However, no data are available on the use of ACE inhibitors to prevent the decrease in renal function in normotensive, normoalbuminuric patients with type 2 diabetes. To evaluate the effect of prolonged ACE inhibition on renal function and albuminuria in patients with type 2 diabetes. Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with 6-year follow-up. Eight outpatient clinics coordinated by a department of medicine in a university hospital. 156 patients in whom type 2 diabetes was diagnosed after 40 years of age who had a baseline mean blood pressure less than 107 mm Hg and albuminuria (albumin excretion < or = 30 mg/24 h). Enalapril, 10 mg/d, or placebo. Degree of albuminuria at 24 hours, creatinine clearance, blood pressure, and hemoglobin A1c values. Enalapril therapy decreased albumin excretion from a mean +/- SD of 11.6 +/- 7 mg/24 h to 9.7 +/- 6 mg/24 h at 2 years. This was followed by a gradual increase to 15.8 +/- 8 mg/24 h at 6 years. In the placebo group, albumin excretion increased from 10.8 +/- 8 mg/24 h to 26.5 +/- 10 mg/24 h at 6 years (P = 0.001 for enalapril compared with placebo). Transition to microalbuminuria occurred in 15 of 79 (19%) placebo recipients and 5 of 77 (6.5%) enalapril recipients. Enalapril treatment resulted in an absolute risk reduction of 12.5% (95% CI, 2% to 23%; P = 0.042) for development of microalbuminuria. After 6 years, creatinine clearance decreased from 1.78 +/- 0.13 mL/s to 1.63 +/- 0.12 mL/s (mean decrease, 0.025 mL/s per year) in enalapril recipients and from 1.81 +/- 0.15 mL/s to 1.57 +/- 0.17 mL/s (mean decrease, 0.04 mL/s per year) in placebo recipients (P = 0.040). Hemoglobin A1c values decreased modestly in both groups. Mean blood pressure remained normal (< 107 mm Hg) in all patients. Enalapril attenuated the decline in renal function and reduced the extent of albuminuria in normotensive, normoalbuminuric patients with type 2 diabetes. Further research is needed to determine whether this treatment forestalls the development of overt nephropathy.","A trial compared enalapril (Vasotec) 10 mg/d with placebo in 194 normotensive patients (aged 40-60) with type 2 diabetes and without microalbuminuria, defined as albumin excretion rate >30 mg/24 hr. Over the 6-year course of the study, the albumin excretion rate in the placebo group rose from 10.8 mg/24 hr to 26.5 mg/24 hr. The albumin excretion rate of the treatment group dropped from 11.6 mg/24 hr initially to 9.7 mg/24 hr at 2 years, then rose to 15.8 mg/24 hr at 6 years. Enalapril significantly slowed the rise in albumin excretion rate (RRR=0.4; P=.001). Nineteen percent of the placebo group developed microalbuminuria, compared with 6.5% of those taking enalapril (absolute risk reduction[ARR]=12.5%; number needed to treat=8; P=.042). While this study described a modest and statistically significant renal protective effect of enalapril, it did not use an intention-to-treat analysis."

It has been reported that gamma-linolenic acid contained in borage oil is effective against atopic dermatitis. The clinical effects of undershirts coated with borage oil rich in gamma-linolenic acid on atopic dermatitis were evaluated. Thirty-two children, aged 1-10 years, were involved in the clinical control study. Sixteen had worn undershirts coated with borage oil everyday for 2 weeks, and 16 had worn non-coated undershirts as a placebo. Their symptoms were assessed on a 4-point scale. Those children who had worn undershirts coated with borage oil for 2 weeks showed improvements in their erythema and itch, which were statistically significant. Transepidermal water loss from the back was decreased. In the placebo group, there were no statistically significant differences. The undershirts coated with borage oil were found to be statistically effective, and had no side-effects on children with mild atopic dermatitis.","A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 32 children that assessed the effects of undershirts coated with borage oil compared with noncoated undershirts found statistically significant improvements in both itching and erythema."
"Can nonantidepressants help treat depression
The delayed onset of therapeutic response and the high number of nonresponders to antidepressants remain major clinical problems in depressive disorders. Among the strategies to overcome both dilemmas, the additional treatment with lithium has been suggested as a viable method. The authors determined in 2 separate meta-analyses the efficacy of lithium in accelerating and in augmenting clinical response in patients with depression. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA SOURCES: Two meta-analyses of randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials including subjects with unipolar or bipolar disorder, depressive phase, assessed the concomitant administration of lithium and antidepressant to accelerate or augment clinical response in the acute treatment phase of depression. Data were obtained from searching the following databases: MEDLINE (1966 to July 2006), EMBASE (1989 to July 2006), and The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2006, Issue 3). For the accelerating meta-analysis, subject headings including depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, antidepressive agents, and lithium and text words such as depress*, lithium, and antidepress* were used. For the augmentation meta-analysis, subject headings included depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, anti-depressive agents, lithium, drug therapy, and combination, and text words included augment*, refract*, and resistant. Outcomes investigated included response rates and depression scale rates. Five acceleration studies (231 participants) adding lithium to tricyclics and tetracyclics and 10 augmentation studies (269 participants) adding lithium to various antidepressants including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors were incorporated. In the acceleration meta-analysis, a statistical trend in favor of lithium was found (standardized mean difference of -0.43, 95% CI = -0.93 to 0.07). In the augmentation meta-analysis, lithium was significantly more effective than placebo (odds ratio = 3.11, 95% CI = 1.80 to 5.37). There is firm evidence for lithium as an effective augmentation strategy but only modest evidence for lithium to accelerate response to antidepressants in patients with depressive disorders.","A meta-analysis of 10 augmentation studies reported that adding lithium to various antidepressant agents increased the chances of clinical response 3-fold relative to placebo (odds ratio [OR]=3.11; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.80-5.37), yielding a number needed to treat (NNT) of 5. The mean response rate was 41.2% in the lithium group and 14.4% in the placebo group (P<.001). The meta-analysis included only RCTs that enrolled subjects with unipolar or bipolar disorder (depressive phase) who were treated with any antidepressant plus lithium in any dose compared with placebo."
"What is the best initial treatment of Parkinson's disease
The value of an early initial coadministration of levodopa (L-dopa) and lisuride in Parkinson's disease was the main goal of the present study. Eighty-two patients with recently diagnosed idiopathic Parkinson's disease were randomized into two groups for treatment with L-dopa alone or L-dopa + lisuride. The trial was double-blinded for the first year and open for the following 4 years. Selegiline (10 mg/day b.i.d.) was added in both groups at the end of the first year. Outcome measures were evolution of L-dopa dosage and Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale scores and subscores, and incidence of motor complications. The dropout rate was higher in the L-dopa group (63.4%) than in the combination group. Motor improvement was better (p < 0.01) in the L-dopa + lisuride group. Expected motor complications were rare, moderate and equivalent in the two groups despite a difference in L-dopa dosage (446.7 vs. 387.5 mg/day). Long-term follow-up demonstrated the L-dopa-sparing effect of lisuride (average 1 mg/day), the beneficial effect of early combination therapy on motor status and the paucity of motor complications in both groups.",A study comparing lisuride with or without levodopa vs levodopa alone found no difference in motor complications at 5 years.
"Do preparticipation clinical exams reduce morbidity and mortality for athletes
To develop clinical, demographic, and pathological profiles of young competitive athletes who died suddenly. Systematic evaluation of clinical information and circumstances associated with sudden deaths; interviews with family members, witnesses, and coaches; and analyses of postmortem anatomic, microscopic, and toxicologic data. A total of 158 sudden deaths that occurred in trained athletes throughout the United States from 1985 through 1995 were analyzed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Characteristics and probable cause of death. Of 158 sudden deaths among athletes, 24 (15%) were explained by noncardiovascular causes. Among the 134 athletes who had cardiovascular causes of sudden death, the median age was 17 years (range, 12-40 years), 120 (90%) were male, 70 (52%) were white, and 59 (44%) were black. The most common competitive sports involved were basketball (47 cases) and football (45 cases), together accounting for 68% of sudden deaths. A total of 121 athletes (90%) collapsed during or immediately after a training session (78 cases) or a formal athletic contest (43 cases), with 80 deaths (63%) occurring between 3 PM and 9 PM. The most common structural cardiovascular diseases identified at autopsy as the primary cause of death were hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (48 athletes [36%]), which was disproportionately prevalent in black athletes compared with white athletes (48% vs 26% of deaths; P = .01), and malformations involving anomalous coronary artery origin (17 athletes [13%]). Of 115 athletes who had a standard preparticipation medical evaluation, only 4 (3%) were suspected of having cardiovascular disease, and the cardiovascular abnormality responsible for sudden death was correctly identified in only 1 athlete (0.9%). Sudden death in young competitive athletes usually is precipitated by physical activity and may be due to a heterogeneous spectrum of cardiovascular disease, most commonly hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Preparticipation screening appeared to be of limited value in identification of underlying cardiovascular abnormalities.","A case series reviewed 158 sudden deaths that occurred in trained athletes in the US from 1985 to 1995. The athletes were identified from news accounts, the National Center for Catastrophic Sports Injury Registry, and informal communications and reports. The authors interviewed families, witnesses, and coaches, and they analyzed postmortem information. Of the 115 athletes who had a standard preparticipation medical evaluation, only 4 (3%) were suspected of having cardiovascular disease. The cardiovascular abnormality responsible for sudden death was prospectively identified in only 1 athlete."
"Are there any known health risks to early introduction of solids to an infant's diet
To assess the evidence that early solid feeding (before age 4 months) increases the risk of allergic disease. MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, and the Drugs and Pharmacology section of EMBASE with key words ""infant,"" ""food,"" and ""allergy."" We found 2719 article citations and reviewed references of relevant articles. We critically evaluated the methods and results of articles that met inclusion criteria. We identified 13 studies that met inclusion criteria. There was only 1 controlled trial. Allergic disease. Five studies found a positive association between early solid feeding and eczema, with a persistence of the association for 10 years in 1 study. Four studies found no association. One study found an association between early solid feeding and pollen allergy. We found no strong evidence to support the association between early solid feeding and the development of persistent asthma, persistent food allergy, allergic rhinitis, or animal dander allergy. Systematic review of available evidence suggests that early solid feeding may increase the risk of eczema. However, there are little data supporting an association between early solid feeding and other allergic conditions. Since many studies had problematic methods, additional controlled trials are needed to help guide physicians as they advise parents about the allergic risks of early introduction of solids.","A 2006 meta-analysis of 13 studies examining the risk of atopic diseases associated with early introduction of solids concluded that ""there is insufficient evidence to suggest that, on its own, the early introduction of solids to infants is associated with an increased risk of asthma, food allergy, allergic rhinitis, or animal allergies."" The meta-analysis showed some evidence of an association between early solid introduction and eczema, the strongest being a 10-year New Zealand cohort study (N=1265)."
"What is the best workup for hypocalcemia
Postoperative hypocalcemia is a common and most often transient event after extensive thyroid surgery. It may reveal iatrogenic injury to the parathyroid glands and permanent hypoparathyroidism. We prospectively evaluated the incidence of hypocalcemia and permanent hypoparathyroidism following total or subtotal thyroidectomy in 1071 consecutive patients operated during 1990-1991. We then determined in a cross-sectional study which early clinical and biochemical characteristics of patients experiencing postoperative hypocalcemia correlated with the long-term outcome. Postoperative calcemia under 2 mmol/l was observed in 58 patients (5. 4%). In 40 patients hypocalcemia was considered severe (confirmed for more than 2 days, symptomatic or both). At 1 year after surgery five patients (0.5%) had persistent hypocalcemia. We found that patients carried a high risk for permanent hypoparathyroidism if fewer than three parathyroid glands were preserved in situ during surgery or the early serum parathyroid hormone level was </= 12 pg/ml, the delayed serum calcium levels </= 8 mg/dl, or the delayed serum phosphorus level >/= 4 mg/dl under oral calcium therapy. When one or more of these criteria are present, long-term follow-up should be enforced to check for chronic hypocalcemia and to avoid its severe complications by appropriate supplement therapy.","The usual cause of critically low serum calcium (<7 mg/dL ""corrected"" or <3.2 mg/dL ionized) is parathyroidectomy or acute renal failure. Hypocalcemia resulting from partial parathyroidectomy or thyroidectomy (with inadvertent parathyroidectomy) occurs in approximately 5% of these surgeries; 99.5% of cases resolve completely within a year."
"Does tamoxifen prevent breast cancer
The finding of a decrease in contralateral breast cancer incidence following tamoxifen administration for adjuvant therapy led to the concept that the drug might play a role in breast cancer prevention. To test this hypothesis, the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project initiated the Breast Cancer Prevention Trial (P-1) in 1992. Women (N=13388) at increased risk for breast cancer because they 1) were 60 years of age or older, 2) were 35-59 years of age with a 5-year predicted risk for breast cancer of at least 1.66%, or 3) had a history of lobular carcinoma in situ were randomly assigned to receive placebo (n=6707) or 20 mg/day tamoxifen (n=6681) for 5 years. Gail's algorithm, based on a multivariate logistic regression model using combinations of risk factors, was used to estimate the probability (risk) of occurrence of breast cancer over time. Tamoxifen reduced the risk of invasive breast cancer by 49% (two-sided P<.00001), with cumulative incidence through 69 months of follow-up of 43.4 versus 22.0 per 1000 women in the placebo and tamoxifen groups, respectively. The decreased risk occurred in women aged 49 years or younger (44%), 50-59 years (51%), and 60 years or older (55%); risk was also reduced in women with a history of lobular carcinoma in situ (56%) or atypical hyperplasia (86%) and in those with any category of predicted 5-year risk. Tamoxifen reduced the risk of noninvasive breast cancer by 50% (two-sided P<.002). Tamoxifen reduced the occurrence of estrogen receptor-positive tumors by 69%, but no difference in the occurrence of estrogen receptor-negative tumors was seen. Tamoxifen administration did not alter the average annual rate of ischemic heart disease; however, a reduction in hip, radius (Colles'), and spine fractures was observed. The rate of endometrial cancer was increased in the tamoxifen group (risk ratio = 2.53; 95% confidence interval = 1.35-4.97); this increased risk occurred predominantly in women aged 50 years or older. All endometrial cancers in the tamoxifen group were stage I (localized disease); no endometrial cancer deaths have occurred in this group. No liver cancers or increase in colon, rectal, ovarian, or other tumors was observed in the tamoxifen group. The rates of stroke, pulmonary embolism, and deep-vein thrombosis were elevated in the tamoxifen group; these events occurred more frequently in women aged 50 years or older. Tamoxifen decreases the incidence of invasive and noninvasive breast cancer. Despite side effects resulting from administration of tamoxifen, its use as a breast cancer preventive agent is appropriate in many women at increased risk for the disease.",An randomized controlled trials reported a 49% (P <.001) reduction in incidence of invasive breast cancer and 50% in noninvasive breast cancer (P <.002) among women with a 5-year risk of breast cancer ž 1.66% based on the Gail Risk Index. Estrogen receptor (ER)-negative breast cancers were unaffected.
"Are any alternative therapies effective in treating asthma
According to Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) acupuncture is a suitable treatment for complex chronic diseases such as bronchial asthma. In a randomized, controlled study we investigated immunologic effects of Chinese acupuncture on patients with allergic asthma. The effects of acupuncture treatment given according to the principles of TCM (TCM group, n = 20) were compared with those of acupuncture treatment using points not specific for asthma (control group, n = 18). All patients were treated 12 times for 30 minutes over a time period of 4 weeks. Patients' general well-being and several peripheral blood parameters (eosinophils, lymphocyte subpopulations, cytokines, in vitro lymphocyte proliferation) were determined before and after acupuncture treatment. In the TCM group, significantly more patients indicated an improvement in general well-being (79% in the TCM group versus 47% in the control group; p = 0.049) after acupuncture treatment. The following changes were found in the TCM group: within the lymphocyte subpopulations the CD3+ cells (p = 0.005) and CD4+ cells (p = 0.014) increased significantly. There were also significant changes in cytokine concentrations: interleukin (IL)-6 (p = 0.026) and IL-10 (p = 0.001) decreased whereas IL-8 (p = 0.050) rose significantly. Additionally, the in vitro lymphocyte proliferation rate increased significantly (p = 0.035) while the number of eosinophils decreased from 4.4% to 3.3% after acupuncture (p > 0.05). The control group, however, showed no significant changes apart from an increase in the CD4+ cells (p = 0.012). The results imply that asthma patients benefit from acupuncture treatment given in addition to conventional therapy. Furthermore, acupuncture performed in accordance with the principles of TCM showed significant immune-modulating effects.","In 1 RCT, improvement in general well-being was reported by 79% of 38 patients receiving acupuncture compared with 47% of 18 patients in the control group."
"What is the most effective way for relieving constipation in children aged >1 year
To compare short- and long-term effectiveness of three additive treatment protocols in children experiencing chronic encopresis. Children, 6 to 15 years of age, who experienced at least weekly fecal soiling for 6 months or longer were eligible for the study. Children were randomly assigned to a group that received intensive medical therapy (IMT), a group that received intensive medical therapy plus a behavior management program called enhanced toilet training (ETT), or a group that received intensive medical therapy with enhanced toilet training and external anal sphincter electromyographic biofeedback (BF). Data concerning toileting habits were collected for 14 consecutive days before an initial visit, and at 3, 6, and 12 months after initiation of therapy. All data were collected using a computerized voice-mail system that telephoned the families each day. At 12 months, children were classified as significantly improved (reduction in soiling, P < 0.001) or cured (<one fecal accident in 2 weeks). Eighty-seven children participated in the study, 72 boys and 15 girls. Mean age at enrollment was 8.6 +/- 2.0 years, and mean duration of symptoms was 58.2 +/- 38.5 months. At 12 months, the cure rates for the IMM, ETT, and BF groups were 36, 48, and 39, respectively (not significant). The improvement rates for these three groups were 45, 78, and 54, respectively (P < 0.05). These results were very stable over time (r > 0.90, P < 0.001 in each case). Response to treatment during the first 2 weeks of therapy was highly predictive of outcome at 3, 6, and 12 months (P < 0.0001). Children in the ETT group used less laxative medication (P < 0.04) and required fewer treatment contacts (P = 0.08) than children in the IMM group. All three treatments resulted in significant increases in daily bowel movements passed in the toilet and self-initiated toileting, and resulted in decreases in average daily soiling at 3, 6, and 12 months (P < 0.05). Enhanced toilet training is somewhat more effective in treating childhood encopresis than either intensive medical therapy or anal sphincter biofeedback therapy. Although similar total cure rates at 1 year can be expected with these three forms of therapy, enhanced toilet training results in statistically significant decreases in the daily frequency of soiling for the greatest number of children.","A randomized controlled trial of 87 children with fecal soiling compared the effect of enhanced toilet training (including behavioral therapy) with aggressive medical management that included disimpaction, enemas, and regular laxative therapy. After 12 months, the enhanced toilet training with behavioral therapy was more effective in reducing daily frequency of soiling (78% of the children had significantly decreased average daily frequency of soiling compared with 41% in the aggressive medical management group; P<.0001; absolute risk reduction=0.37; number needed to treat for 1 year=2.7)."
"What is the best treatment for hypertension in African Americans
Hypertension is a leading cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in the United States, with no known treatment to prevent progressive declines leading to ESRD. To compare the effects of 2 levels of blood pressure (BP) control and 3 antihypertensive drug classes on glomerular filtration rate (GFR) decline in hypertension. Randomized 3 x 2 factorial trial with enrollment from February 1995 to September 1998. A total of 1094 African Americans aged 18 to 70 years with hypertensive renal disease (GFR, 20-65 mL/min per 1.73 m(2)) were recruited from 21 clinical centers throughout the United States and followed up for 3 to 6.4 years. Participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 mean arterial pressure goals, 102 to 107 mm Hg (usual; n = 554) or 92 mm Hg or less (lower; n = 540), and to initial treatment with either a beta-blocker (metoprolol 50-200 mg/d; n = 441), an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ramipril 2.5-10 mg/d; n = 436) or a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, (amlodipine 5-10 mg/d; n = 217). Open-label agents were added to achieve the assigned BP goals. Rate of change in GFR (GFR slope); clinical composite outcome of reduction in GFR by 50% or more (or > or =25 mL/min per 1.73 m2) from baseline, ESRD, or death. Three primary treatment comparisons were specified: lower vs usual BP goal; ramipril vs metoprolol; and amlodipine vs metoprolol. Achieved BP averaged (SD) 128/78 (12/8) mm Hg in the lower BP group and 141/85 (12/7) mm Hg in the usual BP group. The mean (SE) GFR slope from baseline through 4 years did not differ significantly between the lower BP group (-2.21 [0.17] mL/min per 1.73 m2 per year) and the usual BP group (-1.95 [0.17] mL/min per 1.73 m2 per year; P =.24), and the lower BP goal did not significantly reduce the rate of the clinical composite outcome (risk reduction for lower BP group = 2%; 95% confidence interval [CI], -22% to 21%; P =.85). None of the drug group comparisons showed consistent significant differences in the GFR slope. However, compared with the metoprolol and amlodipine groups, the ramipril group manifested risk reductions in the clinical composite outcome of 22% (95% CI, 1%-38%; P =.04) and 38% (95% CI, 14%-56%; P =.004), respectively. There was no significant difference in the clinical composite outcome between the amlodipine and metoprolol groups. No additional benefit of slowing progression of hypertensive nephrosclerosis was observed with the lower BP goal. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors appear to be more effective than beta-blockers or dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers in slowing GFR decline.",Metoprolol appeared to have intermediate outcomes.
"How should we manage a patient with a positive PPD and prior BCG vaccination
Because tuberculosis among the foreign-born is of increasing importance in North America, it has recently been recommended that newly arriving immigrants be tuberculin tested and preventive therapy given to all those with significant reactions. The factors affecting the prevalence of tuberculin reactions were assessed in a community-based tuberculin survey among foreign-born schoolchildren and young adults. Of 1,198 foreign-born who were tuberculin tested, 32.4% had significant tuberculin reactions. False-positive tuberculin reactions due to sensitivity to purified protein derivative (PPD)-B (for Mycobacterium avium) were uncommon and those due to BCG vaccination of importance only among immigrants from countries with low tuberculosis rates. Tuberculin reactions of 10+ mm were associated with tuberculosis rates in the country of origin (p less than or equal to 0.001), age when immigrated (p less than or equal to 0.001), bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination (p less than or equal to 0.01), and residence in poorer neighborhoods in Montreal (p less than or equal to 0.001), but not with number of years resident in Canada. The booster phenomenon, seen in 16% of those undergoing two-step testing, was most strongly associated with prior BCG vaccination (p less than or equal to 0.001) and also with tuberculosis rates in the country of origin (p less than or equal to 0.08), age of immigration (p less than or equal to 0.01), and number of years resident in Canada (p less than or equal to 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","In a Quebec cohort of 1198 foreign-born children and young adults, prior BCG vaccination could account for 50% of PPDs with induration of 5 to 9 mm, but only 4% of reactions 10 mm or greater. This study also showed that patients from countries with a high or moderate incidence of tuberculosis were more likely to have reactive PPDs than those from countries of low incidence, suggesting that exposure to tuberculosis accounts for some of the positive PPDs."
"Is guaifenesin safe during pregnancy
We investigated if selected maternal illnesses or medications used during the periconceptional period increased risk of having neural tube defect (NTD)-affected pregnancies. We used a population-based case-control study of fetuses and liveborn infants with NTDs among 1989-1991 California births. In-person interviews were conducted with mothers of 538 (88% of eligible) NTD cases and 539 (88%) nonmalformed controls, usually within 5 months of delivery. A maternal fever or febrile illness episode in the first trimester was associated with an increased risk for having a NTD-affected pregnancy, odds ratio (OR) = 1.91 (95% confidence interval, 1.35-2.72) for fever and OR = 2.02 (1.20-3.43) for febrile illness. Risk estimates were not substantially altered after adjustment for maternal age, race/ethnicity, education, vitamin use, and body mass index. Other reported illnesses were generally not associated with risks of 1.5 or greater, or were too infrequent to adequately estimate risk. An OR of 1.5 or greater was observed for maternal use of guaifenesin, OR = 2.04 (0.79-5.28), and an OR of 0.5 or less was observed for maternal use of calcium-containing medicines, OR = 0.38 (0.14-1.03). Our findings are consistent with previous reports that suggested elevated NTD risks from maternal fever. We could not discriminate, however, whether the increased risks observed for maternal fever were indicative of a causal relation or due to reporting bias. Our findings suggest that many of the illnesses common to reproductive-aged women and the medications commonly used to treat them during pregnancy, except, perhaps, for those illnesses that are febrile-related, do not appear to substantially contribute to the occurrence of NTDs in the population.","Guaifenesin use in pregnancy may also be associated with neural tube defects. In a case-control study, researchers identified 538 fetuses and live-born infants with neural tube defects between 1989 and 1991. Twelve patients with neural tube defects were exposed to guaifenesin during gestation; 6 in the control group reported exposure. The authors reported a trend towards increased risk of neural tube defects in offspring of guaifenesin-exposed mothers (odds ratio=2.04; 95% CI, 0.79-5.28). However, since the results were not statistically significant, the authors concluded that guaifenesin had not contributed to the occurrence of neural tube defects."
"What are the treatment options for SSRI-related sexual dysfunction
The authors compared low-dose sustained-release bupropion with placebo for sexual dysfunction induced by selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Thirty adults who had received SSRIs for at least 6 weeks, who were euthymic, and who had sexual dysfunction as determined by a total score greater than 19 out of a possible 30 on the Arizona Sexual Experience Scale were randomly assigned to receive either 150 mg/day of sustained-release bupropion or placebo at 6:00 p.m. for 3 weeks. There were no significant differences between the sustained-release bupropion and placebo groups as measured by change in Arizona Sexual Experiences Scale or Hamilton Depression Rating Scale scores or side effects. Future studies should compare higher doses of bupropion for treating sexual dysfunction and should include a greater number of subjects.","In a trial, adding bupropion or placebo showed equal improvement in sexual function."
"Does psychiatric treatment help patients with intractable chronic pain
Behavioural treatment, commonly used in the treatment of chronic low-back pain (CLBP), is primarily focused at reducing disability through the modification of environmental contingencies and cognitive processes. In general, three behavioural treatment approaches are distinguished: operant, cognitive and respondent. To determine if behavioural therapy is more effective than reference treatments for CLBP, and which type of behavioural treatment is most effective. We searched the CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycLIT databases up to October 2003. References of identified randomised trials and relevant systematic reviews were screened. Only randomised trials on behavioural treatment for non-specific CLBP were included. Two reviewers independently assessed the methodological quality and extracted the data. The magnitude of effect was assessed by computing a pooled effect size for post-treatment and long-term results for each comparison, for each domain (i.e., behavioural outcomes, overall improvement, back pain specific and generic functional status, return to work, and pain intensity) using the random effects model. Seven studies (33%) were considered high quality. Comparing behavioural treatment to waiting list control (WLC) revealed strong evidence (4 trials, 134 people) in favour of a combined respondent-cognitive therapy for a medium positive effect on pain, and moderate evidence (2 trials, 39 people) in favour of progressive relaxation for a large positive effect on pain and behavioural outcomes (short-term only). When comparing operant treatment to WLC no significant differences could be detected on general functional status (strong evidence: 2 trials, 87 people) or on behavioural outcomes (moderate evidence; 3 trials, 153 people) (short-term only). There is limited evidence (1 trial, 98 people) that a graded activity program in an industrial setting is more effective than usual care for early return to work and reduced long-term sick leave. There is limited evidence (1 trail, 39 people) that there are no differences between behavioural treatment and exercises. Finally, there is moderate evidence (6 trials, 210 people) that there are no significant differences in short-term and long-term effectiveness when behavioural components are added to usual treatment programs for CLBP (i.e. physiotherapy, back education) on pain, generic functional status and behavioural outcomes. Combined respondent-cognitive therapy and progressive relaxation therapy are more effective than WLC on short-term pain relief. However, it is unknown whether these results sustain in the long term. No significant differences could be detected between behavioural treatment and exercise therapy. Whether clinicians should refer patients with CLBP to behavioural treatment programs or to active conservative treatment cannot be concluded from this review.","A review found that cognitive and progressive relaxation therapy had a moderate effect on short-term pain control vs waiting-list controls for chronic back pain. However, only a third of the studies were of ""high quality,"" and the total number of patients in the relaxation analysis was 39."
"What are effective treatments for oppositional and defiant behaviors in preadolescents
Behavior problems in children are an important social, educational, and health issue. The prevalence of these problems, their stability over time, their poor prognosis, and their costs to both individuals and the society, all point to the need for primary prevention and early effective interventions. A systematic review examined the effectiveness of group parent education programs that aimed to improve behavior problems in 3- to 10-year-old children. The phrase ""parent education program"" is used here to refer to group-based programs with a standardized format aimed at enhancing parenting skills. The term ""behavior problems"" is used to refer to children exhibiting externalizing problems such as temper tantrums, aggression, and noncompliance. It does not include children diagnosed as having attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. This review focused explicitly on measures of child behavioral outcomes, which are only small, albeit important, outcomes of parent education programs. Reviews focusing on other clinically relevant outcomes are also needed, including parental well-being and attitudes towards parenting. Other reviews are also needed to collate evidence concerning the effectiveness of parent education programs with other age-groups, i.e., preschoolers and adolescents, and in improving other aspects of child well-being. The review included published studies only and as such may have been influenced by a ""publication bias."" Inclusion criteria comprised the use of a waiting list, a no-treatment or placebo control group, and at least one standardized measure assessing the child's behavior. Only studies published after 1970 that included at least one ""group-based"" parent education program were included. A total of 255 primary studies were identified, but only 16 of these and 2 follow-up studies met all of the specified inclusion criteria. Critical appraisal of these 16 studies revealed considerable heterogeneity in the interventions, the populations studied, and the outcome measures used. Nevertheless, these studies suggest that structured parent education programs can be effective in producing positive change in both parental perceptions and objective measures of children's behavior and that these changes are maintained over time. Because of the small number of controlled studies and their methodological variations, caution should be exercised before these findings are generalized broadly.","A rigorous well-done systematic review looked at 16 randomized controlled trials that examined the effectiveness of training programs for children between the ages of 3 and 10 years who had externalizing problems, including temper tantrums, aggression, and noncompliance. All studies included in the review compared a group-based parent training program with a no-treatment wait-list control group and assessed outcomes using a standardized measure of behavior. In studies where sufficient data were provided, effect sizes ranged from 0.6 to 2.9. This indicates that, on a standardized child behavioral measure, parental report of children's externalizing problems decreased by 0.6 to 2.9 standard deviations from pre- to posttreatment (an effect size of >0.8 is considered large). In the 2 studies that included independent observations of child behavior, the benefits reported by parents were confirmed by these observations."
"How should you manage a depressed patient unresponsive to an SSRI
Although clinicians frequently add a second medication to an initial, ineffective antidepressant drug, no randomized controlled trial has compared the efficacy of this approach. We randomly assigned 565 adult outpatients who had nonpsychotic major depressive disorder without remission despite a mean of 11.9 weeks of citalopram therapy (mean final dose, 55 mg per day) to receive sustained-release bupropion (at a dose of up to 400 mg per day) as augmentation and 286 to receive buspirone (at a dose of up to 60 mg per day) as augmentation. The primary outcome of remission of symptoms was defined as a score of 7 or less on the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD-17) at the end of this study; scores were obtained over the telephone by raters blinded to treatment assignment. The 16-item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology--Self-Report (QIDS-SR-16) was used to determine the secondary outcomes of remission (defined as a score of less than 6 at the end of this study) and response (a reduction in baseline scores of 50 percent or more). The sustained-release bupropion group and the buspirone group had similar rates of HRSD-17 remission (29.7 percent and 30.1 percent, respectively), QIDS-SR-16 remission (39.0 percent and 32.9 percent), and QIDS-SR-16 response (31.8 percent and 26.9 percent). Sustained-release bupropion, however, was associated with a greater reduction (from baseline to the end of this study) in QIDS-SR-16 scores than was buspirone (25.3 percent vs. 17.1 percent, P<0.04), a lower QIDS-SR-16 score at the end of this study (8.0 vs. 9.1, P<0.02), and a lower dropout rate due to intolerance (12.5 percent vs. 20.6 percent, P<0.009). Augmentation of citalopram with either sustained-release bupropion or buspirone appears to be useful in actual clinical settings. Augmentation with sustained-release bupropion does have certain advantages, including a greater reduction in the number and severity of symptoms and fewer side effects and adverse events. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00021528.).",An arm of the sequenced treatment alternatives to relieve depression trial added either sustained-release bupropion or buspirone (Buspar) to the failed citalopram therapy. Thirty percent of patients with depression unresponsive to citalopram had remission when bupropion-SR or buspirone was added. The sequenced treatment alternatives to relieve depression reports do not compare the 2 strategies of switching or combining drugs directly.
"What is the best approach to the evaluation and treatment of chronic cough
To evaluate a stepwise approach to chronic cough that emphasized initial treatment of all patients with an antihistamine-decongestant for postnasal drip and to determine the value of routine bronchoprovocation challenge in the evaluation of chronic cough. Prospective trial using an algorithm for chronic cough in immunocompetent nonsmoking out-patients. University-based pulmonary practice. Forty-five patients met the inclusion criteria. The mean duration of cough was 140 weeks (range, 3 to 2080 weeks), and the mean severity of cough as assessed by patients on a four-point scale was ""severe."" Marked improvement and resolution (mean, 3.1 and 7.1 weeks, respectively), with resolution in 96% of patients. Antihistamine-decongestant therapy was beneficial in 39 of 45 patients and was the only therapy needed for 16 patients. Bronchoprovocation challenge had a negative predictive value of 100% and a positive predictive value of 74% for cough caused by asthma. No significant relationship was found between the time to cough resolution and duration or severity of cough. Eighteen percent of patients experienced a recurrence of cough at a follow-up interval of 3 months. A sequential approach to chronic cough that emphasizes initial treatment with an antihistamine-decongestant is effective. Bronchoprovocation challenge is useful in evaluating patients with chronic cough but can be delayed until the initial response to antihistamine-decongestant therapy has been assessed. The 18% incidence of recurrence highlights the fact that cough often is the manifestation of a chronic or recurring process that requires chronic or episodic therapy.","One study used a protocol that delayed the chest x-ray for 2 weeks, until after empiric treatment for postnasal drip syndrome and evaluation for asthma. These authors eliminated half of the x-rays and achieved results equivalent to previous studies."
"What interventions reduce the risk of contrast nephropathy for high-risk patients
Contrast-induced nephropathy remains a common complication of radiographic procedures. Pretreatment with sodium bicarbonate is more protective than sodium chloride in animal models of acute ischemic renal failure. Acute renal failure from both ischemia and contrast are postulated to occur from free-radical injury. However, no studies in humans or animals have evaluated the efficacy of sodium bicarbonate for prophylaxis against contrast-induced nephropathy. To examine the efficacy of sodium bicarbonate compared with sodium chloride for preventive hydration before and after radiographic contrast. A prospective, single-center, randomized trial conducted from September 16, 2002, to June 17, 2003, of 119 patients with stable serum creatinine levels of at least 1.1 mg/dL (> or =97.2 micromol/L) who were randomized to receive a 154-mEq/L infusion of either sodium chloride (n = 59) or sodium bicarbonate (n = 60) before and after iopamidol administration (370 mg iodine/mL). Serum creatinine levels were measured at baseline and 1 and 2 days after contrast. Patients received 154 mEq/L of either sodium chloride or sodium bicarbonate, as a bolus of 3 mL/kg per hour for 1 hour before iopamidol contrast, followed by an infusion of 1 mL/kg per hour for 6 hours after the procedure. Contrast-induced nephropathy, defined as an increase of 25% or more in serum creatinine within 2 days of contrast. There were no significant group differences in age, sex, incidence of diabetes mellitus, ethnicity, or contrast volume. Baseline serum creatinine was slightly higher but not statistically different in patients receiving sodium bicarbonate treatment (mean [SD], 1.71 [0.42] mg/dL [151.2 [37.1] micromol/L] for sodium chloride and 1.89 [0.69] mg/dL [167.1 [61.0] micromol/L] for sodium bicarbonate; P =.09). The primary end point of contrast-induced nephropathy occurred in 8 patients (13.6%) infused with sodium chloride but in only 1 (1.7%) of those receiving sodium bicarbonate (mean difference, 11.9%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.6%-21.2%; P =.02). A follow-up registry of 191 consecutive patients receiving prophylactic sodium bicarbonate and meeting the same inclusion criteria as the study resulted in 3 cases of contrast-induced nephropathy (1.6%; 95% CI, 0%-3.4%). Hydration with sodium bicarbonate before contrast exposure is more effective than hydration with sodium chloride for prophylaxis of contrast-induced renal failure.",An randomized controlled trials showed decreased risk of contrast nephropathy for patients pretreated with intravenous fluids containing sodium bicarbonate compared with those pretreated with a sodium chloride solution (number needed to treat [NNT]=8.4).
"What is the best way to identify patients with white-coat hypertension
To delineate more precisely an operational threshold for making clinical decisions based on ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) measurement by studying the ABP in subjects who were diagnosed as either normotensive or hypertensive by conventional blood pressure (CBP) measurement. Twenty-four research groups recruited 7069 subjects. Of these, 4577 were normotensive (CBP < or = 140/90 mmHg), 719 were borderline hypertensive (systolic CBP 141-159 mmHg or diastolic CBP 91-94 mmHg) and 1773 were definitely hypertensive. Of the subjects in the last of these categories, 1324 had systolic hypertension (systolic CBP > or = 160 mmHg) and 1310 had diastolic hypertension (diastolic CBP > or = 95 mmHg). Hypertension had been diagnosed from the mean of two to nine (median two) CBP measurements obtained at one to three (median two) visits. The 95th centiles of the 24-h ABP distributions in the normotensive subjects were (systolic and diastolic, respectively) 133 and 82 mmHg. Of the subjects with systolic hypertension, 24% had 24-h systolic ABP < 133 mmHg. Similarly, 30% of those with diastolic hypertension had 24-h diastolic ABP < 82 mmHg. The probability that hypertensive subjects had 24-h ABP below these thresholds tended to increase with age and was two- to fourfold greater if the CBP of the subject had been measured at only one visit and if fewer than three CBP measurements had been averaged for establishing the diagnosis of hypertension. By contrast, for each 10-mmHg increment in systolic CBP, this probability decreased by 54% for 24-h systolic ABP and by 26% for 24-h diastolic ABP, and for each 5-mmHg increment in diastolic CBP it decreased by 6 and 9%, respectively. The ABP distributions of the normotensive subjects included in the present international database were not materially different from those in previous reports in the literature. One-fifth to more than one-third of hypertensive subjects had an ABP which was below the 95th centile of the ABP of normotensive subjects, but this proportion decreased if the hypertensive subjects had shown a higher CBP upon repeated measurement. The prognostic implications of elevated CBP in the presence of normal ABP remain to be determined.","A large international database of 2492 subjects found that women, older subjects, and those with lower and fewer office systolic blood pressure measurements were more likely to have white-coat hypertension."
"For those intolerant to angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors and ARBs, what is the best therapy for reducing the risk of diabetic nephropathy
It is unknown whether either the angiotensin-II-receptor blocker irbesartan or the calcium-channel blocker amlodipine slows the progression of nephropathy in patients with type 2 diabetes independently of its capacity to lower the systemic blood pressure. We randomly assigned 1715 hypertensive patients with nephropathy due to type 2 diabetes to treatment with irbesartan (300 mg daily), amlodipine (10 mg daily), or placebo. The target blood pressure was 135/85 mm Hg or less in all groups. We compared the groups with regard to the time to the primary composite end point of a doubling of the base-line serum creatinine concentration, the development of end-stage renal disease, or death from any cause. We also compared them with regard to the time to a secondary, cardiovascular composite end point. The mean duration of follow-up was 2.6 years. Treatment with irbesartan was associated with a risk of the primary composite end point that was 20 percent lower than that in the placebo group (P=0.02) and 23 percent lower than that in the amlodipine group (P=0.006). The risk of a doubling of the serum creatinine concentration was 33 percent lower in the irbesartan group than in the placebo group (P=0.003) and 37 percent lower in the irbesartan group than in the amlodipine group (P<0.001). Treatment with irbesartan was associated with a relative risk of end-stage renal disease that was 23 percent lower than that in both other groups (P=0.07 for both comparisons). These differences were not explained by differences in the blood pressures that were achieved. The serum creatinine concentration increased 24 percent more slowly in the irbesartan group than in the placebo group (P=0.008) and 21 percent more slowly than in the amlodipine group (P=0.02). There were no significant differences in the rates of death from any cause or in the cardiovascular composite end point. The angiotensin-II-receptor blocker irbesartan is effective in protecting against the progression of nephropathy due to type 2 diabetes. This protection is independent of the reduction in blood pressure it causes.","In patients with type 2 diabetes and hypertension, macroalbuminuria, and serum creatinine >1.5 mg/dL, ARBs are effective in slowing the progression of diabetic nephropathy."
"Should we treat elevated cholesterol in elderly patients
Lowering the blood cholesterol level may reduce the risk of coronary heart disease. This double-blind study was designed to determine whether the administration of pravastatin to men with hypercholesterolemia and no history of myocardial infarction reduced the combined incidence of nonfatal myocardial infarction and death from coronary heart disease. We randomly assigned 6595 men, 45 to 64 years of age, with a mean (+/- SD) plasma cholesterol level of 272 +/- 23 mg per deciliter (7.0 +/- 0.6 mmol per liter) to receive pravastatin (40 mg each evening) or placebo. The average follow-up period was 4.9 years. Medical records, electrocardiographic recordings, and the national death registry were used to determine the clinical end points. Pravastatin lowered plasma cholesterol levels by 20 percent and low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol levels by 26 percent, whereas there was no change with placebo. There were 248 definite coronary events (specified as nonfatal myocardial infarction or death from coronary heart disease) in the placebo group, and 174 in the pravastatin group (relative reduction in risk with pravastatin, 31 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 17 to 43 percent; P < 0.001). There were similar reductions in the risk of definite nonfatal myocardial infarctions (31 percent reduction, P < 0.001), death from coronary heart disease (definite cases alone: 28 percent reduction, P = 0.13; definite plus suspected cases: 33 percent reduction, P = 0.042), and death from all cardiovascular causes (32 percent reduction, P = 0.033). There was no excess of deaths from noncardiovascular causes in the pravastatin group. We observed a 22 percent reduction in the risk of death from any cause in the pravastatin group (95 percent confidence interval, 0 to 40 percent; P = 0.051). Treatment with pravastatin significantly reduced the incidence of myocardial infarction and death from cardiovascular causes without adversely affecting the risk of death from noncardiovascular causes in men with moderate hypercholesterolemia and no history of myocardial infarction.","Available evidence addressing the benefit of lowering lipid levels in persons with elevated cholesterol but without coronary heart disease is from the West of Scotland Coronary Prevention study, which included patients aged 45 to 64 years. This study showed a 0.5% reduction in coronary heart disease mortality (NNT = 200) and a 0.9% reduction in all-cause mortality (NNT = 111). Neither reduction reached statistical significance."
"What is the prognosis for acute low back pain
To investigate the claim that 90% of episodes of low back pain that present to general practice have resolved within one month. Prospective study of all adults consulting in general practice because of low back pain over 12 months with follow up at 1 week, 3 months, and 12 months after consultation. Two general practices in south Manchester. 490 subjects (203 men, 287 women) aged 18-75 years. Proportion of patients who have ceased to consult with low back pain after 3 months; proportion of patients who are free of pain and back related disability at 3 and 12 months. Annual cumulative consultation rate among adults in the practices was 6.4%. Of the 463 patients who consulted with a new episode of low back pain, 275 (59%) had only a single consultation, and 150 (32%) had repeat consultations confined to the 3 months after initial consultation. However, of those interviewed at 3 and 12 months follow up, only 39/188 (21%) and 42/170 (25%) respectively had completely recovered in terms of pain and disability. The results are consistent with the interpretation that 90% of patients with low back pain in primary care will have stopped consulting with symptoms within three months. However most will still be experiencing low back pain and related disability one year after consultation.","A prospective study found that 94% of patients evaluated for a new episode of low back pain were no longer visiting their physician for treatment after 3 months. However, this was not an adequate measure of resolution of pain. Only 21% (39/188) were pain free at 3 months and only 25% (42/170) were pain free at 12 months."
"When should you consider implanted nerve stimulators for lower back pain
Persistent or recurrent radicular pain after lumbosacral spine surgery is often associated with nerve root compression and is treated by repeated operation or, as a last resort, by spinal cord stimulation (SCS). We conducted a prospective, randomized, controlled trial to test our hypothesis that SCS is more likely than reoperation to result in a successful outcome by standard measures of pain relief and treatment outcome, including subsequent use of health care resources. For an average of 3 years postoperatively, disinterested third-party interviewers followed 50 patients selected for reoperation by standard criteria and randomized to SCS or reoperation. If the results of the randomized treatment were unsatisfactory, patients could cross over to the alternative. Success was based on self-reported pain relief and patient satisfaction. Crossover to the alternative procedure was an outcome measure. Use of analgesics, activities of daily living, and work status were self-reported. Among 45 patients (90%) available for follow-up, SCS was more successful than reoperation (9 of 19 patients versus 3 of 26 patients, P <0.01). Patients initially randomized to SCS were significantly less likely to cross over than were those randomized to reoperation (5 of 24 patients versus 14 of 26 patients, P=0.02). Patients randomized to reoperation required increased opiate analgesics significantly more often than those randomized to SCS (P <0.025). Other measures of activities of daily living and work status did not differ significantly. SCS is more effective than reoperation as a treatment for persistent radicular pain after lumbosacral spine surgery, and in the great majority of patients, it obviates the need for reoperation.","SCS can be used to treat patients with chronic and intractable pain, such as the pain caused by failed back surgery syndrome. The syndrome, defined as persistent or recurrent pain after lumbosacral spine surgery, occurs in 10% to 40% of patients who have undergone lumbosacral spine surgery."
"How effective are lifestyle changes for controlling hypertension
Physical activity has been associated with reduced blood pressure in observational epidemiologic studies and individual clinical trials. This meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials was conducted to determine the effect of aerobic exercise on blood pressure. English-language articles published before September 2001. 54 randomized, controlled trials (2419 participants) whose intervention and control groups differed only in aerobic exercise. Using a standardized protocol and data extraction form, three of the investigators independently abstracted data on study design, sample size, participant characteristics, type of intervention, follow-up duration, and treatment outcomes. In a random-effects model, data from each trial were pooled and weighted by the inverse of the total variance. Aerobic exercise was associated with a significant reduction in mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure (-3.84 mm Hg [95% CI, -4.97 to -2.72 mm Hg] and -2.58 mm Hg [CI, -3.35 to -1.81 mm Hg], respectively). A reduction in blood pressure was associated with aerobic exercise in hypertensive participants and normotensive participants and in overweight participants and normal-weight participants. Aerobic exercise reduces blood pressure in both hypertensive and normotensive persons. An increase in aerobic physical activity should be considered an important component of lifestyle modification for prevention and treatment of high blood pressure.","A well-done systematic review and meta-analysis from 2002 (including 15 studies with 770 participants) concluded that for hypertensive patients, aerobic exercise with at least one 40-minute session of moderate intensity per week is associated with a drop in systolic blood pressure of about 5 mm Hg and a drop in diastolic blood pressure of about 4 mm Hg."
"Are there big differences among beta-blockers in treating essential hypertension
Atenolol is one of the most widely used beta blockers clinically, and has often been used as a reference drug in randomised controlled trials of hypertension. However, questions have been raised about atenolol as the best reference drug for comparisons with other antihypertensives. Thus, our aim was to systematically review the effect of atenolol on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in hypertensive patients. Reports were identified through searches of The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, relevant textbooks, and by personal communication with established researchers in hypertension. Randomised controlled trials that assessed the effect of atenolol on cardiovascular morbidity or mortality in patients with primary hypertension were included. We identified four studies that compared atenolol with placebo or no treatment, and five that compared atenolol with other antihypertensive drugs. Despite major differences in blood pressure lowering, there were no outcome differences between atenolol and placebo in the four studies, comprising 6825 patients, who were followed up for a mean of 4.6 years on all-cause mortality (relative risk 1.01 [95% CI 0.89-1.15]), cardiovascular mortality (0.99 [0.83-1.18]), or myocardial infarction (0.99 [0.83-1.19]). The risk of stroke, however, tended to be lower in the atenolol than in the placebo group (0.85 [0.72-1.01]). When atenolol was compared with other antihypertensives, there were no major differences in blood pressure lowering between the treatment arms. Our meta-analysis showed a significantly higher mortality (1.13 [1.02-1.25]) with atenolol treatment than with other active treatment, in the five studies comprising 17671 patients who were followed up for a mean of 4.6 years. Moreover, cardiovascular mortality also tended to be higher with atenolol treatment than with other antihypertensive treatment. Stroke was also more frequent with atenolol treatment. Our results cast doubts on atenolol as a suitable drug for hypertensive patients. Moreover, they challenge the use of atenolol as a reference drug in outcome trials in hypertension.","A meta-analysis reviewed 4 studies that compared atenolol with placebo or no treatment, and 5 that compared atenolol with other antihypertensive drugs. They found no outcome differences between atenolol and placebo in the 4 studies, comprising 6825 patients, followed for a mean of 4.6 years. There was no difference in all-cause mortality (relative risk [RR]=1.01; 95% CI, 0.89-1.15), cardiovascular mortality (RR=0.99; 95% CI, 0.83-1.18), or myocardial infarction (RR=0.99; 95% CI, 0.83-1.19). The risk of stroke appeared to be lower in the atenolol than in the placebo group (RR=0.85; 95% CI, 0.72-1.01). When atenolol was compared with other antihypertensives, there were no major differences in blood pressure lowering between the treatment arms. The authors found a significantly higher mortality (RR=1.13; 95% CI, 1.02-1.25) with atenolol treatment than with other active treatment, in 5 studies comprising 17,671 patients who were followed up for a mean of 4.6 years. Stroke was also more frequent with atenolol in comparison with other agents."
"Does stopping a statin increase the short-term risk of a cardiovascular event
Statins (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A [HMG-CoA] reductase inhibitors) reduce stroke damage independent of lipid lowering by upregulation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). Acute withdrawal of statin treatment may suppress endothelial NO production and impair vascular function. To test this hypothesis, we treated 129/SV mice with atorvastatin (10 mg/kg) for 14 days and then withdrew treatment. Treatment with atorvastatin conferred stroke protection by 40% after filamentous occlusion of the middle cerebral artery followed by reperfusion. Withdrawal of statin treatment, however, resulted in the loss of stroke protection after 2 and 4 days. In mouse aortas and brain vasculature, statins upregulated eNOS message 2.3- and 1.7-fold, respectively, as measured by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Withdrawal of statins resulted in 5- and 2.7-fold downregulation of eNOS in aorta and brain, respectively, after 2 days. Statin treatment decreased RhoA GTPase membrane expression to 48%, while withdrawal of statins resulted in 4-fold increase of RhoA in the membrane. Moreover, platelet factor 4 and beta-thromboglobulin in plasma were significantly downregulated by statin treatment, but withdrawal of statins resulted in a 2.9- and 3.1-fold upregulation after 2 days, respectively. Thrombus formation induced by ligature of the inferior vena cava was significantly reduced by statin treatment. When statin treatment was withdrawn, however, protection was lost between 2 and 4 days. Acute termination of statin treatment results in a rapid loss of protection in mouse models of cerebral ischemia and thrombus formation independent of lipid lowering. In patients with acute or impending stroke, withdrawal of statins may impair outcome.",Animal studies of stroke in mice showed mice whose statin was abruptly stopped had more damage from stroke than those whose statin was continued.
"What is the best treatment for nocturnal enuresis in children
To test the hypothesis that desmopressin facilitates acquisition of continence, we aimed to establish whether, in children with nocturnal enuresis who are desmopressin nonresponders, adjunct desmopressin increases the rate of sustained continence after treatment with a conditioning alarm. Study design Patients with nocturnal enuresis (n=358; age range, 6-16 years) completed a 4-week ""run-in"" course of intranasal desmopressin (20-40 microg). Of these, 207 defined as nonresponders (<50% reduction in wet nights) were randomly assigned to receive either desmopressin (n=101) or placebo (n=106) nasal spray, together with conditioning alarm therapy for 8 weeks. Principal outcome measures were remission (28 continuous dry nights) and relapse (>2 wet nights in 2 weeks after having achieved remission). Remission rates were similar in both groups (51.5% desmopressin, 48.1% placebo; 95% CI on difference, -10%, 17%; P=.63), and relapse rates were not significantly different (13.5% vs 5.9%; 95% CI on difference, -3.7%, 19%; P=.19). Although remission rates were similar, children treated with desmopressin had significantly more dry nights during treatment than those in the placebo group. Desmopressin did not act synergistically with alarm treatment to achieve remission. Therefore, we infer that in partial or nonresponders, desmopressin does not enhance learning.",One randomized controlled trials in which desmopressin nonresponders were supplemented with alarms showed no added benefit in remission rates compared with conditioning alarms plus placebo (51% vs 48% in achieving 28 dry nights). Neither was there added benefit in relapse rates once treatment stopped.
"Can you differentiate bacterial from viral pediatric infections based on the CBC
Enumeration of band neutrophils has a long clinical tradition as a diagnostic test for bacterial infection. Yet, the band count is a nonspecific, inaccurate, and imprecise laboratory test. Review of the literature provides little support for the clinical utility of the band count in patients greater than 3 months of age. The white blood cell count and the automated absolute neutrophil count are better diagnostic tests for adults and most children. Absolute numbers of bands are required for the Rochester criteria, a diagnostic algorithm for acutely ill, febrile children less than 3 months of age. No studies, however, assess the independent contribution of bands to the performance of the algorithm, or the use of the automated total neutrophil count as a replacement for the band count. Band counts also are required to calculate an immature to total neutrophil ratio (I:T ratio), an index widely used to aid in the diagnosis of neonatal sepsis. Studies, however, show a wide range of sensitivity and specificity for the I:T ratio, indicating variable performance. In the near future, rapid analysis of inflammatory factors, adhesion molecules, cytokines, neutrophil surface antigens, or even bacterial DNA may be superior alternative tests for the early diagnosis of sepsis.",The band count alone does not accurately predict serious bacterial infection.
"Which treatments work best for hemorrhoids
Few data exist on the actual recurrence rates of thrombosed external hemorrhoids. We wished to determine the incidence of recurrence, intervals to recurrence, and factors predicting recurrence of thrombosed external hemorrhoids after conservative or surgical management. Two hundred and thirty-one consecutive patients with thrombosed external hemorrhoids treated from 1990 to 2002 were identified. Recurrence was defined as complete resolution of the index lesion with subsequent return of a thrombosed external hemorrhoid and did not include patients with chronic symptoms. Data were gathered retrospectively. Multiple potential risk factors were reviewed. The index thrombosed external hemorrhoid was managed conservatively in 51.5 percent of cases and surgically in 48.5 percent. There were no differences between groups in gender, age, or race, and 44.5 percent of all patients had a prior history of thrombosed external hemorrhoid. A prior history was less common in the conservative group than in the surgical group (38.1 percent vs. 51.3 percent; P < 0.05). The frequency of pain or bleeding as the primary complaint was higher in the surgical group ( P < 0.001 and P < 0.002). In addition, the surgical group was more likely to report all three symptoms of pain, bleeding, and a lump ( P < 0.005). Mean follow-up was 7.6 months, with the range extending to 7 years. Time to symptom resolution averaged 24 days in the conservative group vs. 3.9 days in the surgical group ( P < 0.0001). The overall incidence to recurrence was 15.6 percent-80.6 percent in the conservative group vs. 19.4 percent in the surgical group. The rate of recurrence in the conservative group was 25.4 percent (4/29; 14 percent were excised) whereas only 6.3 percent of the surgical patients had recurrence ( P < 0.0001). Mean time to recurrence was 7.1 months in the conservative group vs. 25 months in the surgical group ( P < 0.0001). Survival analysis for time to recurrence of thrombosed external hemorrhoid indicated that time to recurrence was significantly longer for the surgical group ( P < 0.0001). Logistic regression analysis of multiple factors (including diverticular disease, constipation, straining, benign prostatic hypertrophy, diarrhea, skin tags, history of travel, anoreceptive sex, anal fissures, internal hemorrhoids, and obesity) was performed to determine the outcome of each group. None of these variables were significant predictors of recurrence. Patients whose initial presentation was pain or bleeding with or without a lump were more like to be treated surgically. Surgically treated patients had a lower frequency of recurrence and a longer time interval to recurrence than conservatively treated patients. None of the variables analyzed were significant predictors of a particular treatment, except for a prior history of thrombosed external hemorrhoids, which may represent patient choice. Although most patients treated conservatively will experience resolution of their symptoms, excision of thrombosed external hemorrhoids results in more rapid symptom resolution, lower incidence of recurrence, and longer remission intervals.",A retrospective study of 231 patients treated conservatively or surgically found that the 48.5% of patients treated surgically had a lower recurrence rate than the conservative group (number needed to treat [NNT]=2 for recurrence at mean follow-up of 7.6 months) and earlier resolution of symptoms (average 3.9 days compared with 24 days for conservative treatment).
"Should you treat a symptomatic patient by phone when his child has confirmed strep throat
Sore throat is a very common reason for people to present for medical care. Although it remits spontaneously, primary care doctors commonly prescribe antibiotics for it. To assess the benefits of antibiotics for sore throat. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) (The Cochrane Library, Issue 1, 2006), MEDLINE (January 1966 to March 2006) and EMBASE (January 1990 to December 2005). Trials of antibiotic against control with either measures of the typical symptoms (throat soreness, headache or fever), or suppurative or non-suppurative complications of sore throat. Potential studies were screened independently by two authors for inclusion, with differences in opinion resolved by discussion. Data were then independently extracted from studies selected by inclusion by two authors. Researchers from three studies were contacted for additional information. There were 27 studies with 2835 cases of sore throat. 1. Non-suppurative complications: There was a trend for antibiotics to protect against acute glomerulonephritis, but there were insufficient cases to be sure. Several studies found antibiotics reduced acute rheumatic fever by more than two thirds (relative risk (RR) 0.22; 95% CI 0.02 to 2.08). 2. Suppurative complications: Antibiotics reduced the incidence of acute otitis media (RR 0.30; 95% CI 0.15 to 0.58); of acute sinusitis (RR 0.48; 95% CI 0.08 to 2.76); and of quinsy (peritonsillar abscess) compared to those taking placebo (RR 0.15; 95% CI 0.05 to 0.47). 3. Throat soreness and fever were reduced by antibiotics by about one half. The greatest difference was seen at about 3 to 4 days (when the symptoms of about 50% of untreated patients had settled). By one week about 90% of treated and untreated patients were symptom-free. The overall number need to treat to prevent one sore throat at day 3 was just under six (95% CI 4.9 to 7.0); at week 1 it was 21 (95% CI 13.2 to 47.9). 4. Subgroup analyses of symptom reduction: Analysis by: age; blind versus unblinded; or use of antipyretics, found no significant differences. Analysis of results of throat swabs showed that antibiotics were more effective against symptoms at day 3, RR 0.58 (95% CI 0.48 to 0.71) if the swabs were positive for Streptococcus, compared to RR 0.78 (95% CI 0.63 to 0.97) if negative. Similarly at week 1, RRs 0.29 (95% CI 0.12 to 0.70) for positive, and 0.73 (95% CI 0.50 to 1.07) for negative swabs. Antibiotics confer relative benefits in the treatment of sore throat. However, the absolute benefits are modest. Protecting sore throat sufferers against suppurative and non-suppurative complications in modern Western society can only be achieved by treating many with antibiotics, most of whom will derive no benefit. In emerging economies (where rates of acute rheumatic fever are high, for example), the number needed to treat may be much lower for antibiotics to be considered effective. Antibiotics shorten the duration of symptoms by about sixteen hours overall.","The number needed to treat (NNT) for antibiotics given to GABHS-positive patients is 3.5 for resolution of symptoms by day 3; for GABHS-negative patients it is 5.5, and for patients who did not have a culture, it is 14.5. When properly prescribed, antibiotics decrease communicability of group a beta-hemolytic streptococci to 24 hours, and symptoms by 1 day (NNT=5 patients to decrease symptoms). Antibiotics also decrease the incidence of rheumatic heart disease (NNT=100) and peritonsillar abscesses. Due to the decreased incidence of glomerulonephritis, the evidence is inadequate to determine the role of antibiotics in preventing this complication."
"What is the best therapy for superficial thrombophlebitis
To assess the clinical efficacy of a topical gel containing 1000 IU x g(-1) of heparin, applied three times daily for a maximal period of 7 days to patients with acute superficial phlebitis secondary to indwelling intravenous catheter. A Double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study was conducted in one of the internal medicine wards of a tertiary General Hospital in Barcelona, Spain. Inpatients of both genders over 18 years of age that developed superficial phlebitis and gave informed consent were included in the study. The sample size estimation was 132 patients. Sixty-six patients were allocated to each group. There were five protocol deviations and 24 withdrawals in the intervention group, and one protocol deviation and 25 withdrawals in the control group. Consequently, 37 patients in the intervention group and 40 in the control group completed the trial. The main outcome measure was the disappearance of the symptoms and signs of superficial phlebitis. Clinical course, investigator's global impression and adverse events were also recorded. According to the intention-to-treat analysis, after treatment for 7 days superficial phlebitis healed in 27 of the 61 patients (44.3%) who received topical heparin, and in 17 of the 65 patients (26.1%) receiving placebo, giving a relative risk [95% confidence interval (CI)] of 1.69 (1.03-2.78). This indicates that six patients (95% CI, 3-72) have to be treated in order to induce one additional healing. The clinical course and the overall clinical impression were similar in both groups. One patient treated with topical heparin developed mild urticaria. Topical heparin is safe and effective for the treatment of superficial phlebitis secondary to indwelling intravenous catheter.","A double-blind trial of topical heparin showed it to be superior to placebo in reducing symptoms and speeding healing. The study showed that (n=126), 44% of patients treated with 1000 IU/g heparin gel 3 times a day were symptom-free at 1 week, compared with 26% on placebo (NNT=6)."
"When should you order a Lyme titer
Although rapid diagnosis of Lyme disease is essential for effective treatment, there is concern about inappropriate testing. We conducted a prospective, cross-sectional survey of clinicians to assess the use and appropriateness of Lyme disease serologic tests (LDSTs). LDSTs performed at 2 large Wisconsin reference laboratories were systematically sampled for 12 consecutive months. A standardized questionnaire was used to gather data about the submitting clinician and the patient tested. Tests were categorized as appropriate, inappropriate, or discretionary, and associations were assessed using logistic regression analysis. A test was defined as inappropriate if the patient was asymptomatic, had erythema migrans, or was treated empirically, or if the test was ordered as a test of cure. We surveyed 303 clinicians regarding 356 LDSTs: 72 tests (20%) were appropriate, 95 (27%) were inappropriate, and 189 (53%) were discretionary. Tests were more likely to be inappropriate if they were ordered by an emergency or urgent care physician compared with other specialists (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 5.2, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3-20.6), or if preceded by a known tick bite (AOR 6.8, 95% CI, 2.6-17.6). The patient rather than the clinician requested 26% of tests, which were more likely to be inappropriate than clinician-requested tests (crude odds ratio [COR] 5.8, 95% CI, 2.5-13.6). Tests were more likely to be patient-requested if they were ordered by an internist (AOR 2.6, 95% CI, 1.4-4.8) or if the patient was > or =40 years old (AOR 2.2, 95% CI, 1.3-3.9). Many LDSTs are ordered inappropriately, often influenced by patient demand. Education of clinicians and patients about testing indications and contraindications is needed to reduce the number of inappropriate LDSTs.","In a prospective, crosssectional survey of Wisconsin physicians, only 20% of ordered tests were appropriate. Tests were classified as inappropriate if ordered (1) for asymptomatic patients, (2) for patients with physician-diagnosed erythema migrans, (3) for patients receiving empiric antibiotic treatment, or (4) as test-of-cure."
"What are the best therapies for acute migraine in pregnancy
We prospectively compared pregnancy outcome after exposure to sumatriptan with that of disease-matched controls and nonteratogen controls. There were no differences in the rates of live births, spontaneous abortions, therapeutic abortions, or major birth defects among the three groups. This first prospective report suggests that the use of sumatriptan during organogenesis is not associated with an apparent increased risk of major birth defects.",One prospective controlled cohort study showed an increase in miscarriage rates that did not reach statistical significance.
"What treatment approach to intrapartum maternal fever has the best fetal outcomes
Acute chorioamnionitis occurs relatively frequently in pregnancy and may result in significant fetal and neonatal morbidity. Although there is no unanimity of opinion regarding the most efficacious antibiotic regimen for the treatment of this complication, there is a consensus, at least among obstetricians, that maternal treatment may have an impact on neonatal outcome. It appears that the fetus and neonate benefit from ""intrauterine"" treatment. Virtually all antibiotics cross the placenta, and fortunately most are relatively safe for use during pregnancy.","One study randomized 133 women into 2 arms-treatment with ampicillin, gentamicin, and clindamycin compared with ampicillin and gentamicin alone-and found no additional benefit in regards to neonatal sepsis (RR=2.16; 95% CI, 0.20-23.21) or neonatal death (RR=0.72; 95% CI, 0.12-4.16)"
"What is the best management for patients with evidence of asymptomatic ischemia on exercise stress testing
To evaluate the relationship between changes in physical fitness and risk of mortality in men. Prospective study, with two clinical examinations (mean interval between examinations, 4.9 years) to assess change or lack of change in physical fitness as associated with risk of mortality during follow-up after the subsequent examination (mean follow-up from subsequent examination, 5.1 years). Preventive medicine clinic. Participants were 9777 men given two preventive medical examinations, each of which included assessment of physical fitness by maximal exercise tests and evaluation of health status. All cause (n = 223) and cardiovascular disease (n = 87) mortality. The highest age-adjusted all-cause death rate was observed in men who were unfit at both examinations (122.0/10,000 man-years); the lowest death rate was in men who were physically fit at both examinations (39.6/10,000 man-years). Men who improved from unfit to fit between the first and subsequent examinations had an age-adjusted death rate of 67.7/10,000 man-years. This is a reduction in mortality risk of 44% (95% confidence interval, 25% to 59%) relative to men who remained unfit at both examinations. Improvement in fitness was associated with lower death rates after adjusting for age, health status, and other risk factors of premature mortality. For each minute increase in maximal treadmill time between examinations, there was a corresponding 7.9% (P = .001) decrease in risk of mortality. Similar results were seen when the group was stratified by health status, and for cardiovascular disease mortality. Men who maintained or improved adequate physical fitness were less likely to die from all causes and from cardiovascular disease during follow-up than persistently unfit men. Physicians should encourage unfit men to improve their fitness by starting a physical activity program.","Smoking cessation is also important, associated with 41% lower mortality (95% CI, 20-57)."
"Are there any known health risks to early introduction of solids to an infant's diet
The relationship between early solid feeding practices and risks of recurrent or chronic eczema in childhood was examined in a birth cohort of New Zealand children studied to the age of 10. By the age of 10 years, 7.5% of children had chronic or recurrent eczema. There were clear and consistent associations between the diversity of the child's diet during the first 4 months and risks of eczema. Even when due allowance was made for a range of confounding factors--including parental atopic illness, atopic illness in siblings, the child's early milk diet, and family social background--children exposed to four or more different types of solid food before 4 months had risks of recurrent or chronic eczema that were 2.9 times those of children who were not exposed to early solid feeding. It is concluded that early exposure to a diet diverse in potential food antigens may act to predispose susceptible children to recurrent or chronic childhood eczema.",A 10-year New Zealand cohort study (N=1265) showed some evidence of an association between early solid introduction and eczema. The study concluded that introducing solids and increasing food diversity before 4 months of age was associated with eczema at 2 to 10 years.
"Is yearly chest x-ray screening helpful in reducing mortality for smokers
The Mayo Lung Project (MLP) was a randomized, controlled clinical trial of lung cancer screening that was conducted in 9211 male smokers between 1971 and 1983. The intervention arm was offered chest x-ray and sputum cytology every 4 months for 6 years; the usual-care arm was advised at trial entry to receive the same tests annually. No lung cancer mortality benefit was evident at the end of the study. We have extended follow-up through 1996. A National Death Index-PLUS search was used to assign vital status and date and cause of death for 6523 participants with unknown information. The median survival for lung cancer patients diagnosed before July 1, 1983, was calculated by use of Kaplan-Meier estimates. Survival curves were compared with the log-rank test. The median follow-up time was 20.5 years. Lung cancer mortality was 4.4 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 3.9-4.9) deaths per 1000 person-years in the intervention arm and 3.9 (95% CI = 3.5-4.4) in the usual-care arm (two-sided P: for difference =.09). For participants diagnosed with lung cancer before July 1, 1983, survival was better in the intervention arm (two-sided P: =.0039). The median survival for patients with resected early-stage disease was 16.0 years in the intervention arm versus 5.0 years in the usual-care arm. Extended follow-up of MLP participants did not reveal a lung cancer mortality reduction for the intervention arm. Similar mortality but better survival for individuals in the intervention arm indicates that some lesions with limited clinical relevance may have been identified in the intervention arm.","No significant difference in lung cancer mortality, even after an extended follow-up of 20.5 years. Adding sputum cytology to chest x-ray only improved lung cancer detection rates over chest x-ray alone."
"In menopausal women, does fatigue indicate disease
Data remain sparse on women's prodromal symptoms before acute myocardial infarction (AMI). This study describes prodromal and AMI symptoms in women. Participants were 515 women diagnosed with AMI from 5 sites. Using the McSweeney Acute and Prodromal Myocardial Infarction Symptom Survey, we surveyed them 4 to 6 months after discharge, asking about symptoms, comorbidities, and demographic characteristics. Women were predominantly white (93%), high school educated (54.8%), and older (mean age, 66+/-12), with 95% (n=489) reporting prodromal symptoms. The most frequent prodromal symptoms experienced more than 1 month before AMI were unusual fatigue (70.7%), sleep disturbance (47.8%), and shortness of breath (42.1%). Only 29.7% reported chest discomfort, a hallmark symptom in men. The most frequent acute symptoms were shortness of breath (57.9%), weakness (54.8%), and fatigue (42.9%). Acute chest pain was absent in 43%. Women had more acute (mean, 7.3+/-4.8; range, 0 to 29) than prodromal (mean, 5.71+/-4.36; range, 0 to 25) symptoms. The average prodromal score, symptom weighted by frequency and intensity, was 58.5+/-52.7, whereas the average acute score, symptom weighted by intensity, was 16.5+/-12.1. These 2 scores were correlated (r=0.61, P<0.001). Women with more prodromal symptoms experienced more acute symptoms. After controlling for risk factors, prodromal scores accounted for 33.2% of acute symptomatology. Most women have prodromal symptoms before AMI. It remains unknown whether prodromal symptoms are predictive of future events.","A retrospective study of 515 women 4 to 6 months after a myocardial infarction explored self-reported symptoms. The mean age was 66±12 years and 93% were white. Unusual fatigue was the most frequent prodromal symptom experienced by 70.7% of women 1 month before a myocardial infarction, with 42.9% reporting fatigue in the acute setting. Though this retrospective study is limited both by its methodological quality and by the narrow population studied, the results suggest a gender difference between men and women in their report of symptoms of coronary artery disease."
"Does tamoxifen prevent breast cancer
Tamoxifen, a drug with antioestrogenic effects, is predicted to prevent the occurrence of breast cancer. We have undertaken a trial of tamoxifen in healthy women who are at increased risk of breast cancer because of family history. We report a planned interim analysis. Between October, 1986, and April, 1996, we accrued 2494 healthy women aged between 30 and 70 with a family history of breast cancer. They have been randomised (double blind) to receive tamoxifen 20 mg per day orally or placebo for up to 8 years. Follow-up included clinical assessment, annual mammography, and assessment of toxicity and compliance. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of breast cancer, which was analysed on an intention-to-treat basis with a survival curve. With a median follow-up of 70 months, 2471 women (tamoxifen 1238, placebo 1233) were suitable for analysis. The groups were evenly matched at baseline, and compliance was good. The overall frequency of breast cancer is the same for women on tamoxifen or placebo (tamoxifen 34, placebo 36, relative risk 1.06 [95% CI 0.7-1.7], p=0.8). Participants who were already on hormone-replacement therapy when they entered the study had an increased risk of breast cancer compared with non-users. Those participants who started such therapy while on trial had a significantly reduced risk. The safety profile of tamoxifen was as expected. We have been unable to show any effect of tamoxifen on breast-cancer incidence in healthy women, contrary to the report from the NSABP-P1 study showing a 45% reduction in healthy women given tamoxifen versus placebo. Differences in the study populations for the two trials may underlie these conflicting findings: eligibility in our trial was based predominantly on a strong family history of breast cancer whereas in the NSABP trial was mostly based on non-genetic risk factors. The importance of oestrogen promotion may vary between such populations.","An randomized controlled trials reported no benefit from tamoxifen in young women with at least one first-degree relative with breast cancer. hormone replacement therapy was allowed, and the study had 90% power to detect a reduction of 50% in breast cancer incidence. Authors estimated that 36% of participants and 60% of women who developed breast cancer had a greater than 80% chance of having a breast cancer predisposition gene. Breast cancers in women with the Breast Cancer 1 gene (BRCA1) are more likely to be extended-release negative."
"What is the role of tacrolimus and pimecrolimus in atopic dermatitis
To compare the efficacy and safety of tacrolimus ointment and pimecrolimus cream in adult and pediatric patients with mild to very severe atopic dermatitis (AD). One thousand and sixty-five patients were randomized to treatment in 3 multicenter, randomized, investigator-blinded, 6-week studies. Based on the Eczema Area Severity Index (EASI), tacrolimus ointment was more effective than pimecrolimus cream at the end of the study in adults (54.1% vs. 34.9%, respectively; P < .0001), in children with moderate/severe disease (67.2% vs. 56.4%, respectively; P = .04), in the combined analysis (52.8% vs. 39.1%, respectively; P < .0001), and at week 1 in children with mild disease (39.2% vs. 31.2%, respectively; P = .04). Tacrolimus was also more effective than pimecrolimus based on the Investigator Global AD Assessment (IGADA), improvement in percentage of total body surface area affected, and improvement in itch scores (P < or = .05), with a faster onset of action. There was no significant difference in the incidence of adverse events (AEs), including application site reactions in the 2 studies involving 650 children. Adults treated with tacrolimus experienced a greater number of local application site reactions on day 1; both groups reported a similar incidence of application site reactions thereafter. More pimecrolimus-treated patients than tacrolimus-treated patients withdrew from the studies because of a lack of efficacy (P < or = .03) or adverse events (P = .002; pediatric mild). Tacrolimus ointment is more effective and has a faster onset of action than pimecrolimus cream in adults and children with AD; their safety profiles are similar.","In a meta-analysis of 3 randomized studies of head-to-head comparison of pimecrolimus 1% and tacrolimus 0.03% or 0.1% among children and adults, tacrolimus ointment was more effective than pimecrolimus cream at the end of the study for adults (P<.0001), for children with moderate-to-severe disease (P=.04), in the combined analysis (P<.0001), and at week 1 for children with mild disease (P=.04). No significant difference was seen in the incidence of adverse effects, although more pimecrolimus-treated patients withdrew from the studies because of a lack of efficacy (P≤.03) or adverse events (P=.002; pediatric mild)."
"What are the most effective treatments for bacterial vaginosis in nonpregnant women
The purpose of this article is to review the treatment options for bacterial vaginosis, including the newer topical antibiotics, metronidazole gel and clindamycin cream. The article also examines the controversies over whether bacterial vaginosis is a sexually transmitted disease and whether asymptomatic women should be treated. A MEDLINE search was conducted to identify pertinent literature, including review articles. Emphasis was placed on those clinical trials using metronidazole gel or clindamycin cream. Studies addressing the complications of bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy, the risk of treatment in pregnancy, and the method of transmission of the disease also were reviewed. Clinical studies evaluating clindamycin cream and metronidazole gel were scarce; therefore, data from all available trials were reviewed. The objectives, methodology, and results from other studies were reviewed; those addressing complications of the disease and risks and benefits of treatment were included. There is evidence both for and against bacterial vaginosis being a sexually transmitted disease. Potential complications of the disease may warrant treatment of certain asymptomatic women, especially during pregnancy. Treatment options include oral or vaginal metronidazole or clindamycin, all of which provide high cure rates. Vaginal antibiotics result in minimal risk to the fetus in pregnant patients. Complications of bacterial vaginosis may be associated with significant morbidity, especially among pregnant women. Treatment of asymptomatic women with the disease is controversial, but may be justified in certain high-risk populations. The topical agents, clindamycin vaginal cream 2% and metronidazole vaginal gel 0.75% provide a safe, effective, but expensive alternative to oral antibiotic regimens for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis.",One review reports that ampicillin and erythromycin are ineffective and ampicillin sulbactam and ciprofloxacin are less effective than oral metronidazole.
"What are the most effective treatments for bacterial vaginosis in nonpregnant women
We reviewed data on the treatment of bacterial vaginosis published from 1993 through 1996. For nonpregnant women, we recommend use of metronidazole (500 mg orally twice daily for 7 days), clindamycin vaginal cream (2%, once daily for 7 days), or metronidazole vaginal gel (0.75%, twice daily for 5 days) as the preferred treatment for bacterial vaginosis. For pregnant high-risk women (women with a prior preterm birth), the objective of the treatment is to prevent adverse outcomes of pregnancy, in addition to relief of symptoms. Thus, systemic therapy for possible subclinical upper tract infection as well as medication that has been studied in pregnant women are preferable. Therefore, we recommend metronidazole (250 mg orally three times a day for 7 days). For pregnant low-risk women (women without a prior preterm birth) with symptomatic disease, the main objective of the treatment is to relieve symptoms. We recommend metronidazole (250 mg orally three times a day for 7 days). Data do not support routine treatment of male sex partners.","One systematic review calculated cure rates from 5 randomized controlled trials comparing oral metronidazole, clindamycin 2% vaginal cream, and metronidazole 0.75% vaginal gel. Cumulative cure rates at 5 to 10 days and 4 weeks post-treatment were essentially equal for all treatments. The most common side effects were vaginal Candida infections (for both treatments) and gastrointestional symptoms (for metronidazole tablets and gels)."
"What regimens eradicate Heliobacter pylori
It is not clear which dose of clarithromycin (500 mg b.d. or 250 mg b.d.) is more effective for Helicobacter pylori eradication in proton pump inhibitor-based triple therapies. We undertook a meta-analysis of the effect of 7-day triple therapies consisting of a proton pump inhibitor (P), and clarithromycin (C) and amoxycillin (A) or metronidazole (M). A meta-analysis of all clinical trials performed in an adult population and published in English up to March 1998 was undertaken. Studies with doses of clarithromycin 500 mg b.d. or 250 mg b.d. only were included. A total of 82 studies (31 papers and 51 abstracts) involving 110 treatment arms and 6123 patients were analysed that met the predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria. In the PAC combination, the pooled eradication rate in patients treated with clarithromycin 500 mg b.d. was 89.5% (95% CI: 86.9-92. 0%) by per protocol analysis and 86.6% (95% CI: 81.0-89.3%) by intention-to-treat analysis. These rates are significantly higher than those achieved with clarithromycin 250 mg b.d. (83.3% by per protocol and 78.2% by intention-to-treat analysis, both P < 0.0001). This difference was confirmed in head-to-head comparative studies. In the PMC regimen, clarithromycin 500 mg b.d. eradicated 90.8% (95% CI: 87.0-94.5%) of the infections compared to 88.5% (95% CI: 85.5-91. 5%) in patients treated with clarithromycin 250 mg b.d. by per protocol analysis (P = 0.082). The corresponding rates by intention-to-treat analysis for clarithromycin 500 mg b.d. and 250 mg b.d. was 88.3% and 86.7%, respectively (P = 0.259). Seven-day triple therapies with a proton pump inhibitor, clarithromycin and amoxycillin or metronidazole are highly effective treatments for the eradication of H. pylori. Clarithromycin 500 mg b. d. should be used in these combinations to achieve the best first treatment results, which can minimize the subsequent development of bacterial resistance to clarithromycin and metronidazole.","A high-quality systematic review of 82 studies using 7-day triple therapy found clarithromycin 500 twice daily yielded a higher eradication rate than clarithromycin 250 mg twice daily when combined with a proton pump inhibitors and amoxicillin (87% vs 81%; P<.0001). When clarithromycin was combined with a proton pump inhibitors and metronidazole, the higher dose of clarithromycin did not yield significantly higher eradication rates (88% vs 89%, P=.259)."
"What measures relieve postherpetic neuralgia
Neuropathic pain treatment remains unsatisfactory despite a substantial increase in the number of trials. This EFNS Task Force aimed at evaluating the existing evidence about the pharmacological treatment of neuropathic pain. Studies were identified using first the Cochrane Database then Medline. Trials were classified according to the aetiological condition. All class I and II controlled trials (according to EFNS classification of evidence) were assessed, but lower-class studies were considered in conditions that had no top level studies. Only treatments feasible in an outpatient setting were evaluated. Effects on pain symptoms/signs, quality of life and comorbidities were particularly searched for. Most of the randomized controlled trials included patients with postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) and painful polyneuropathies (PPN) mainly caused by diabetes. These trials provide level A evidence for the efficacy of tricyclic antidepressants, gabapentin, pregabalin and opioids, with a large number of class I trials, followed by topical lidocaine (in PHN) and the newer antidepressants venlafaxine and duloxetine (in PPN). A small number of controlled trials were performed in central pain, trigeminal neuralgia, other peripheral neuropathic pain states and multiple-aetiology neuropathic pains. The main peripheral pain conditions respond similarly well to tricyclic antidepressants, gabapentin, and pregabalin, but some conditions, such as HIV-associated polyneuropathy, are more refractory. There are too few studies on central pain, combination therapy, and head-to-head comparison. For future trials, we recommend to assess quality of life and pain symptoms or signs with standardized tools.","A Systematic Review concluded that tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are effective treatments for PHN. It found gabapentin to be effective, with a range of number needed to treat from 2.8 to 5.3 for as much as 50% pain reduction based on the visual analog score (VAS)."

Behavioral weight loss interventions achieve short-term success, but re-gain is common. To compare 2 weight loss maintenance interventions with a self-directed control group. Two-phase trial in which 1032 overweight or obese adults (38% African American, 63% women) with hypertension, dyslipidemia, or both who had lost at least 4 kg during a 6-month weight loss program (phase 1) were randomized to a weight-loss maintenance intervention (phase 2). Enrollment at 4 academic centers occurred August 2003-July 2004 and randomization, February-December 2004. Data collection was completed in June 2007. After the phase 1 weight-loss program, participants were randomized to one of the following groups for 30 months: monthly personal contact, unlimited access to an interactive technology-based intervention, or self-directed control. Main Outcome Changes in weight from randomization. Mean entry weight was 96.7 kg. During the initial 6-month program, mean weight loss was 8.5 kg. After randomization, weight regain occurred. Participants in the personal-contact group regained less weight (4.0 kg) than those in the self-directed group (5.5 kg; mean difference at 30 months, -1.5 kg; 95% confidence interval [CI], -2.4 to -0.6 kg; P = .001). At 30 months, weight regain did not differ between the interactive technology-based (5.2 kg) and self-directed groups (5.5 kg; mean difference -0.3 kg; 95% CI, -1.2 to 0.6 kg; P = .51); however, weight regain was lower in the interactive technology-based than in the self-directed group at 18 months (mean difference, -1.1 kg; 95% CI, -1.9 to -0.4 kg; P = .003) and at 24 months (mean difference, -0.9 kg; 95% CI, -1.7 to -0.02 kg; P = .04). At 30 months, the difference between the personal-contact and interactive technology-based group was -1.2 kg (95% CI -2.1 to -0.3; P = .008). Effects did not differ significantly by sex, race, age, and body mass index subgroups. Overall, 71% of study participants remained below entry weight. The majority of individuals who successfully completed an initial behavioral weight loss program maintained a weight below their initial level. Monthly brief personal contact provided modest benefit in sustaining weight loss, whereas an interactive technology-based intervention provided early but transient benefit. clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00054925.","In one study, 1032 overweight or obese adults with hypertension and/or dyslipidemia who completed a weight-loss program were randomly assigned to receive monthly personal contact, unlimited access to a Web-based intervention, or a self-directed control group.

"Which tool is most useful in diagnosing bipolar disorder in children
To describe new data on the incidence and impact of childhood- and adolescent-onset bipolar illness and make recommendations to help accelerate the acquisition of knowledge in this area. Two large, multicenter out-patient studies in adults with DSM-IV bipolar disorder-the Systematic Treatment Enhancement Program for Bipolar Disorder and the Bipolar Collaborative Network-were the primary sources of retrospective data on age at onset. We focused on the 2 retrospective studies because they supplied more immediate data on age at onset and long-term prognosis than current prospective studies. The 2 studies revealed that 15% to 28% of adults experienced an onset of their illness prior to age 13 years. Those with childhood versus adult onset had a more severe, complicated, and adverse course of bipolar illness, assessed retrospectively and confirmed prospectively during naturalistic treatment. The time lag from onset of first symptoms to first treatment was strongly inversely related to age at onset and averaged 16.8 +/- 10 years in those with childhood onset. Recommendations include defining temporary consensus threshold criteria for each bipolar subtype and their prodromes; conducting studies using less onerous than traditional designs, including randomized open comparisons to acquire preliminary data in this age cohort; and forming clinical and academic treatment outcome networks to more quickly acquire treatment outcome data in this understudied population. The data reveal a very substantial rate of childhood-onset bipolar illness, extraordinary delays in onset to first treatment, and a very adverse long-term outcome. Several approaches to accelerating the rate of acquisition of treatment outcome data in this cohort are outlined.","Retrospective analysis of 2 large cohort studies of adults with bipolar disorder indicated that at least 50% of these patients had an onset of illness before age 19, establishing support for the presence of bipolar disorder among children and adolescents."
"How should you further evaluate an adult with a testicular mass
The objectives of this study were to: (1) establish the causes of scrotal swelling in the hospital catchment population; (2) define the role of high frequency ultrasound examination in the management of scrotal swelling. A retrospective study of 582 patients who had high frequency ultrasound examination was carried out. Those requiring more information on perfusion had colour doppler examination. Forty-four per cent of examinations were performed for scrotal swelling. The cause of the scrotal swelling was mainly extratesticular (75% of all scrotal swellings), hydrocele being the commonest. Of the intratesticular causes, infection (50.8%) and tumour (20.6%) were the commonest. In conclusion ultrasound examination distinguishes extratesticular (almost always benign) from intratesticular (potentially malignant) causes of scrotal swelling. Infection, trauma and torsion mimic the ultrasound appearance of tumour as do rare benign entities.","If testicular neoplasm cannot be excluded based on clinical and radiographic findings, surgery is indicated."
"Do steroid injections help with osteoarthritis of the knee
To determine the efficacy of intra-articular corticosteroid injections for osteoarthritis of the knee and to identify numbers needed to treat. Cochrane controlled trials register, Medline (1966 to 2003), Embase (1980 to 2003), hand searches, and contact with authors. Randomised controlled trial in which the efficacy of intra-articular corticosteroid injections for osteoarthritis of the knee could be ascertained. In high quality studies, the pooled relative risk for improvement in symptoms of osteoarthritis of the knee at 16-24 weeks after intra-articular corticosteroid injections was 2.09 (95% confidence interval 1.2 to 3.7) and the number needed to treat was 4.4. The pooled relative risk for improvement up to two weeks after injections was 1.66 (1.37 to 2.0). The numbers needed to treat to get one improvement in the statistically significant studies was 1.3 to 3.5 patients. Evidence supports short term (up to two weeks) improvement in symptoms of osteoarthritis of the knee after intra-articular corticosteroid injection. Significant improvement was also shown in the only methodologically sound studies addressing longer term response (16-24 weeks). A dose equivalent to 50 mg of prednisone may be needed to show benefit at 16-24 weeks.","Two studies using higher-dose steroids (prednisone equivalent dose of 37.5 to 80 mg), with or without joint lavage, assessed improvement at 16 to 24 weeks. Although neither individual study showed statistically significant differences, the pooled data from the 2 studies favored symptom improvement at 16 to 24 weeks (RR=2.09; 95% CI, 1.2-3.7; NNT=4.4)."
"What other STI testing should we do for a patient with chlamydia
A cross-sectional study of new clients with either gonorrhoea or chlamydia attending King's College Hospital in 1998. One thousand two hundred and thirty-nine women and 1141 men had gonorrhoea, chlamydia or both. Overall, 24.2% (124/512) of heterosexual men and 38.5% (136/353) of women with gonorrhoea also had chlamydia (P<0.001). Of heterosexual males 18.8% (124/660) and 13% (136/1022) of females with chlamydia also had gonorrhoea (P=0.002). Ethnicity had no effect on the proportion of co-infection after controlling for age and gender. Clients with dual infection were younger than those with either infection alone (P=0.0001). Over half of women and a quarter of men aged 15 to 19 years were dually infected so testing for both gonorrhoea and chlamydia may be appropriate in this age group in settings outside genitourinary clinics. The high proportion of cases of gonorrhoea that also have chlamydia justifies the policy of epidemiological treatment for chlamydia.","The high prevalence of coinfection of chlamydia and gonorrhea has been shown in several studies. One cross-sectional study of new clients to a hospital-based STI clinic with gonorrhea, chlamydia, or both infections found 39% of 1239 women and 24% of 1141 heterosexual men with gonorrhea also had chlamydia. Thirteen percent of females and 19% of heterosexual males with chlamydia also had gonorrhea. More than half of the women and a third of the men aged 15 to 19 had both gonorrhea and chlamydia. Patients with both STIs tended to be younger than those with one."
"What is a reasonable initial approach to the patient with fatigue
To determine the validity of a two-question case-finding instrument for depression as compared with six previously validated instruments. The test characteristics of a two-question case-finding instrument that asks about depressed mood and anhedonia were compared with six common case-finding instruments, using the Quick Diagnostic Interview Schedule as a criterion standard for the diagnosis of major depression. Urgent care clinic at the San Francisco Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center. Five hundred thirty-six consecutive adult patients without mania or schizophrenia. Measurements were two questions from the Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders patient questionnaire, both the long and short forms of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, both the long and short forms of the Book Depression Inventory, the Symptom-Driven Diagnostic System for Primary Care, the Medical Outcomes Study depression measure, and the Quick Diagnostic Interview Schedule. The prevalence of depression, as determined by the standardized interview, was 18% (97 of 536). Overall, the case-finding instruments had sensitivities of 89% to 96% and specificities of 51% to 72% for diagnosing major depression. A positive response to the two-item instrument had a sensitivity of 96% (95% confidence interval [CI], 90-99%) and a specificity of 57% (95% CI 53-62%). Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves were similar for all of the instruments, with a range of 0.82 to 0.89. The two-question case-finding instrument is a useful measure for detecting depression in primary care. It has similar test characteristics to other case-finding instruments and is less time-consuming.",A 2-question screen has good sensitivity but poor specificity (43% of nondepressed patients will be labeled as depressed by this instrument).
"What is the clinical workup for failure to thrive
To identify the relative importance of failure to thrive during infancy as a risk factor for later abuse or neglect. Whole population birth cohort (1 January to 31 December 1986) studied prospectively over a four year period. An inner city health district in London, England. 2609 births, of whom 47 were identified as having non-organic failure to thrive by first birthday. Registration on Child Protection Register, or subject to investigation of suspected abuse or neglect without registration. 2.5% (64) of birth cohort had been placed on the Child Protection Register during the period 1986-1990, and a further 1.2% (32) had been a cause for concern. The relative risk attributable to non-organic failure to thrive was 4.3 (95% CI 1.65 to 11.94) and exceeded other measured risk factors, including birth weight < 2500 g, 1.96 (95% CI 1.01 to 3.82); gestation < 35 weeks, 3.26 (95% CI 1.32 to 3.75); ordinal position > or = 4, 1.53 (95% CI 0.72 to 3.23). A multiple logistic regression confirmed the independent contribution of non-organic failure to thrive to subsequent poor parenting warranting professional intervention. Early postnatal non-organic failure to thrive is a risk factor for later serious parenting deficiencies, but previous research has overstated its importance. Within the community studied the nature of subsequent risk was (non-nutritional) neglect, rather than non-accidental injury. More than eight out of 10 cases do not give further cause for concern.","That said, other factors are responsible for poor nutritional intake in as many as 80% of cases."
"Do antibiotics interfere with the efficacy of oral contraceptives
To evaluate the evidence on possible drug interactions between antibiotics and oral contraceptives (OCs) that may lead to OC failure. MEDLINE and Lexis/Nexis Medical Library searches for 1966-1999 using the key word ""oral contraceptives,"" cross-indexed with the terms ""antibiotics,"" ""adverse effects,"" and ""pregnancy,"" and MEDLINE search using the additional MeSH term ""drug interactions."" No language restrictions were used. A total of 167 articles were retrieved for analysis. Another 32 articles were identified by review of the references cited in these publications. Articles were selected based on their ability to provide information on the relationship between antibiotic therapy and OC efficacy in otherwise compliant users (defined as women with unplanned pregnancies who reported compliance with their OC regimen). Additionally, studies that either directly measured the effects of antibiotics on the pharmacokinetics of OC components, or that analyzed the effects of antibiotics on measures of ovulation in OC users were accepted. At least 30 cases have been reported of pregnancies occurring in women taking OCs and antibiotics, particularly rifampin. Approximately 20% of pregnant women reporting to family planning or abortion clinics reported concomitant OC and antibiotic use. Information from adverse event reporting databases generally mirrors the types of information gleaned from these case reports and clinical surveys and accounts for approximately one-third of reported cases. Retrospective surveys, primarily from dermatology-based practices, also have reported 24 pregnancies in OC users who concomitantly received therapy with antibiotics, most commonly tetracyclines and penicillins. Apparent OC failure rates in clinical surveys were within the usual range expected for patterns of typical use. In pooled results obtained from relatively small populations, oral antibiotics, with the exception of rifampin, have not significantly affected the pharmacokinetics of ethinyl estradiol, levonorgestrel, and norethindrone or reduced the serum concentrations of gonadotropins. However, individual patients have been identified who experienced significant decreases in the plasma concentration of these components of OCs and who appeared to ovulate. Rifampin impairs the effectiveness of OCs. Pharmacokinetic studies of other antibiotics have not shown any systematic interaction between antibiotics and OC steroids. However, individual patients do show large decreases in the plasma concentrations of ethinyl estradiol when they take certain other antibiotics, notably tetracycline and penicillin derivatives. Because it is not possible to identify these women in advance, a cautious approach is advised.","More than 200 occurrences have been reported anecdotally, in adverse-event monitoring systems, and in retrospective surveys of oral contraceptive failure for women treated with various antibiotics. But no prospective RCTs have been done, and most of the retrospective case series have not used control groups. All the pharmacokinetic and retrospective studies have a small sample size, which may conceal an interaction within the normal oral contraceptive failure rate. 4 retrospective surveys on women taking OCs who were treated with antibiotics (erythromycin, tetracycline, minocycline, penicillin, ampicillin, sulfa, cephalosporins) found oral contraceptive failure rates of 1.2% to 1.6%, within the range for typical populations. Studies show that the coadministration of antibiotics (ampicillin, tetracycline, doxycycline, metronidazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin, temafloxacin, fluconazole, ciprofloxacin, or ofloxacin) did not reduce serum levels of either the estrogen or progestin components of the oral contraceptives."
"Is antibiotic prophylaxis effective for recurrent acute otitis media
To determine the efficacy of antibiotics for prophylaxis of recurrent otitis media and treatment of otitis media with effusion (OME) in children. MEDLINE from 1966 through April 1993, textbooks, Current Contents, and bibliographies of selected articles. Thirty-three studies initially identified were reviewed by three blinded reviewers assessing study quality and suitability for inclusion. Twenty-seven met inclusion criteria for the meta-analyses. We abstracted quantitative data and calculated rate differences (RDs) using tympanometry as the preferred outcome measure. Nine studies of antibiotic prophylaxis of recurrent otitis media with 958 subjects had an RD of 0.11 (95% confidence interval [Cl], 0.03 to 0.19) favoring antibiotic treatment. Twelve studies of short-term patient outcomes of OME with 1697 subjects had an RD favoring antibiotics of 0.16 (95% Cl, 0.03 to 0.29), while eight studies using the ear as the outcome measure with 2052 ears studied had an RD of 0.25 (95% Cl, 0.10 to 0.40). No significant difference was shown between placebo and antibiotics (RD, 0.06; 95% Cl, -0.03 to 0.14) in the eight studies of longer-term outcome of OME. Subgroup analyses by antibiotic grouping, duration of treatment, and duration of disease did not show significant differences. Antibiotics appear to have beneficial but limited effect on recurrent otitis media and short-term resolution of OME. Longer-term benefit for OME has not been shown. The findings are limited by the failure of most studies to consider potential confounders and by inability to identify groups of patients most likely to benefit.","A systematic review of antibiotic prophylaxis for recurrent acute otitis media examined 9 RCTs with a total of 958 children. Recurrent acute otitis media was defined as 3 or more episodes per 6 to 18 months. The studies were low to moderate in quality (mean methodologic quality score of 11.8 out of 29 possible points). The most commonly used antibiotics were amoxicillin, cotrimoxazole, and sulfamethoxazole, given for 3 to 24 months (dosing not reported). Children taking antibiotics had 0.11 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.03-0.19) fewer episodes of recurrent acute otitis media per patient-month than those taking placebo. The rate in the control group was 0.19 (95% CI, 0.13-0.26). Nine children would have to be treated per month to prevent 1 ear infection (NNT=9; 95% CI, 5-33). Only 2 of the 9 studies had statistically significant results; both used sulfisoxazole for 10 to 12 weeks and were of similar methodologic quality (12.5 out 29 points). A trend towards a better outcome in studies that used sulfisoxazole did not reach significance compared with those using other medications (ie, ampicillin, amoxicillin, cotrimoxazole). Shorter treatment intervals (<6 months) trended toward being more effective than longer intervals, but this also did not reach significance. Children with more frequent episodes of acute otitis media did no better than those with less frequent episodes."
"Should we screen adults for asymptomatic microhematuria
To establish strategies for treatment of asymptomatic microscopic hematuria we conducted a prospective study of 1,034 patients with this disease. The patients were examined by cystoscopy, urine cytology, abdominal ultrasound and excretory urography. On initial examination 30 highly significant lesions, including 24 cases of urological malignancies, 195 moderately significant lesions and 246 insignificant lesions were detected. In the remaining 563 patients no underlying lesion could be found. Of the 246 patients with insignificant lesions and 563 with unexplained asymptomatic microscopic hematuria followup was done in 421 at 6-month intervals for more than 1 year. A diagnosis became clear within 3 years in 22 patients, including 3 cases of bladder carcinoma and 1 of prostatic carcinoma.","A prospective cohort study similarly evaluated 1034 patients with asymptomatic micro-hematuria found through annual health screening of Japanese adults; 471 (45%) had some urologic diagnosis, including 30 (2.9%) with serious disease (urologic malignancies or progressive glomerulopathy), 195 (18.9%) with moderate disease (such as stones, infection, stable glomerulopathy), and the remainder with less serious disease."
"Do statins reduce the risk of stroke
Lower blood cholesterol concentrations have consistently been found to be strongly associated with lower risks of coronary disease but not with lower risks of stroke. Despite this observation, previous randomised trials had indicated that cholesterol-lowering statin therapy reduces the risk of stroke, but large-scale prospective confirmation has been needed. 3280 adults with cerebrovascular disease, and an additional 17256 with other occlusive arterial disease or diabetes, were randomly allocated 40 mg simvastatin daily or matching placebo. Subgroup analyses were prespecified of first ""major vascular event"" (ie, non-fatal myocardial infarction or coronary death, stroke of any type, or any revascularisation procedure) in prior disease subcategories. Subsidiary outcomes included any stroke, and stroke sub-type. Comparisons are of all simvastatin-allocated versus all placebo-allocated participants (ie, ""intention-to-treat""), which yielded an average difference in LDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L (39 mg/dL) during the 5-year treatment period. Overall, there was a highly significant 25% (95% CI 15-34) proportional reduction in the first event rate for stroke (444 [4.3%] simvastatin vs 585 [5.7%] placebo; p<0.0001), reflecting a definite 28% (19-37) reduction in presumed ischaemic strokes (p<0.0001) and no apparent difference in strokes attributed to haemorrhage (51 [0.5%] vs 53 [0.5%]; rate ratio 0.95 [0.65-1.40]; p=0.8). In addition, simvastatin reduced the numbers having transient cerebral ischaemic attacks alone (2.0% vs 2.4%; p=0.02) or requiring carotid endarterectomy or angioplasty (0.4% vs 0.8%; p=0.0003). The reduction in stroke was not significant during the first year, but was already significant (p=0.0004) by the end of the second year. Among patients with pre-existing cerebrovascular disease there was no apparent reduction in the stroke rate, but there was a highly significant 20% (8-29) reduction in the rate of any major vascular event (406 [24.7%] vs 488 [29.8%]; p=0.001). The proportional reductions in stroke were about one-quarter in each of the other subcategories of participant studied, including: those with coronary disease or diabetes; those aged under or over 70 years at entry; and those presenting with different levels of blood pressure or lipids (even when the pretreatment LDL cholesterol was below 3.0 mmol/L [116 mg/dL]). Much larger numbers of people in the present study suffered a stroke than in any previous cholesterol-lowering trial. The results demonstrate that statin therapy rapidly reduces the incidence not only of coronary events but also of ischaemic strokes, with no apparent effect on cerebral haemorrhage, even among individuals who do not have high cholesterol concentrations. Allocation to 40 mg simvastatin daily reduced the rate of ischaemic strokes by about one-quarter and so, after making allowance for non-compliance in the trial, actual use of this regimen would probably reduce the stroke rate by about a third. HPS also provides definitive evidence that statin therapy is beneficial for people with pre-existing cerebrovascular disease, even if they do not already have manifest coronary disease.","The Heart Protection Study followed 20,536 patients in the United Kingdom (aged 40-80 years), 3280 with a history of cerebrovascular disease (defined as nondisabling stroke, transient cerebral ischemic attack, or carotid endarterectomy or angioplasty) and 17,256 with other occlusive arterial disease, coronary artery disease, or diabetes. Patients were randomized to receive either simvastatin 40 mg or placebo for an average of 5 years. The endpoint was major vascular events: myocardial infarction, stroke of any type, and revascularization procedure. Simvastatin reduced the combined risk of non-fatal or fatal ischemic stroke for patients with no history of cerebrovascular disease (3.2% for simvastatin vs 4.8% with placebo; relative risk reduction=33%, number needed to treat [NNT]=63; P=.0001)."
"When should you order a Lyme titer
The use of serologic testing and its value in the diagnosis of Lyme disease remain confusing and controversial for physicians, especially concerning persons who are at low risk for the disease. The approach to diagnosing Lyme disease varies depending on the probability of disease (based on endemicity and clinical findings) and the stage at which the disease may be. In patients from endemic areas, Lyme disease may be diagnosed on clinical grounds alone in the presence of erythema migrans. These patients do not require serologic testing, although it may be considered according to patient preference. When the pretest probability is moderate (e.g., in a patient from a highly or moderately endemic area who has advanced manifestations of Lyme disease), serologic testing should be performed with the complete two-step approach in which a positive or equivocal serology is followed by a more specific Western blot test. Samples drawn from patients within four weeks of disease onset are tested by Western blot technique for both immunoglobulin M and immunoglobulin G antibodies; samples drawn more than four weeks after disease onset are tested for immunoglobulin G only. Patients who show no objective signs of Lyme disease have a low probability of the disease, and serologic testing in this group should be kept to a minimum because of the high risk of false-positive results. When unexplained non-specific systemic symptoms such as myalgia, fatigue, and paresthesias have persisted for a long time in a person from an endemic area, serologic testing should be performed with the complete two-step approach described above.","A review article recommends serologic testing for patients with a moderate pretest probability (ie, patients with objective signs of Lyme disease from a highly or moderately endemic area). Patients from highly endemic areas who present with erythema migrans have a high enough pretest probability to make the diagnosis of Lyme disease without serologic testing."
"What is the best approach to goiter for euthyroid patients
Nodular goiters are encountered commonly in clinical practice by primary care physicians, endocrinologists, surgeons, and otolaryngologists. Epidemiologic data suggest that in the United States, the incidence of such goiters is approximately 0.1% to 1.5% per year, translating into 250,000 new nodules annually. Nodular goiters are more common in women than in men, with advancing age, and after exposure to external irradiation. These goiters may be asymptomatic, with normal TSH levels (nontoxic), or may be associated with systemic thyrotoxic symptoms (toxic MNG or Plummer's disease). Diagnostic evaluation of patients with nodular goiters consists of clinical evaluation, biochemical testing, FNA, and imaging studies. The serum TSH level is a sensitive and reliable index of thyroid function. FNA results are pivotal to assess cancer risk in patient management for prominent palpable and suspicious nodules. Chest radiography, high-resolution ultrasonography, and computed tomography help to delineate the size and extent of a goiter in evaluating compression symptoms. Indications for treatment in patients with MNG include hyperthyroidism, local compression symptoms attributed to the goiter, cosmesis, and concern about malignancy based on FNA results. The use of levothyroxine suppression therapy to effectively decrease and control MNG size is controversial. Thyroid hormone should not be used, however, in patients with suppressed serum TSH levels, to avoid the development of toxic symptoms. Management of toxic MNG by surgery is well established. Radioiodine is also effective therapy for many of these patients. When treatment is necessary for nontoxic MNG, surgical excision is preferred. Our recommendations are as follows. For patients who have small, nontoxic multinodular goiters that are clinically asymptomatic, who are biochemically euthyroid according to serum TSH levels, and who have prominent palpable or suspicious nodules benign by FNA, yearly evaluation with serum TSH determinations and thyroid palpation is sufficient. Patients with modest but stable MNG size and normal serum TSH levels may also be managed by yearly clinical observation. In this second group, levothyroxine suppression therapy is often unsuccessful and has the potential for untoward effects from exogenous hyperthyroidism. For large nontoxic multinodular goiters with local compression symptoms, the preferred treatment is surgery. In patients with toxic MNG, treatment with either surgery or radioiodine is recommended, although patients with large goiters and large, autonomously functioning nodules become euthyroid more quickly following surgery.","Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging perform better for visualization of extension of thyroid tissue substernally and are also preferred for evaluation of the neck in cases of severe local complications of goiter, such as compressive symptoms."
"Which vaccinations are indicated after splenectomy
Patients with thalassemia are at increased risk for infections, especially after undergoing splenectomy. Vaccinations and antimicrobial prophylaxis are recommended in these patients, but the optimal immunization schedule for Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine is unknown. The immunogenicity of a conjugate Hib vaccine was investigated in 57 patients with thalassemia, 32 of whom had undergone splenectomy. Anti-capsular antibodies to Hib (anti-polyribosylribitol phosphate) were measured before vaccination and 2, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months after vaccination. Immunization was well tolerated. All patients achieved protective (>1 microg/mL) antibody levels. Antibody titers declined after the initial postvaccination increase, becoming undetectable in 4 patients and decreasing to concentrations of 0.15-1 microg/mL in another 2 patients when tested 2-3 years after vaccination. Hib conjugate vaccine is safe and immunogenic in patients with thalassemia major; however, additional studies are needed to assess the need and timing of booster vaccination to maintain long-term immunity.","Two recent studies look at the immunogenicity of the Hib for asplenic patients. The first study demonstrated increased antibody titers to Hib at 2, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months after immunization. Fifty of the 57 patients in the study (88%) maintained adequate antibody titers 3 years after immunization. No symptomatic infections were observed during the 3-year study period."
"What is the best way to diagnose polycystic ovarian syndrome
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a condition of unexplained hyperandrogenic chronic anovulation that most likely represents a heterogenous disorder. Its etiology remains unknown, and treatment is largely symptom based and empirical. Recent findings suggest PCOS has substantial metabolic sequelae, including risk of diabetes and possibly cardiovascular disease, and that primary treatment should focus on metabolic sequelae. The purpose of this document is to examine the best available evidence on the diagnosis and clinical management of PCOS.","A 2002 American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists guideline adopted the 1990 National Institutes of Health consensus panel criteria for diagnosing PCOS (ie, chronic anovulation and clinical or biochemical signs of hyperandrogenism, excluding other causes), and recommends that all patients have documentation of elevated testosterone levels; thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), prolactin, and 17-hydroxyprogesterone levels to exclude secondary causes of hyperandrogenism; and evaluation for metabolic abnormalities with a 2-hour glucose tolerance test and fasting lipid panel."
"How should you treat Candida vaginitis in patients on antibiotics
To test whether oral or vaginal lactobacillus can prevent vulvovaginitis after antibiotic treatment. Randomised, placebo controlled, double blind, factorial 2x2 trial. Fifty general practices and 16 pharmacies in Melbourne, Australia. Non-pregnant women aged 18-50 years who required a short course of oral antibiotics for a non-gynaecological infection: 278 were enrolled in the study, and results were available for 235. Lactobacillus preparations taken orally or vaginally, or both, from enrollment until four days after completion of their antibiotic course. Participants' reports of symptoms of post-antibiotic vulvovaginitis, with microbiological evidence of candidiasis provided by a self obtained vaginal swab. Overall, 55/235 (23% (95% confidence interval 18% to 29%)) women developed post-antibiotic vulvovaginitis. Compared with placebo, the odds ratio for developing post-antibiotic vulvovaginitis with oral lactobacillus was 1.06 (95% confidence interval 0.58 to 1.94) and with vaginal lactobacillus 1.38 (0.75 to 2.54). Compliance with antibiotics and interventions was high. The trial was terminated after the second interim analysis because of lack of effect of the interventions. Given the data at this time, the chances of detecting a significant reduction in vulvovaginitis with oral or vaginal lactobacillus treatment were less than 0.032 and 0.0006 respectively if the trial proceeded to full enrollment. The use of oral or vaginal forms of lactobacillus to prevent post-antibiotic vulvovaginitis is not supported by these results. Further research on this subject is unlikely to be fruitful, unless new understandings about the pathogenesis of post-antibiotic vulvovaginitis indicate a possible role for lactobacillus.","A recent randomized controlled trials of 278 women on short courses of antibiotics were randomized to oral lactobacilli or placebo and vaginal lactobacilli or placebo. The study was stopped early because there was no effect seen. Overall, 23% developed symptomatic vulvovaginitis."
"What is the initial work-up in the diagnosis of hypertension
The 356,222 men aged 35 to 57 years, who were free of a history of hospitalization for myocardial infarction, screened by the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial (MRFIT) in its recruitment effort, constitute the largest cohort with standardized serum cholesterol measurements and long-term mortality follow-up. For each five-year age group, the relationship between serum cholesterol and coronary heart disease (CHD) death rate was continuous, graded, and strong. For the entire group aged 35 to 57 years at entry, the age-adjusted risks of CHD death in cholesterol quintiles 2 through 5 (182 to 202, 203 to 220, 221 to 244, and greater than or equal to 245 mg/dL [4.71 to 5.22, 5.25 to 5.69, 5.72 to 6.31, and greater than or equal to 6.34 mmol/L]) relative to the lowest quintile were 1.29, 1.73, 2.21, and 3.42. Of all CHD deaths, 46% were estimated to be excess deaths attributable to serum cholesterol levels 180 mg/dL or greater (greater than or equal to 4.65 mmol/L), with almost half the excess deaths in serum cholesterol quintiles 2 through 4. The pattern of a continuous, graded, strong relationship between serum cholesterol and six-year age-adjusted CHD death rate prevailed for nonhypertensive nonsmokers, nonhypertensive smokers, hypertensive nonsmokers, and hypertensive smokers. These data of high precision show that the relationship between serum cholesterol and CHD is not a threshold one, with increased risk confined to the two highest quintiles, but rather is a continuously graded one that powerfully affects risk for the great majority of middle-aged American men.","A cohort study evaluating 356,222 men aged 35 to 57 years found a continuous, positive, graded correlation between plasma cholesterol levels and coronary risk."
"Do topical antibiotics improve wound healing
An open, randomized, human-model study was conducted to compare the effects of topical antibiotics, a wound protectant, and antiseptics on the rate of wound healing and bacterial growth using a modification of a method employing ammonium hydroxide-induced intradermal blisters inoculated with Staphylococcus aureus. Each volunteer in the study had six blister wounds (three per forearm) to which a triple antibiotic (neomycin, polymyxin B, bacitracin) ointment or one of four other test agents was applied twice a day. A control wound remained untreated. All wounds were covered with an occlusive dressing after treatment. The time to healing (100 percent epithelialization) was evaluated for each wound. Wounds were cultured for bacterial growth after two treatments. Contaminated blister wounds treated with the triple antibiotic ointment healed significantly faster (mean nine days) than wounds treated with any antiseptic and those receiving no treatment. Only the neomycin-polymyxin B-bacitracin combination effectively eliminated bacterial contamination of the wounds after two applications (within 16 to 24 hours after contamination with Staphylococcus aureus). The overall clinical appearance and healing rates of wounds treated with the triple antibiotic were ranked superior to all treatments (and no treatment) except the other antibiotic ointment in the study.","An open randomized trial with 48 volunteers compared the effects of Neosporin with several antiseptics (3% hydrogen peroxide, 1% povidone-iodine, 0.25% acetic acid, 0.5% sodium hydrochloride) and a wound protectant (Johnson & Johnson First Aid Cream without antimicrobial agent) on blister wounds (6 blisters per volunteer) intentionally contaminated with S aureus. Only Neosporin eliminated the infection after 2 applications (at 16 and 24 hours). Both the antibiotic ointment and the wound protectant led to faster wound healing by about 4 days compared with the antiseptics or no treatment."
"What are effective treatments for oppositional defiant behaviors in adolescents
Researchers and clinicians worldwide share concerns that many youngsters with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and/or disruptive behaviour disorders (DBDs) do not receive appropriate treatment despite availability of effective therapies. At the request of Johnson and Johnson (sponsor), 11 international experts in child and adolescent psychiatry were selected by Professor Stan Kutcher (chair) to address these concerns. This paper describes the experts' consensus conclusions, including treatment practice suggestions for physicians involved in the early treatment of youngsters with ADHD (or hyperkinetic disorder, in countries preferring this classification) and/or DBDs internationally: suggested first-line treatment for ADHD without comorbidity is psychostimulant medication aided by psychosocial intervention. For ADHD with comorbid conduct disorder (CD), psychosocial intervention combined with pharmacotherapy is suggested. For primary CD, suggested first-line treatment is psychosocial intervention, with pharmacotherapy considered as an 'add-on' when aggression/impulsivity is marked and persistent. Pharmacotherapy requires careful titration; full-day coverage is the suggested goal. Regular long-term follow-up is recommended.",Approximately half to two-thirds of adolescents with oppositional defiant disorder also have ADHD.
"Do calcium supplements prevent postmenopausal osteoporotic fractures
The use of calcium supplements slows bone loss in the forearm and has a beneficial effect on the axial bone density of women in late menopause whose calcium intake is less than 400 mg per day. However, the effect of a calcium supplement of 1000 mg per day on the axial bone density of postmenopausal women with higher calcium intakes is not known. We studied 122 normal women at least three years after they had reached menopause who had a mean dietary calcium intake of 750 mg per day. The women were randomly assigned to treatment with either calcium (1000 mg per day) or placebo for two years. The bone mineral density of the total body, lumbar spine, and proximal femur was measured every six months by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Serum and urine indexes of calcium metabolism were measured at base line and after 3, 12, and 24 months. The mean (+/- SE) rate of loss of total-body bone mineral density was reduced by 43 percent in the calcium group (-0.0055 +/- 0.0010 g per square centimeter per year) as compared with the placebo group (-0.0097 +/- 0.0010 g per square centimeter per year, P = 0.005). The rate of loss of bone mineral density was reduced by 35 percent in the legs (P = 0.02), and loss was eliminated in the trunk (P = 0.04). Calcium use was of significant benefit in the lumbar spine (P = 0.04), and in Ward's triangle the rate of loss was reduced by 67 percent (P = 0.04). Calcium supplementation had a similar effect whether dietary calcium intake was above or below the mean value for the group. Serum parathyroid hormone concentrations tended to be lower in the calcium group, as were urinary hydroxyproline excretion and serum alkaline phosphatase concentrations. Calcium supplementation significantly slowed axial and appendicular bone loss in normal post-menopausal women.","A randomized controlled trial of healthy women, postmenopausal for at least 3 years, showed that calcium supplementation at 1000 mg per day for 2 years decreased bone density loss in the hip and eliminated loss in the spine."
"What steps can reduce morbidity and mortality caused by hip fractures
We compared the mortality and outcome of 182 patients with proximal fractures of the femur after immediate and delayed surgical treatment. Seventy-nine patients were operated upon within six hours of the fracture (group 1) and 103 patients were operated upon after this period of time (group 2). At six months follow-up, group 1 had a significantly lower mortality rate. There was a good outcome in both groups with no differences in the outcome. Neither surgical nor anaesthetic factors appeared to have influenced mortality. The subdivision of groups revealed that patients operated on within 24 hours had a better outcome than those whose surgery was delayed. Although there may have been a bias, as patients were not randomly assigned to immediate or delayed surgical treatment, the data suggest that early stabilisation may be associated with a lower mortality rate. Even with pre-clinical delays of more than six hours early treatment should still be attempted, as better results seem to be achieved after 24 hours compared to a later time in our patients.",Some studies found decreased mortality with earlier surgical intervention.
"What are the indications for meningococcal vaccination
Neisseria meningitidis is the leading cause of bacterial meningitis in the United States and worldwide. A serogroup A/C/W-135/Y polysaccharide meningococcal vaccine has been licensed in the United States since 1981 but has not been used universally outside of the military. On 14 January 2005, a polysaccharide conjugate vaccine that covers meningococcal serogroups A, C, W-135, and Y was licensed in the United States for 11- to 55-year-olds and is now recommended for the routine immunization of adolescents and other high-risk groups. This review covers the changing epidemiology of meningococcal disease in the United States, issues related to vaccine prevention, and recommendations on the use of the new vaccine.","MCV4 is licensed for 11- to 55-year-olds and is the preferred vaccine in this age group, since it provides longer duration of immunity and reduces nasopharyngeal carriage."
"What is the best way to evaluate an acute traumatic knee injury
To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging of the knee in identifying traumatic intraarticular knee lesions. 300 patients with a clinical diagnosis of traumatic intraarticular knee lesions underwent prearthoscopic magnetic resonance imaging. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, likelihood ratio for a positive test, likelihood ratio for a negative test, and accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging were calculated relative to the findings during arthroscopy in the studied structures of the knee (medial meniscus, lateral meniscus, anterior cruciate ligament, posterior cruciate ligament, and articular cartilage). Magnetic resonance imaging produced the following results regarding detection of lesions: medial meniscus: sensitivity 97.5%, specificity 92.9%, positive predictive value 93.9%, positive negative value 97%, likelihood positive ratio 13.7, likelihood negative ratio 0.02, and accuracy 95.3%; lateral meniscus: sensitivity 91.9%, specificity 93.6%, positive predictive value 92.7%, positive negative value 92.9%, likelihood positive ratio 14.3, likelihood negative ratio 0.08, and accuracy 93.6%; anterior cruciate ligament: sensitivity 99.0%, specificity 95.9%, positive predictive value 91.9%, positive negative value 99.5%, likelihood positive ratio 21.5, likelihood negative ratio 0.01, and accuracy 96.6%; posterior cruciate ligament: sensitivity 100%, specificity 99%, positive predictive value 80.0%, positive negative value 100%, likelihood positive ratio 100, likelihood negative ratio 0.01, and accuracy 99.6%; articular cartilage: sensitivity 76.1%, specificity 94.9%, positive predictive value 94.7%, positive negative value 76.9%, likelihood positive ratio 14.9, likelihood negative ratio 0.25, and accuracy 84.6%. Magnetic resonance imaging is a satisfactory diagnostic tool for evaluating meniscal and ligamentous lesions of the knee, but it is unable to clearly identify articular cartilage lesions.","In a nonrandomized prospective study of adults receiving magnetic resonance imaging of the knee prior to arthroscopy, magnetic resonance imaging identified meniscal and ligamentous lesions of the knee satisfactorily."
"What are effective strategies for reducing the risk of steroid-induced osteoporosis
Corticosteroid-induced osteoporosis is a cause of morbidity in patients with chronic obstructive lung disease, asthma, and rheumatologic disorders. Corticosteroid treatment causes bone loss by a variety of complex mechanisms. It has been shown that bone mineral loss at the hip averages 14% in the first year after starting corticosteroid therapy. To review the efficacy of calcitonin (subcutaneous or nasal) for the treatment and prevention of corticosteroid-induced osteoporosis. We conducted a search of Medline, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register and Embase using the Cochrane Musculoskeletal Group search strategy for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) up to May 1998. We also searched bibliographic references and consulted content experts. Two independent reviewers selected RCTs which met predetermined inclusion criteria. Two reviewers independently extracted data using predetermined forms and assessed methodological quality of randomization, blinding and dropouts. For dichotomous outcomes, relative risks (RR) were calculated. For continuous data, weighted mean differences (WMD) of the percent change from baseline were calculated. We decided a priori to use random effects models for all outcomes, because of uncertainty about whether a consistent true effect exists in such different populations. Nine trials met the inclusion criteria, including 221 patients randomized to calcitonin and 220 to placebo. The median methodologic quality was two out of a maximum of five points. Calcitonin was more effective than placebo at preserving bone mass at the lumbar spine after six and 12 months of therapy with a WMD of 2.8% (95% CI: 1.4 to 4.3) and 3.2% (95% CI: 0.3 to 6.1). At 24 months, lumbar spine BMD was not statistically different between groups: WMD 4.5% (95% CI: -0.6 to 9.5)]. Bone density at the distal radius was also higher with calcitonin after six months of therapy, but bone density at the femoral neck was not different between placebo and calcitonin treated groups. The relative risk of fractures was not significantly different between calcitonin and placebo with a relative risk (RR) of 0.71 (95% CI: 0.26 to 1.89) for vertebral and 0.52 (95% CI: 0.14 to 1.96) for nonvertebral fractures. The subgroup analyses of methodological quality and duration of corticosteroid therapy were confounded. Trials of patients who had been taking steroids for greater than three months (which were of low methodologic quality) demonstrated a larger effect of calcitonin on spine bone density (about 6%) than prevention trials (about 1%). There was no consistent effect of different dosages (50-100 IU compared to 200-400 IU). However, subcutaneous calcitonin showed substantially greater prevention of bone loss. Withdrawals due to side effects were higher in the calcitonin-treated groups: RR 3.19 (95%CI: 0.66 to 15.47). Important side effects included nausea and facial flushing. Calcitonin appears to preserve bone mass in the first year of glucocorticoid therapy at the lumbar spine by about 3% compared to placebo, but not at the femoral neck. Our analysis suggests that the protective effect on bone mass may be greater for the treatment of patients who have been taking corticosteroids for more than three months. Efficacy of calcitonin for fracture prevention in steroid-induced osteoporosis remains to be established.","In a systematic review of 9 RCTs, including 441 patients, calcitonin preserved bone mass in the lumbar spine but not the femoral neck during the first year of steroid therapy. Lumbar spine bone mineral density values with calcitonin were significantly higher than with placebo at 6 and 12 months, but were similar at 24 months."
"What's the most practical way to rule out adrenal insufficiency
The cosyntropin stimulation test is the initial endocrine evaluation of suspected primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency. To critically review the utility of the cosyntropin stimulation test for evaluating adrenal insufficiency. The MEDLINE database was searched from 1966 to 2002 for all English-language papers related to the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency. Studies with fewer than 5 persons with primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency or with fewer than 10 persons as normal controls were excluded. For secondary adrenal insufficiency, only studies that stratified participants by integrated tests of adrenal function were included. Summary receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated from all studies that provided sensitivity and specificity data for 250-microg and 1-microg cosyntropin tests; these curves were then compared by using area under the curve (AUC) methods. All estimated values are given with 95% CIs. At a specificity of 95%, sensitivities were 97%, 57%, and 61% for summary ROC curves in tests for primary adrenal insufficiency (250-microg cosyntropin test), secondary adrenal insufficiency (250-microg cosyntropin test), and secondary adrenal insufficiency (1-microg cosyntropin test), respectively. The area under the curve for primary adrenal insufficiency was significantly greater than the AUC for secondary adrenal insufficiency for the high-dose cosyntropin test (P < 0.001), but AUCs for the 250-microg and 1-microg cosyntropin tests did not differ significantly (P > 0.5) for secondary adrenal insufficiency. At a specificity of 95%, summary ROC analysis for the 250-microg cosyntropin test yielded a positive likelihood ratio of 11.5 (95% CI, 8.7 to 14.2) and a negative likelihood ratio of 0.45 (CI, 0.30 to 0.60) for the diagnosis of secondary adrenal insufficiency. Cortisol response to cosyntropin varies considerably among healthy persons. The cosyntropin test performs well in patients with primary adrenal insufficiency, but the lower sensitivity in patients with secondary adrenal insufficiency necessitates use of tests involving stimulation of the hypothalamus if the pretest probability is sufficiently high. The operating characteristics of the 250-microg and 1-microg cosyntropin tests are similar.","Researchers conducting a meta-analysis of the contraction stress test in diagnosing both primary and secondary adrenal insufficiency searched MEDLINE for English-language studies from 1966 to 2002 and used summary receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves to combine the sensitivities and specificities from individual studies. Four studies of primary adrenal insufficiency showed a negative likelihood ratio of 0.026 for the 250 mcg CST. A negative contraction stress test would, therefore, significantly decrease the post-test probability of primary adrenal insufficiency and effectively rule out the condition."
"Prophylactic oxytocin: Before or after placental delivery
The objective of this study was to compare the administration of oxytocin at the beginning and end of the third stage of labor for the prevention of postpartum hemorrhage. Patients with documented singleton pregnancies were randomly assigned to two groups. The first received 10 units of oxytocin intramuscularly at delivery of the anterior shoulder of the fetus and an identical appearing placebo injection following delivery of the placenta. The second received the opposite medication sequence. The study was double blinded. Blood loss was measured by weighing all fluids collected, visual estimation, and serial blood counts. 27 women received oxytocin at the delivery of the fetal shoulder and 24 after the placenta. Oxytocin given after placenta delivery resulted in lower blood loss (345 vs. 400 ml, p = 0.28), lower collection bag weight (763 vs. 833 g, p = 0.55), lower change in HgB (-1.26 vs. -1.32 g, p = 0.86), lower DeltaHCT (-3.43 vs. -3.64%, p = 0.85), and a shorter third stage of labor duration (8.6 vs. 9.2 min, p = 0.75). The incidence of postpartum hemorrhage, defined as estimated blood loss >500 ml (0 vs. 14.8%) was significantly lowered with oxytocin following placental delivery (p = 0.049). In our study, postpartum hemorrhage was less frequent when oxytocin administration was delayed until after placenta delivery.","A double-blinded randomized controlled trials found that postpartum hemorrhage occurred significantly less often when oxytocin was delayed until after delivery of the placenta. The study comprised 51 patients; 27 received 10 units of oxytocin on delivery of the anterior shoulder and 24 received an identical dose after delivery of the placenta. The incidence of postpartum hemorrhage ≥500 mL was 0% when oxytocin was given after delivery of the placenta vs 14.8% when it was given on delivery of the anterior shoulder (P=.049). However, the study was limited by its size and potential inaccuracies in estimating blood loss."
"What is the appropriate diagnostic evaluation of fibroids
To determine the accuracy of transvaginal ultrasonography, sonohysterography and diagnostic hysteroscopy for the investigation of abnormal uterine bleeding in premenopausal women. Systematic review of common diagnostic imaging tests. Relevant papers were identified through electronic searching of MEDLINE (1980 to July 2001) and EMBASE (1980 to July 2001) and manual searching of a bibliography of primary and review articles. Studies were selected if accuracy of transvaginal ultrasonography, sonohysterography and diagnostic hysteroscopy was compared with a reference standard and included data that could be abstracted into a two-by-two table in order to calculate sensitivity and specificity. Quality assessment and data extraction were performed by at least two independent reviewers. Diagnostic accuracy was determined by calculating positive and negative likelihood ratios for all intrauterine pathologies, submucous fibroids and endometrial hyperplasia. Nineteen studies met the inclusion criteria. Statistically significant heterogeneity was present between the likelihood ratios for studies of transvaginal ultrasound. A positive test result with sonohysterography diagnosed submucous fibroids with a pooled likelihood ratio of 29.7 (17.8, 49.6). A positive test result with hysteroscopy diagnosed submucous fibroids with a pooled likelihood ratio of 29.4 (13.4, 65.3), and any intrauterine pathology with a pooled likelihood ratio of 7.7 (4.3, 13.7). A negative test result with hysteroscopy for diagnosing any intrauterine pathology had a pooled likelihood ratio of 0.07 (0.04, 0.15). Although there was considerable variability present between the studies, all three diagnostic tests were moderately accurate in detecting intrauterine pathology. However, sonohysterography and hysteroscopy performed better than transvaginal ultrasound in detecting submucous fibroids.","In a systematic review of 4 studies, hysteroscopy had a pooled LR+ of 29.4 for diagnosing fibroids. Due to study heterogeneity, a pooled LR- could not be calculated."
"Which nondrug alternatives can help with insomnia
Although four meta-analytic reviews support the efficacy of pharmacotherapy and behavior therapy for the treatment of insomnia, no meta-analysis has evaluated whether these treatment modalities yield comparable outcomes during acute treatment. The authors conducted a quantitative review of the literature on the outcome of the two treatments to compare the short-term efficacy of pharmacotherapy and behavioral therapy in primary insomnia. They identified studies from 1966 through 2000 using MEDLINE, psycINFO, and bibliographies. Investigations were limited to studies using prospective measures and within-subject designs to assess the efficacy of benzodiazepines or benzodiazepine receptor agonists or behavioral treatments for primary insomnia. Benzodiazepine receptor agonists included zolpidem, zopiclone, and zaleplon. Behavioral treatments included stimulus control and sleep restriction therapies. Twenty-one studies summarizing outcomes for 470 subjects met inclusion criteria. Weighted effect sizes for subjective measures of sleep latency, number of awakenings, wake time after sleep onset, total sleep time, and sleep quality before and after treatment were moderate to large. There were no differences in magnitude between pharmacological and behavioral treatments in any measures except latency to sleep onset. Behavior therapy resulted in a greater reduction in sleep latency than pharmacotherapy. Overall, behavior therapy and pharmacotherapy produce similar short-term treatment outcomes in primary insomnia.","A meta-analysis of 21 studies validated behavior therapy, and revealed cognitive-behavioral treatment reduced sleep onset latency by an additional 8.8 minutes over medication (95% confidence interval, 0.17-1.04 minutes)."
"How safe is vaginal birth after cesarean section for the mother and fetus
This study was undertaken to assess the safety of trial of labor after previous cesarean delivery. Retrospective cohort study of 308,755 Canadian women with previous cesarean delivery between 1988 and 2000. Occurrences of in-hospital maternal death, uterine rupture, and other severe maternal morbidity were compared between women with a trial of labor and those with an elective cesarean section. Rates of uterine rupture (0.65%), transfusion (0.19%), and hysterectomy (0.10%) were significantly higher in the trial-of-labor group. Maternal in-hospital death rate, however, was lower in the trial-of-labor group (1.6 per 100,000) than in the elective cesarean section group (5.6 per 100,000). The association between trial of labor and uterine rupture was stronger in low volume (<500) than in high volume (> or =500 births per year) obstetric units. Trial of labor is associated with increased risk of uterine rupture, but elective cesarean section may increase the risk of maternal death.","The effect of vaginal birth after cesarean on neonatal morbidity and mortality is unclear. A retrospective Canadian cohort trial of 308,755 women also demonstrated an association of vaginal birth after cesarean with uterine rupture(0.65% of trial-of-labor cases; OR=2.38; 95% CI, 2.12-2.67), and a trend towards higher maternal mortality in the cesarean group (1.6 per 100,000 for vaginal birth after cesarean vs 5.6 per 100,000 for planned cesarean; OR=0.32; 95% CI, 0.07-1.47)."
"Alcoholic liver disease: Is acetaminophen safe
Retrospective reports suggest that therapeutic doses of acetaminophen may be associated with fulminant hepatic failure and death in alcoholic patients. Millions of patients use acetaminophen; the prevalence of alcoholism in the United States is 5% to 10%. To determine if hepatic injury was associated with maximal therapeutic dosing of acetaminophen to chronic alcohol abuse patients immediately following cessation of alcohol intake (the presumed time of maximal vulnerability). Patients entering an alcohol detoxification center were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Exclusion criteria were baseline values of aspartate or alanine aminotransferase greater than 120 U/L, international normalized ratio greater than 1.5, serum acetaminophen level greater than 20 mg/L, or a history of ingesting more than 4 g/d of acetaminophen. Acetaminophen, 1000 mg, or placebo was administered orally 4 times daily for 2 consecutive days and liver test results were monitored for 2 more days. Acetaminophen was not administered until the alcohol had been eliminated. There were 102 patients in the acetaminophen-treated group and 99 patients in the placebo-treated (control) group. Demographic data, alcohol history, and baseline blood test results were similar in both groups. The mean (SD) aspartate aminotransferase level on day 4 was 38.0 +/- 26.7 U/L in the acetaminophen-treated group and 37.5 +/- 27.6 U/L in the placebo-treated group. There were 4 patients in the acetaminophen-treated group and 5 in the placebo-treated group who developed an increase in their serum aspartate aminotransferase level to greater than 120 U/L; it did not exceed 200 U/L in any patient. The mean (SD) international normalized ratio on day 4 was 0.96 +/- 0.09 in the acetaminophen-treated group and 0.98 +/- 0.11 in the placebo-treated group. Repeated administration of the maximum recommended daily doses of acetaminophen to long-term alcoholic patients was not associated with evidence of liver injury.","In a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study, 102 alcoholic patients were given 4 g of acetaminophen daily for 2 days. Liver enzymes were monitored for an additional 2 days. There was no elevation in aminotransferases when compared with the control group of 99 patients who received the placebo. The mean aspartate transaminase level on day 4 was 38.0±26.7 U/L in the treatment group and 37.5±27.6 in the placebo group. In this brief study, there was no increase in liver toxicity among alcoholic patients given the maximal therapeutic dose of acetaminophen."
"What is the best treatment for infants with colic
To conduct a systematic review of rigorously evaluated treatments for infant colic. Online bibliographic databases were searched for the term ""colic"" in articles classified as clinical trials or randomized controlled trials and conducted in infants. Reference lists from review articles, meta-analyses, and the selected articles were also reviewed for potential studies. The abstracts or full-text articles of 57 relevant studies were examined, of which 22 met the selection criteria. The methodology and findings of all retrieved articles were critically evaluated. Data were extracted from each article regarding study methods, intervention studied, outcomes measured, and results. Four of the interventions studied had data of adequate quality and statistically significant numbers needed to treat (NNT): hypoallergenic diet (NNT = 6), soy formula (NNT = 2), reduced stimulation (NNT = 2), and herbal tea (NNT = 3). There are some effective therapies for infant colic, but additional rigorous studies of existing and alternative therapies are needed.","A systematic review followed a similar high-quality search strategy and identified 22 articles, and reported a number needed to treat (NNT) of 6 for the 2 hypoallergenic formula studies identified in the previous review. Because of concern regarding the quality of the behavioral studies involving infants with colic, the authors of this second review only included 1 small (42 patients) trial of decreased stimulation, which resulted in a relative risk (RR) of 1.87 (95% CI, 1.04-3.34) and a number needed to treat of 2. There was some inconclusive evidence to suggest benefit to dietary adjustment for breastfeeding mothers (specifically, the avoidance of cow's milk and other potential allergens like nuts, eggs, and wheat)."
"What blood tests help diagnose celiac disease
Clinicians are increasingly utilizing noninvasive serologic tests for the diagnosis and screening of celiac disease (CD). The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review of the diagnostic performance of serologic tests for the diagnosis and screening of CD. Standard systematic review methodology was used. A literature search was conducted in MEDLINE (1966 to October 2003) and EMBASE (1974 to December 2003) databases. A weighted mean of the sensitivity and specificity along with 95% confidence intervals and summary receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were calculated. The pooled specificity of endomyseal antibody (EMA)-monkey esophagus (ME) or EMA-human umbilical cord (HU) was close to 100% in adults and children. The pooled specificity of transglutaminase antibody (tTG)-guinea pig (GP) and tTG-human recombinant (HR) were between 95% and 99%. IgA-EMA-ME demonstrated sensitivities of 96% and 97% in children and adults, respectively. EMA-HU demonstrated a similar sensitivity of 97% in children but 90% in adults. The pooled sensitivity of tTG-GP in adults and children was 90% and 93%, respectively. The sensitivity of tTG-HR was 98% and 96%, respectively. The performance of antigliadin antibody was inferior to that of EMA and tTG. EMA and tTG offer high sensitivity and specificity. The sensitivity of these tests appears to be lower than reported when milder histologic grades are used to define CD (below 90%). If true, the nearly perfect negative predictive value of these tests would drop. The positive predictive value of these tests is likely lower than reported when the tests are applied in low-prevalence populations.","In a systematic review, there was no statistically significant difference between IgA EMA and IgA tTG-both had sensitivities greater than 90% and specificities greater than 95%. IgA antigliadin antibodies did not perform as well (sensitivity 80%-90%, specificity 85%-95%). IgG tTG and IgG EMA had specificities of 95% but sensitivities of only 40%."
"Does screening for diabetes in at-risk patients improve long-term outcomes
Type 2 diabetes mellitus is associated with a heavy burden of suffering. Screening for diabetes is controversial. To examine the evidence that screening and earlier treatment are effective in reducing morbidity and mortality associated with diabetes. MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, reviews, and experts, all of which addressed key questions about screening. Studies that provided information about the existence and length of an asymptomatic phase of diabetes; studies that addressed the accuracy and reliability of screening tests; and randomized, controlled trials with health outcomes for various treatment strategies were selected. Two reviewers abstracted relevant information using standardized abstraction forms and graded articles according to U.S. Preventive Services Task Force criteria. No randomized, controlled trial of screening for diabetes has been performed. Type 2 diabetes mellitus includes an asymptomatic preclinical phase; the length of this phase is unknown. Screening tests can detect diabetes in its preclinical phase. Over the 10 to 15 years after clinical diagnosis, tight glycemic control probably reduces the risk for blindness and end-stage renal disease, and aggressive control of hypertension, lipid therapy, and aspirin use reduce cardiovascular events. The magnitude of the benefit is larger for cardiovascular risk reduction than for tight glycemic control. The additional benefit of starting these treatments in the preclinical phase, after detection by screening, is uncertain but is probably also greater for cardiovascular risk reduction. The interventions that are most clearly beneficial during the preclinical phase are those that affect the risk for cardiovascular disease. The magnitude of additional benefit of initiating tight glycemic control during the preclinical phase is uncertain but probably small.","No randomized trials have tested whether screening provides any benefits. In a thorough systematic review using us preventive services task force methodologies, several potential postscreening interventions were evaluated. While tight glycemic control reduces progression of albuminuria and retinopathy, it is unclear how large the long-term clinical benefit would be, or at what cost. Reasonable evidence supports more aggressive control of blood pressure for patients with diabetes to reduce adverse cardiovascular outcomes. It is important to note that the data for these interventions (aggressive blood sugar and blood pressure control) were derived in studies of patients with established diabetes; no studies have tested these interventions for patients who had early diagnosis by screening."
"When should acute nonvenereal conjunctivitis be treated with topical antibiotics
We studied 102 children aged 1 month to 18 years in a randomized, double-blind trial designed to determine both the natural history of bacterial conjunctivitis and whether topical antibiotic therapy is beneficial. Affected eyes were treated four times a day for 7 days with drug (polymyxin-bacitracin ophthalmic ointment) or placebo. Eighty-four patients had proved bacterial conjunctivitis (Haemophilus influenzae 61, Streptococcus pneumoniae 22, both one); 66 of these received only topical therapy. By 3 to 5 days, 21 of 34 (62%) patients receiving topical antibiotic were clinically cured, whereas only nine of 32 (28%) patients given placebo were cured (P less than 0.02). By 8 to 10 days, 31 (91%) of the patients given antibiotic and 23 (72%) of the placebo group were cured (P = NS). The bacterial pathogen was eradicated by day 3 to 5 in 71% and by day 8 to 10 in 79% of patients given antibiotic, compared to 19% and 31% of the placebo group (P less than 0.001). Acute bacterial conjunctivitis is a self-limited disease, but topical antibiotic therapy with polymyxin-bacitracin shortens the duration of clinical disease and enhances eradication of the causative organism from the conjunctiva.",One review reports that 25% of children with Haemophilus influenzae conjunctivitis develop otitis media.
"What's the best treatment for sebaceous cysts
Punch incision has been introduced as an alternative method to surgical excision for troublesome epidermal inclusion cysts. To date, there is no randomized study directly comparing the long-term results of these two methods. To compare the surgical outcomes of these two procedures and to identify the characteristics of a lesion most suitable for the punch incision technique. In a 16-month period, 60 patients with noninfected epidermal inclusion cysts were randomly treated with either punch incision or elliptical excision. Demographic data, size, and location of lesion, length of wound, operative time, complications, recurrence, and patient satisfaction were compared statistically. The mean lengths of the wounds in the punch incision and elliptical excision groups were 0.73 and 2.34 cm, respectively (p<.001). Mean operative time was significantly shorter in the punch group (12.7 minutes) as compared with the surgical group (21.6 minutes) (p<.001). No complication occurred in the punch incision group. There was no significant difference in the recurrence rate. Punch incision produces a superior cosmetic result while keeping a low recurrence rate of cysts. Epidermal inclusion cysts measuring 1 to 2 cm that are located on the face or in an area of cosmetic concern are best treated with punch incision.","Only 1 small (n=60) randomized study compared traditional wide excision with punch biopsy. They found punch biopsy to be less time-consuming and to offer superior cosmetic results. However, cysts larger than 2 cm took longer with the punch biopsy technique. Only a single dermatologist performed all of the surgeries, which could introduce bias. There was no mention of blinding of the researcher that subsequently measured the wounds. Of the 31 patients randomized to the punch biopsy technique, there was 1 recurrence in the 16 months of follow-up compared with none in the wide excision arm. This study excluded patients with infected, inflamed, or recurrent cysts."
"Do testosterone injections increase libido for elderly hypogonadal patients
Sexual desire was studied in 22 post-menopausal women (absence of menses for at least 12 mth) without complaints of sexual dysfunction, not receiving estrogen replacement therapy, and in good physical health. Psychosexual evaluation, medical history, physical and pelvic examinations, and blood samples for the determination of estradiol, androstenedione, FSH and LH were obtained. In addition, the effects of a formal exercise program on sexual desire was investigated. It was found that approximately 50% of the women in this study experienced no decline in sexual interests with menopause, and less than 20% reported a significant decrease. Results indicated a positive relationship between desire and a measure of marital adjustments which women with loss of sex desire had on the Locke-Wallace Marital Adjustment Test. There was no correlation between gonadotropins and loss of sexual desire.",Up to 50% of postmenopausal women experience sexual dysfunction.
"What is the best diagnostic approach to postmenopausal vaginal bleeding in women taking hormone replacement therapy
Postmenopausal women should undergo endometrial assessment when bleeding occurs in the absence of replacement hormone therapy, after a 1-year regimen of continuous-combined hormone replacement therapy, or at an unexpected time during cyclic replacement therapy. Endometrial assessment can be accomplished by endometrial biopsy, transvaginal ultrasonography, or hysteroscopy. Dilation and curettage should be reserved for those rare cases when the other methods are infeasible. Each method of assessment has advantages and disadvantages, and the choice of method should be made accordingly.","Abnormal sonograms or persistent unexpected bleeding after a normal sonogram requires further evaluation. Endometrial biopsy is a straightforward office procedure, and is as sensitive as dilatation and curretage."
"What gastrointestinal stress ulcer prophylaxis should we provide hospitalized patients
Critically ill patients who require mechanical ventilation are at increased risk for gastrointestinal bleeding from stress ulcers. There are conflicting data on the effect of histamine H2-receptor antagonists and the cytoprotective agent sucralfate on rates of gastrointestinal bleeding, ventilator-associated pneumonia, and mortality. In a multicenter, randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled trial, we compared sucralfate with the H2-receptor antagonist ranitidine for the prevention of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in 1200 patients who required mechanical ventilation. Patients received either nasogastric sucralfate suspension (1 g every six hours) and an intravenous placebo or intravenous ranitidine (50 mg every eight hours) and a nasogastric placebo. The patients in the two groups had similar base-line characteristics. Clinically important gastrointestinal bleeding developed in 10 of 596 (1.7 percent) of the patients receiving ranitidine, as compared with 23 of 604 (3.8 percent) of those receiving sucralfate (relative risk, 0.44; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.21 to 0.92; P=0.02). In the ranitidine group, 114 of 596 patients (19.1 percent) had ventilator-associated pneumonia, as compared with 98 of 604 (16.2 percent) in the sucralfate group (relative risk, 1.18; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.92 to 1.51; P=0.19). There was no significant difference between the groups in mortality in the intensive care unit (ICU) (23.5 percent in the ranitidine group and 22.9 percent in the sucralfate group) or the duration of the stay in the ICU (median, nine days in both groups). Among critically ill patients requiring mechanical ventilation, those receiving ranitidine had a significantly lower rate of clinically important gastrointestinal bleeding than those treated with sucralfate. There were no significant differences in the rates of ventilator-associated pneumonia, the duration of the stay in the ICU, or mortality.","Some studies suggest that pharmacologic prophylaxis may increase the incidence of aspiration pneumonia in ventilator-dependent patients. The largest randomized trial addressing this issue (N=1200) found no significant difference between H2RAs and sucralfate in ventilator-associated pneumonia. Improved ICU management, such as frequent suctioning, upright positioning, and use of enteral nutrition may help prevent nosocomial pneumonia due to aspiration."
"Are breast self-exams or clinical exams effective for screening breast cancer
Screening for breast cancer with mammography in women aged 50 years or more has been shown to reduce mortality from breast cancer. However, the extent to which mammography contributes to the reduction of mortality in women who also undergo physical examination of the breasts is not known. This study was designed to compare breast cancer mortality following annual screening consisting of two-view mammography and physical examination of the breasts with mortality following annual screening by physical examination only. Breast self-examination was taught to all participants. This trial randomly and individually assigned 39 405 women aged 50-59 years, recruited from January 1980 through March 1985, to one of the study arms. The women were followed by record linkage with the Canadian National Cancer Registry and National Mortality Database to December 31, 1993, and by active follow-up of breast cancer patients to June 30, 1996. Randomization achieved virtually equal distribution of demographic and breast cancer risk variables. At the first annual screen, 21% of the cancers found by mammography alone (in the mammography plus physical examination group) were 20 mm or more in size compared with 46% of those found by physical examination in the mammography plus physical examination group and 56% in the physical examination-only group. The corresponding percentages for screens 2-5 were 10%, 42%, and 50%, respectively. Screening detected 267 invasive breast cancers in the mammography plus physical examination group compared with 148 in the physical examination-only group. By December 31, 1993, 622 invasive and 71 in situ breast carcinomas were ascertained in the mammography plus physical examination group, and 610 and 16 were ascertained in the physical examination-only group. At 13-year follow-up, with 107 and 105 deaths from breast cancer in the respective groups, the cumulative rate ratio was 1.02 (95% confidence interval = 0.78-1.33). In women aged 50-59 years, the addition of annual mammography screening to physical examination has no impact on breast cancer mortality.","No trials comparing screening clinical breast examinations alone to no screening have been reported, but good indirect evidence of efficacy comes from the results of the Canadian National Breast Screening Study-2 (CNBSS-2). A total of 39,405 women aged 50 to 59 years were randomized to screening with clinical exams plus mammography or clinical exams alone."
"What could be behind your elderly patient's subjective memory complaints
To study whether subjective memory deterioration is associated with future dementia in older people. A population-based prospective cohort study begun in 1994 with biennial follow-up interviews. Community-based members of Group Health Cooperative, a large health maintenance organization in the Seattle area. A sample of 1,883 subjects, dementia free, aged 65 and older, who scored 91 or higher on the 100-point Cognitive Ability Screening Instrument (CASI) at study entry. Subjective memory was assessed by asking whether memory had changed on 5-point Likert scales (e.g., 1=definitely improved, 3=no change, 5=definitely deteriorated) with regard to five items: remembering names, faces, friends, and appointments and judging the time. The items were summed for a possible total score ranging from 5 to 25. Subjective memory deterioration was defined as present if the total score was 20 or above. Cognitive performance was measured using the CASI. Incident dementia cases were identified using Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition criteria. Of 1,883 subjects, 126 developed dementia during 5 years of follow-up. Subjective memory deterioration was associated with cognitive decline and incident dementia. Age modified the association between subjective memory deterioration and future dementia. For persons reporting subjective memory deterioration at the ages of 70, 75, and 80, the hazard ratios of developing dementia were 6.0 (95% confidence interval (CI)=2.1-18), 3.2 (95% CI=1.6-6.2) and 1.6 (95% CI=0.86-3.1), respectively. Subjective memory deterioration was found to precede the development of dementia in older people with normal cognitive screening results. These findings suggest that a high level of subjective memory deterioration in persons with normal objective cognitive function may identify a subset of individuals at greater risk for developing dementia.","A study of 1883 patients with normal baseline short-cognitive test results found that those with subjective memory complaints had a higher incidence of dementia. At 5-year follow-up, 15% of patients with baseline subjective memory complaints had developed dementia compared to only 6% of those without such complaints (odds ratio=2.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.45-4.98)."
"Can infants/toddlers get enough fluoride through brushing
Fluoride toothpastes have been widely used for over three decades and remain a benchmark intervention for the prevention of dental caries. To determine the effectiveness and safety of fluoride toothpastes in the prevention of caries in children and to examine factors potentially modifying their effect. We searched the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (May 2000), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2000), MEDLINE (1966 to January 2000), plus several other databases. We handsearched journals, reference lists of articles and contacted selected authors and manufacturers. Randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials with blind outcome assessment, comparing fluoride toothpaste with placebo in children up to 16 years during at least one year. The main outcome was caries increment measured by the change in decayed, missing and filled tooth surfaces (D(M)FS). Inclusion decisions, quality assessment and data extraction were duplicated in a random sample of one third of studies, and consensus achieved by discussion or a third party. Authors were contacted for missing data. The primary measure of effect was the prevented fraction (PF) that is the difference in caries increments between the treatment and control groups expressed as a percentage of the increment in the control group. Random effects meta-analyses were performed where data could be pooled. Potential sources of heterogeneity were examined in random effects meta-regression analyses. Seventy-four studies were included. For the 70 that contributed data for meta-analysis (involving 42,300 children) the D(M)FS pooled PF was 24% (95% confidence interval (CI), 21 to 28%; p<0.0001). This means that 1.6 children need to brush with a fluoride toothpaste (rather than a non-fluoride toothpaste) over three years to prevent one D(M)FS in populations with caries increment of 2.6 D(M)FS per year. In populations with caries increment of 1.1 D(M)FS per year, 3.7 children will need to use a fluoride toothpaste for three years to avoid one D(M)FS. There was clear heterogeneity, confirmed statistically (p<0.0001). The effect of fluoride toothpaste increased with higher baseline levels of D(M)FS, higher fluoride concentration, higher frequency of use, and supervised brushing, but was not influenced by exposure to water fluoridation. There is little information concerning the deciduous dentition or adverse effects (fluorosis). Supported by more than half a century of research, the benefits of fluoride toothpastes are firmly established. Taken together, the trials are of relatively high quality, and provide clear evidence that fluoride toothpastes are efficacious in preventing caries.","Depending on the prevalence of caries in the population, between 1.6 and 3.7 children need to use a fluoride toothpaste to prevent 1 decayed, missing, or filled tooth."
"What's the best treatment for CIN 2 or 3
To assess the effectiveness of cone biopsy, cryotherapy, laser ablation and the loop electrosurgical procedure in the treatment of squamous intraepithelial lesions. Systematic review of randomized controlled trials in subjects who underwent treatment of low- and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions with these modalities. Main outcome measures included the following: percent resolution and persistence of a lesion and notable complications for each procedure. Pooled rates of resolution for low-grade, high-grade, or combined squamous intraepithelial lesions were similar across the different treatment modalities (range 85.2-94.7%), with substantial overlap among the 95% confidence intervals. Significant hemorrhage occurred most frequently in subjects who received cone biopsy (4.6%) (95% CI: 2.15, 6.99), followed by laser ablation (1.75%) (95% CI: 0.70, 2.81), and LEEP (1.35%) (95% CI: 0.24, 2.47). No hemorrhages were reported among subjects who received cryotherapy. Study sample sizes were relatively small. There were no reported cases of progression to invasive cancer, but duration of follow-up (median follow-up time for all eligible studies = 12 months) was not sufficient to evaluate long-term outcomes. There were no substantive differences in outcomes regarding persistence and resolution in the treatment of squamous intraepithelial lesions for subjects receiving cone biopsy, cryotherapy, laser ablation, or LEEP.","A systematic review of 21 controlled trials comparing treatments for CIN 2 or 3 found a similar efficacy of all the modalities, including cone biopsy, cryotherapy, laser ablation, and LEEP. However, it also found a trend toward a higher rate of significant hemorrhage among women who received cone biopsies compared with women who received either laser ablation or LEEP."
"What is the best way to treat tinea cruris
Data from 104 subjects with tinea cruris or tinea corporis were evaluated in this double-blind, randomized study. The subjects applied naftifine cream 1% or econazole nitrate cream 1% to affected areas twice daily for 4 weeks. After 1 week of treatment naftifine had an overall cure rate of 19% compared with 4% for econazole (p = 0.03). A difference in favor of naftifine, although not statistically significant after the first week, persisted throughout treatment. Two weeks after the end of treatment both medications had overall cure rates of approximately 80%. Three percent of the naftifine-treated subjects had side effects compared with 13% of the econazole-treated subjects. In two subjects using econazole, the side effects were severe enough to warrant discontinuation of treatment.","In a 4-week study involving 104 patients, naftifine 1% cream (Naftin) was compared with econazole 1% cream (Spectazole) (both applied twice daily). At the end of the study, naftifine 1% cream had a higher (but not statistically significant) mycological and clinical cure rate of 78% compared with 68% with econazole 1% cream."
"Is combining angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors and ARBs helpful or harmful
Actions of angiotensin II may contribute to the progression of heart failure despite treatment with currently recommended drugs. We therefore evaluated the long-term effects of the addition of the angiotensin-receptor blocker valsartan to standard therapy for heart failure. A total of 5010 patients with heart failure of New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II, III, or IV were randomly assigned to receive 160 mg of valsartan or placebo twice daily. The primary outcomes were mortality and the combined end point of mortality and morbidity, defined as the incidence of cardiac arrest with resuscitation, hospitalization for heart failure, or receipt of intravenous inotropic or vasodilator therapy for at least four hours. Overall mortality was similar in the two groups. The incidence of the combined end point, however, was 13.2 percent lower with valsartan than with placebo (relative risk, 0.87; 97.5 percent confidence interval, 0.77 to 0.97; P=0.009), predominantly because of a lower number of patients hospitalized for heart failure; 455 (18.2 percent) in the placebo group and 346 (13.8 percent) in the valsartan group (P<0.001). Treatment with valsartan also resulted in significant improvements in NYHA class, ejection fraction, signs and symptoms of heart failure, and quality of life as compared with placebo (P<0.01). In a post hoc analysis of the combined end point and mortality in subgroups defined according to base-line treatment with angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or beta-blockers, valsartan had a favorable effect in patients receiving neither or one of these types of drugs but an adverse effect in patients receiving both types of drugs. Valsartan significantly reduces the combined end point of mortality and morbidity and improves clinical signs and symptoms in patients with heart failure, when added to prescribed therapy. However, the post hoc observation of an adverse effect on mortality and morbidity in the subgroup receiving valsartan, an ACE inhibitor, and a beta-blocker raises concern about the potential safety of this specific combination.","In ValHeFT, 5010 patients with systolic dysfunction were randomized to the ARB valsartan or placebo in addition to background therapy, which included an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor in 93% of subjects. The primary endpoints were mortality and combined mortality and morbidity. An increase in mortality was found among patients on the triple therapy combination of valsartan, an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor, and a beta-blocker (relative risk [RR]=1.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1-1.9). Among those not on beta-blockers, adding valsartan to baseline therapy of an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor resulted in a modest improvement in the combined endpoint (RR=0.8; 95% CI, 0.7-0.9), but no change in mortality alone was found."
"What's the best test for HSV-2 after exposure
Most current enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) differentiate inadequately between types 1 and 2 herpes simplex virus (HSV) antibodies since significant cross-reactivity exists. We compared 4 IgG type-specific EIAs using a Western blot assay for resolution of discrepant results. The Diamedix had sensitivities of 100% for types 1 and 2 but specificities of only 71% and 61%, respectively. The cross-reactivity rate was 82% in positive samples tested. For HSV types 1 and 2, the Zeus sensitivities were 92% and 98%, respectively; specificities were 72% and 79%, respectively; the cross-reactivity rate was 54%. For HSV types 1 and 2, the Wampole sensitivities were 98% and 95%, respectively; specificities were 68% and 85%, respectively; the cross-reactivity rate was 47%. For HSV types 1 and 2, the Meridian sensitivities were 98% and 90%, respectively; specificities were 96% and 100%, respectively; no cross-reactivity was found between positive samples tested. While the Diamedix, Zeus, and Wampole assays showed good sensitivity, they lacked type specificity. The Meridian EIA offers the highest specificity along with no observed cross-reactivity. This EIA may be an easier, reliable alternative to Western blot for the determination of HSV type-specific antibodies.","Using the Western blot technique as the gold standard, a total of 158 serum samples from patients with either HSV-1 or HSV-2 infection-without mention of symptomatology-were used to compare the performance of several commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay assays. The glycoprotein G and non-glycoprotein G enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay tests were both found to have sensitivities >90%, but the non-glycoprotein G enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay tests had specificities under 90%. In 47% to 82% of the samples tested with non-glycoprotein G ELISA, there was cross-reactivity between HSV-1 and HSV-2 antibodies."
"For those intolerant to angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors and ARBs, what is the best therapy for reducing the risk of diabetic nephropathy
Diabetes mellitus is a strong risk factor for cardiovascular and renal disease. We investigated whether the angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitor ramipril can lower these risks in patients with diabetes. 3577 people with diabetes included in the Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation study, aged 55 years or older, who had a previous cardiovascular event or at least one other cardiovascular risk factor, no clinical proteinuria, heart failure, or low ejection fraction, and who were not taking ACE inhibitors, were randomly assigned ramipril (10 mg/day) or placebo, and vitamin E or placebo, according to a two-by-two factorial design. The combined primary outcome was myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular death. Overt nephropathy was a main outcome in a substudy. The study was stopped 6 months early (after 4.5 years) by the independent data safety and monitoring board because of a consistent benefit of ramipril compared with placebo. Ramipril lowered the risk of the combined primary outcome by 25% (95% CI 12-36, p=0.0004), myocardial infarction by 22% (6-36), stroke by 33% (10-50), cardiovascular death by 37% (21-51), total mortality by 24% (8-37), revascularisation by 17% (2-30), and overt nephropathy by 24% (3-40, p=0.027). After adjustment for the changes in systolic (2.4 mm Hg) and diastolic (1.0 mm Hg) blood pressures, ramipril still lowered the risk of the combined primary outcome by 25% (12-36, p=0.0004). Ramipril was beneficial for cardiovascular events and overt nephropathy in people with diabetes. The cardiovascular benefit was greater than that attributable to the decrease in blood pressure. This treatment represents a vasculoprotective and renoprotective effect for people with diabetes.","In hypertensive and normotensive patients with type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria, angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors have been well studied and found to reduce the risk of mortality, major cardiovascular events, and slow the progression to overt nephropathy, in patients with diabetes and at least 1 other risk factor."
"When should we screen children for hyperlipidemia
PURPOSE: Both the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) and the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP ATP III) have issued recommendations on screening for dyslipidemia in adults. To guide the USPSTF in updating its 2001 recommendations, we reviewed evidence relevant to discrepancies between these recommendations. DATA SOURCES: A 2001 evidence review prepared for the USPSTF, supplemented by searches of the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and reference lists of recent systematic reviews. STUDY SELECTION: Randomized controlled trials and observational studies published between December 1999 and February 2005 that addressed screening in younger patients not at high risk; use of triglyceride levels in an initial screening panel; optimal screening intervals; selection of patients for treatment; and harms of drug therapy. DATA EXTRACTION: We abstracted data on the design, results, and quality of each included trial. We used standard USPSTF methods to rate the internal validity of trials and epidemiologic studies. DATA SYNTHESIS: New evidence relevant to discrepancies between USPSTF and ATP III recommendations was summarized in the context of earlier evidence. LIMITATIONS: This document should be read in conjunction with the full systematic evidence review conducted for the USPSTF in 2001, the final report of ATP III, and the 2004 ATP III update. CONCLUSIONS: There is no new evidence relevant to screening younger adults or to appropriate screening intervals. Evidence is conflicting regarding the additional contribution of a serum triglyceride level to the identification of individuals at short-term risk for coronary heart disease events. The balance of benefits and harms is clearly in favor of statin therapy among individuals enrolled in some, but not all, randomized trials of primary prevention. The long-term harms of statin therapy are unknown.",Screening for hyperlipidemia using total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol is recommended for adults after the age of 35 years for men and 45 years for women. Younger adults (men aged 20-35 and women aged 20-45) should be screened for lipid disorders if they have other risk factors for CVD.
"What effect do inhaled steroids have on delaying the progression of COPD
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) results from a progressive decline in lung function, which is thought to be the consequence of airway inflammation. We hypothesized that antiinflammatory therapy with inhaled corticosteroids would slow this decline. We enrolled 1116 persons with COPD whose forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) was 30 to 90 percent of the predicted value in a 10-center, placebo-controlled, randomized trial of inhaled triamcinolone acetonide administered at a dose of 600 microg twice daily. The primary outcome measure was the rate of decline in FEV1 after the administration of a bronchodilator. The secondary outcome measures included respiratory symptoms, use of health care services, and airway reactivity. In a substudy of 412 participants, we measured bone density in the lumbar spine and femur at base line and one and three years after the beginning of treatment. The mean duration of follow-up was 40 months. The rate of decline in the FEV1 after bronchodilator use was similar in the 559 participants in the triamcinolone group and the 557 participants in the placebo group (44.2+/-2.9 vs. 47.0+/-3.0 ml per year, P= 0.50). Members of the triamcinolone group had fewer respiratory symptoms during the course of the study (21.1 per 100 person-years vs. 28.2 per 100 person-years, P=0.005) and had fewer visits to a physician because of a respiratory illness (1.2 per 100 person-years vs. 2.1 per 100 person-years, P=0.03). Those taking triamcinolone also had lower airway reactivity in response to methacholine challenge at 9 months and 33 months (P=0.02 for both comparisons). After three years, the bone density of the lumbar spine and the femur was significantly lower in the triamcinolone group (P < or = 0.007). Inhaled triamcinolone does not slow the rate of decline in lung function in people with COPD, but it improves airway reactivity and respiratory symptoms and decreases the use of health care services for respiratory problems. These benefits should be weighed against the potential long-term adverse effects of triamcinolone on bone mineral density.","In mild to moderate COPD, patients treated with triamcinolone had fewer respiratory symptoms (P=.005), fewer visits to a physician because of respiratory illness (P=.003), and improved airway reactivity (P=.02)."
"Which factors increase the risk of an infant becoming an overweight child
To review the literature on the association between birthweight and body mass index (BMI) and obesity in later life. Included in the review were papers appearing in Medline since 1966 and identified using the search terms obesity, body fat, waist, body constitution, birthweight and birth weight. Further papers were identified by examining bibliographies. There is good evidence that there is an association between birthweight and subsequent BMI and overweight in young adults and children, which is linear and positive in some studies and J- or U-shaped in others. The evidence is less strong for middle-aged subjects. Studies that have assessed lean body mass (LBM) and fat body mass have tended to find that birthweight is positively associated with LBM and negatively associated with relative adiposity. This suggests that the association between birthweight and BMI/overweight does not necessarily reflect increased adiposity at higher birthweights. On controlling for current body mass there is fairly consistent evidence of a negative association between birthweight and a central pattern of fat distribution as measured by central:peripheral skinfold ratios. It has been suggested that the prenatal period is a 'critical' period for the development of adiposity, but it is unclear how far associations between birthweight and subsequent body habitus are genetic in origin and how far they result from intrauterine 'programming'. Two lines of evidence would suggest that the association is predominantly genetic. Studies of monozygotic twins have found environmentally determined differences in birthweight to be unrelated to subsequent BMI, and the association between birthweight and BMI is substantially reduced on controlling for parental BMI. However, some evidence of an influence of intrauterine environment on later obesity comes from studies of subjects who were exposed in utero to the effects of diabetes, famine conditions or smoking. The reasons for the positive association between birthweight and BMI remain unclear. More studies including accurate measurement of body composition are needed to assess how far this relation is accounted for by changes in fat mass or by changes in lean mass. Studies with accurate measures of parental BMI would also be useful in assessing the importance of this confounder.",A meta-analysis found a positive association in 25 of 28 studies that examined birth weight and body mass index in childhood. This descriptive meta-analysis did not calculate pooled odds ratios (ORs) because of heterogeneity of the ages included and methods used to measure obesity.
"Should we screen for bacterial vaginosis in those at risk for preterm labor
We performed a meta-analysis to evaluate bacterial vaginosis as a risk factor for preterm delivery. Selection criteria were (1). the data appeared in original, published English-language reports of prospective studies or control groups of clinical trials that included women at <37 weeks of gestation with intact amniotic membranes, (2). all the women had to have been screened for bacterial vaginosis that was diagnosed by either clinical criteria or criteria that were based on Gram stain findings, and (3). the outcomes were preterm delivery, spontaneous abortion, maternal or neonatal infection, and perinatal death. Eighteen studies with results for 20,232 patients were included. Bacterial vaginosis increased the risk of preterm delivery >2-fold (odds ratio, 2.19; 95% CI, 1.54-3.12). Higher risks were calculated for subgroups of studies that screened for bacterial vaginosis at <16 weeks of gestation (odds ratio, 7.55; 95% CI, 1.80-31.65) or at <20 weeks of gestation (odds ratio, 4.20; 95% CI, 2.11-8.39). Bacterial vaginosis also significantly increased the risk of spontaneous abortion (odds ratio, 9.91; 95% CI, 1.99-49.34) and maternal infection (odds ratio, 2.53; 95% CI, 1.26-5.08). No significant results were calculated for the outcome of neonatal infection or perinatal death. Bacterial vaginosis, early in pregnancy, is a strong risk factor for preterm delivery and spontaneous abortion.","Bacterial vaginosis in early pregnancy is a risk factor for preterm delivery. The role of bacterial vaginosis in preterm labor is not well understood, but it has been consistently associated with preterm labor and delivery. The detection of bacterial vaginosis in early pregnancy seems to be a stronger risk factor for preterm delivery than bacterial vaginosis in later pregnancy."
"What is the prognosis for acute low back pain
To explore the relationship between type of initial care as well as the likelihood of recurrence and consequent care seeking behavior. Prospective observational cohort recruited from 208 randomly selected North Carolina practices. Cohort study examined the recurrence of low back pain among patients free of back pain 3 months after their index visit to a practitioner for that problem. The following four practitioner strata were examined: primary care providers, chiropractors, orthopedic surgeons, and practitioners in a group model HMO. Patients were interviewed by telephone at 6 and 22 months after the initial visit. Rates of disabling and non-disabling low back pain; functional status using the Roland back disability scale; and care seeking. Rates of recurrence were substantial; functionally disabling recurrence rates varied between 8% and 14% between 3 to 6 months, and 20% to 35% between 6 to 22 months. Differences in rates among practitioner strata were statistically significant only between 6 to 22 months with higher recurrence rates for HMO patients. Functional status, number of bed days, and time off work were very similar among the practitioner strata. Care seeking, however, was greater among those patients who had initially seen a chiropractor for their back pain. Patients with recurrence saw the same practitioner type they had seen for the index episode 88% of the time. Satisfaction was slightly greater for patients who saw chiropractors when compared with patients seeing allopathic physicians. The recurrence of low back pain is common. Severe disability is rare. Patients who had sought care from chiropractors are more likely to return for recurrences than patients who had initially sought care from MDs.","Another prospective study of 208 patients found that 35% to 44% of patients had recurrence of pain within 6 months of their first episode, and 50% to 59% had a recurrence in 22 months of follow-up."
"What is the best macrolide for atypical pneumonia
An open, randomized, multicentre study compared the efficacy and safety of the prototype, azalide, azithromycin, and erythromycin in the treatment of atypical pneumonias. Azithromycin was administered for five days at a dosage of 250 mg bd on day 1 and 250 mg once daily on days 2 to 5. Erythromycin was given for ten days at 500 mg qid. Causative pathogens were identified by serological methods. Of 57 patients treated with azithromycin, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia psittaci were identified in 31 and eight patients, respectively. Of 44 patients treated with erythromycin, M. pneumoniae and C. psittaci were identified in 24 and eight patients, respectively. There were no therapeutic failures in either treatment group. Side effects were observed in one of 57 patients on azithromycin and in six of 44 patients on erythromycin. Azithromycin appears to be as effective as erythromycin in the treatment of atypical pneumonias and better tolerated.","A study looked at patients aged 12 to 80 years with pneumonia due to M pneumoniae (75 cases) or Chlamydophila psittaci (formerly Chlamydia psittaci, 16 cases). All patients responded to treatment."
"What hormonal contraception is most effective for obese wome
DMPA-SC 104 mg/0.65 mL is a new, low-dose subcutaneous (SC) formulation of Depo-Provera contraceptive injection (150 mg/mL medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension) that provides efficacy, safety and immediacy of onset equivalent to Depo-Provera intramuscular (IM) injection. Two large, open-label, Phase 3 studies assessed the 1-year contraceptive efficacy, safety and patient satisfaction with DMPA-SC administered every 3 months (12-13 weeks). Zero pregnancies were reported in both studies, which included a total of 16,023 woman-cycles of exposure to DMPA-SC and substantial numbers of overweight or obese women. DMPA-SC was well-tolerated and adverse events were similar to those reported previously with Depo-Provera IM. Thus, DMPA-SC offers women a new, highly effective and convenient long-acting contraceptive option.","Data suggest that increased body weight does not decrease the efficacy of DMPA. In 2 large open-label studies, no pregnancies were observed, regardless of BMI."
"How effective is gastric bypass for weight loss
The beneficial effects of weight loss in the obese have been widely accepted. Still, there is a lack of controlled studies displaying large maintained weight losses over long periods (>4 years). We wanted to examine the results of long-standing intentional weight loss on the development of diabetes and hypertension in severely obese individuals over an 8-year period. In the ongoing prospective Swedish Obese Subjects (SOS) study, 346 patients awaiting gastric surgery were matched with 346 obese control subjects on 18 variables by a computerized matching program. The controls were drawn from a registry consisting of 1508 obese potential controls examined at primary health care centers in Sweden. Of the 692 selected patients (body mass index 41.2+/-4.7 kg/m(2) [mean+/-SD]), 483 (70%) were followed for 8 years. No significant weight changes occurred in the obese control group over 8 years. Gastric surgery resulted in a maximum weight loss of -31.1+/-13.6 kg after 1 year. After 8 years, the maintained weight loss was still 20.1+/-15.7 kg (16.3+/-12.3%). Whereas this weight reduction had a dramatic effect on the 8-year incidence of diabetes (odds ratio 0.16, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.36), it had no effect on the 8-year incidence of hypertension (odds ratio 1.01, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.67). A differentiated risk factor response was identified: a maintained weight reduction of 16% strongly counteracted the development of diabetes over 8 years but showed no long-term effect on the incidence of hypertension.",A study demonstrated 25% ± 6% weight loss vs 0.9% gain at 8 years.
"What is the appropriate diagnostic evaluation of fibroids
The purpose of this study was to evaluate and compare the accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging and transvaginal ultrasonography in myoma diagnosis, mapping, and measurement. This was a double-blind study of 106 consecutive premenopausal women who underwent hysterectomy for benign reasons. Myomas (total, 257) were exactly mapped by magnetic resonance imaging and transvaginal ultrasonography; in each patient, we counted correctly identified myomas with pathologic position as true value. The presence of myomas was detected with the same high level of precision by both methods (magnetic resonance imaging: sensitivity, 0.99; specificity, 0.86; transvaginal ultrasonography: sensitivity, 0.99; specificity, 0.91). The mean number of correctly identified myomas was significantly higher by magnetic resonance imaging than by transvaginal ultrasonography (mean difference, 0.51 +/- 1.03; P <.001), a difference that narrowed to 0.08 +/- 0.76 (P =.60) in 26 patients with 1 to 4 myomas and uterine volumes <375 mL. Magnetic resonance imaging and transvaginal ultrasonography myoma diameter measurements had equal and high accuracies in patients with 1 to 4 myomas. Transvaginal ultrasonography is as efficient as magnetic resonance imaging in detecting myoma presence, but its capacity for exact myoma mapping falls short of that of magnetic resonance imaging, especially in large (>375 mL) multiple-myoma (>4) uteri.","transvaginal sonography has high sensitivity for detecting myomas in a uterus of <10-week size. The use of high-frequency probes improves the sensitivity for diagnosing small myomas, although their precise location with respect to the uterine cavity often remains uncertain. Localization of fibroids in a larger uterus or when there are many tumors is limited."
"Which postmenopausal women should be offered combined hormone replacement therapy
Despite decades of accumulated observational evidence, the balance of risks and benefits for hormone use in healthy postmenopausal women remains uncertain. To assess the major health benefits and risks of the most commonly used combined hormone preparation in the United States. Estrogen plus progestin component of the Women's Health Initiative, a randomized controlled primary prevention trial (planned duration, 8.5 years) in which 16608 postmenopausal women aged 50-79 years with an intact uterus at baseline were recruited by 40 US clinical centers in 1993-1998. Participants received conjugated equine estrogens, 0.625 mg/d, plus medroxyprogesterone acetate, 2.5 mg/d, in 1 tablet (n = 8506) or placebo (n = 8102). The primary outcome was coronary heart disease (CHD) (nonfatal myocardial infarction and CHD death), with invasive breast cancer as the primary adverse outcome. A global index summarizing the balance of risks and benefits included the 2 primary outcomes plus stroke, pulmonary embolism (PE), endometrial cancer, colorectal cancer, hip fracture, and death due to other causes. On May 31, 2002, after a mean of 5.2 years of follow-up, the data and safety monitoring board recommended stopping the trial of estrogen plus progestin vs placebo because the test statistic for invasive breast cancer exceeded the stopping boundary for this adverse effect and the global index statistic supported risks exceeding benefits. This report includes data on the major clinical outcomes through April 30, 2002. Estimated hazard ratios (HRs) (nominal 95% confidence intervals [CIs]) were as follows: CHD, 1.29 (1.02-1.63) with 286 cases; breast cancer, 1.26 (1.00-1.59) with 290 cases; stroke, 1.41 (1.07-1.85) with 212 cases; PE, 2.13 (1.39-3.25) with 101 cases; colorectal cancer, 0.63 (0.43-0.92) with 112 cases; endometrial cancer, 0.83 (0.47-1.47) with 47 cases; hip fracture, 0.66 (0.45-0.98) with 106 cases; and death due to other causes, 0.92 (0.74-1.14) with 331 cases. Corresponding HRs (nominal 95% CIs) for composite outcomes were 1.22 (1.09-1.36) for total cardiovascular disease (arterial and venous disease), 1.03 (0.90-1.17) for total cancer, 0.76 (0.69-0.85) for combined fractures, 0.98 (0.82-1.18) for total mortality, and 1.15 (1.03-1.28) for the global index. Absolute excess risks per 10 000 person-years attributable to estrogen plus progestin were 7 more CHD events, 8 more strokes, 8 more PEs, and 8 more invasive breast cancers, while absolute risk reductions per 10 000 person-years were 6 fewer colorectal cancers and 5 fewer hip fractures. The absolute excess risk of events included in the global index was 19 per 10 000 person-years. Overall health risks exceeded benefits from use of combined estrogen plus progestin for an average 5.2-year follow-up among healthy postmenopausal US women. All-cause mortality was not affected during the trial. The risk-benefit profile found in this trial is not consistent with the requirements for a viable intervention for primary prevention of chronic diseases, and the results indicate that this regimen should not be initiated or continued for primary prevention of CHD.",An ongoing arm of women's health initiative is studying estrogen alone in postmenopausal women who have had a hysterectomy.
"What physical exam techniques are useful to detect malingering
Nonorganic physical signs in low-back pain are described and standardized in 350 North American and British patients. These nonorganic signs are distinguishable from the standard clinical signs of physical pathology and correlate with other psychological data. By helping to separate the physical from the nonorganic they clarify the assessment of purely physical pathologic conditions. It is suggested also that the nonorganic signs can be used as a simple clinical screen to help identify patients who require more detailed psychological assessment.","Several exam tests are commonly thought to detect nonorganic causes of low back pain. Gordon Waddell described 8 signs in 5 categories used to ""identify [back pain] patients who require more detailed psychological assessment.""."
"Does the age you introduce food to an infant affect allergies later
The natural history of allergic disease and its potential for prevention merit close examination because of the explosive worldwide increase in the prevalence and morbidity of atopic disorders. This study examines the development of atopy at age 7 years in 165 children in a high-risk cohort, previously reported from birth to age 4 years. In this prospective, randomized, controlled study of food allergen avoidance in infancy, the prophylactic-treated group consisted of infants whose mothers avoided cow's milk, egg, and peanut during the last trimester of pregnancy and lactation and who, themselves, avoided cow's milk until age 1 year (casein hydrolysate supplementation before age 1), egg until age 2 years, and peanut and fish until age 3 years. The control group consisted of maternal/infant pairs who followed standard feeding practices. Despite a significant reduction in food allergy and milk sensitization before age 2 years, none of the following differed between the groups at age 7 years: food allergy, atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis, asthma, any atopic disease, lung function, food or aeroallergen sensitization, serum IgE level, or presence of nasal eosinophils or nasal basophilic cells. Children with food allergy by 4 years evidenced higher 7-year (current) prevalences of allergic rhinitis and asthma (p < 0.01). Atopic diseases/parameters at age 7 years were shown, by multivariate analysis (p < 0.05), to be associated with several genetic and environmental risk factors (male gender, maternal nonwhite ethnicity and asthma, and household smoking), as well as predictive atopic markers during infancy (elevated serum IgE level; egg, cow's milk, and peanut sensitization; and nasal eosinophils and nasal basophilic cells). These findings help to: (1) elucidate the natural history of atopic disease in high-risk children; (2) document the progression of allergy from atopic dermatitis, food allergy, and food sensitization to respiratory allergy and aeroallergen sensitization despite food allergy prevention in infancy; (3) identify allergy predictive markers; and (4) expand our appreciation of the interactions of genetic and environmental factors in the development of atopy.","A study randomized 165 high-risk children into groups with standard feeding practices or an allergy prophylaxis regimen, which included avoidance of milk protein until age 1 year, eggs until 2 years, and fish and peanuts until 3 years. Although prophylaxis decreased the prevalence of atopic disorders at 1 year, there was no difference in any atopic disease between the 2 groups at age 7."
"Is combining angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors and ARBs helpful or harmful
Additive hemodynamic effects of combined blockade of the renin-angiotensin system by an angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitor and an angiotensin II antagonist have been observed in sodium-depleted normotensive volunteers and in patients with congestive heart failure. To investigate whether the same additive hemodynamic effects occur in patients with hypertension and to verify the safety of such an approach. Multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, pilot study. 177 patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension [diastolic blood pressure (DBP): 95-115 mmHg after a 4-week placebo run-in period] were included in the study. Combination therapy consisting of 50 mg losartan daily and 10 mg enalapril daily was administered for 6 weeks. The effects of this therapeutic regimen was compared with similar groups of patients who received either 50 mg losartan daily or 10 mg enalapril daily. 24-hour ambulatory mean DBP and clinic DBP measured at trough after 6 weeks of treatment. 24-hour ambulatory mean DBP did not significantly differ between treatment groups although the combination tended to lower BP more. The combination therapy was more effective on clinic DBP measured at trough than was losartan by 3.2 mmHg [confidence interval (95%, CI) 0.7-5.7 mmHg, P = 0.012], and more effective than enalapril by 4.0 mmHg (95% CI, 1.5-6.4 mmHg, P = 0.002). In a subgroup of 28 patients, higher plasma active renin and angiotensin I levels during blockade by the combination therapy were observed. This finding confirmed that the combination of the two agents inhibited the renin-angiotensin system to a greater extent than did either agent alone. A combination of 10 mg enalapril daily and 50 mg losartan daily safely induces a supplementary, although modest, fall in clinic DBP in patients with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension.","One trial of 177 patients found no significant difference in 24-hour ambulatory mean diastolic blood pressure with combination therapy vs angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor or ARB monotherapy, but did show a decrease in clinic diastolic blood pressure."
"Is an outpatient workup safe for patients with a transient ischemic attack
To evaluate the investigation and treatment of patients with a diagnosis of transient ischemic attacks (TIA) in the emergency department (ED) a tertiary care teaching hospital with a neuroscience referral program. A chart review was conducted in the hospital. Consecutive ED charts with a diagnosis of TIA were included; each was reviewed by independent coders using a standardized data form. Two hundred and ninety-three TIA charts were reviewed; the gender ratio was 1:1 with a mean age of 66 years. Most patients (75%; 95% CI: 70, 80) were evaluated by ED physicians; the remaining patients were seen directly by referral services. The median time from symptom onset to ED arrival was 29 hours and the duration of symptoms was 4.6 hours. Most patients received CT scans (81%; 95% CI: 73, 85), complete blood counts (74%; 95% CI: 68, 79), and electrocardiograms (75%; 95% CI: 70, 80) in the ED. In 16% (95% CI: 13, 22) a carotid doppler was performed and in 26% (95% CI: 21, 31) an outpatient doppler was booked. Among those who were discharged (75%; 95% CI: 70, 80), antithrombotic medications were not prescribed to 28% (95% CI: 22, 34). Practice variation exists with respect to the investigation and treatment of TIAs in this tertiary-care teaching hospital. Carotid doppler investigation and use of anti-platelet therapy for patients with TIA are suboptimal. Clinical practice guidelines and rapid assessment TIA clinics may change these results.","In 1 study of TIA patients presenting to an emergency department, 81% had a computed tomography scan, 75% had electrocardiogram, and 74% had a complete blood count. Carotid Doppler imaging was performed in the emergency department in 16%, and 26% were referred for outpatient Doppler studies. One percent had an electrocardiogram in the emergency department, and 16% were given ECGs as outpatients. Seventy-five percent of patients were discharged home. Those hospitalized had a median length of stay of 1 day."
"What treatments work best for constipation in children
Recently, polyethylene glycol (PEG 3350) has been suggested as a good alternative laxative to lactulose as a treatment option in paediatric constipation. However, no large randomised controlled trials exist evaluating the efficacy of either laxative. To compare PEG 3350 (Transipeg: polyethylene glycol with electrolytes) with lactulose in paediatric constipation and evaluate clinical efficacy/side effects. One hundred patients (aged 6 months-15 years) with paediatric constipation were included in an eight week double blinded, randomised, controlled trial. After faecal disimpaction, patients <6 years of age received PEG 3350 (2.95 g/sachet) or lactulose (6 g/sachet) while children > or =6 years started with 2 sachets/day. Primary outcome measures were: defecation and encopresis frequency/week and successful treatment after eight weeks. Success was defined as a defecation frequency > or =3/week and encopresis < or =1 every two weeks. Secondary outcome measures were side effects after eight weeks of treatment. A total of 91 patients (49 male) completed the study. A significant increase in defecation frequency (PEG 3350: 3 pre v 7 post treatment/week; lactulose: 3 pre v 6 post/week) and a significant decrease in encopresis frequency (PEG 3350: 10 pre v 3 post/week; lactulose: 8 pre v 3 post/week) was found in both groups (NS). However, success was significantly higher in the PEG group (56%) compared with the lactulose group (29%). PEG 3350 patients reported less abdominal pain, straining, and pain at defecation than children using lactulose. However, bad taste was reported significantly more often in the PEG group. PEG 3350 (0.26 (0.11) g/kg), compared with lactulose (0.66 (0.32) g/kg), provided a higher success rate with fewer side effects. PEG 3350 should be the laxative of first choice in childhood constipation.","One good-quality randomized controlled trials (100 children, 6 months to 15 years old with CFC) compared polyethylene glycol + E with lactulose. Both significantly increased stool frequency and decreased encopresis. However, polyethylene glycol + E had a markedly higher success rate (56% vs 29%; NNT=3.7; P=.02). The 8-week trial found significantly more complaints about bad taste in the polyethylene glycol + E group; the lactulose group reported higher rates of abdominal pain, straining, and pain at defecation. The only dropout because of adverse events (bad taste) occurred in the polyethylene glycol + E group."
"How reliable are self-measured blood pressures taken at home
Self-measurement of blood pressure is increasingly used in clinical practice, but how it affects the treatment of hypertension requires further study. To compare use of blood pressure (BP) measurements taken in physicians' offices and at home in the treatment of patients with hypertension. Blinded randomized controlled trial conducted from March 1997 to April 2002 at 56 primary care practices and 3 hospital-based outpatient clinics in Belgium and 1 specialized hypertension clinic in Dublin, Ireland. Four hundred participants with a diastolic BP (DBP) of 95 mm Hg or more as measured at physicians' offices were enrolled and followed up for 1 year. Antihypertensive drug treatment was adjusted in a stepwise fashion based on either the self-measured DBP at home (average of 6 measurements per day during 1 week; n = 203) or the average of 3 sitting DBP readings at the physician's office (n = 197). If the DBP guiding treatment was above (>89 mm Hg), at (80-89 mm Hg), or below (<80 mm Hg) target, a physician blinded to randomization intensified antihypertensive treatment, left it unchanged, or reduced it, respectively. Office and home BP levels, 24-hour ambulatory BP, intensity of drug treatment, electrocardiographic and echocardiographic left ventricular mass, symptoms reported by questionnaire, and costs of treatment. At the end of the study (median follow-up, 350 days; interquartile range, 326-409 days), more home BP than office BP patients had stopped antihypertensive drug treatment (25.6% vs 11.3%; P<.001) with no significant difference in the proportions of patients progressing to multiple-drug treatment (38.7% vs 45.1%; P =.14). The final office, home, and 24-hour ambulatory BP measurements were higher (P<.001) in the home BP group than in the office BP group. The mean baseline-adjusted systolic/diastolic differences between the home and office BP groups averaged 6.8/3.5 mm Hg, 4.9/2.9 mm Hg, and 4.9/2.9 mm Hg, respectively. Left ventricular mass and reported symptoms were similar in the 2 groups. Costs per 100 patients followed up for 1 month were only slightly lower in the home BP group (3875 vs 3522 [4921 dollars vs 4473 dollars]; P =.04). Adjustment of antihypertensive treatment based on home BP instead of office BP led to less intensive drug treatment and marginally lower costs but also to less BP control, with no differences in general well-being or left ventricular mass. Self-measurement allowed identification of patients with white-coat hypertension. Our findings support a stepwise strategy for the evaluation of BP in which self-measurement and ambulatory monitoring are complementary to conventional office measurement and highlight the need for prospective outcome studies to establish the normal range of home-measured BP.","The treatment of hypertension based on home or office blood pressure trial was a single-blinded, randomized controlled trial of hypertensive treatment based on self measured blood pressure vs OBP. Four hundred patients were randomized to self measured blood pressure or OBP, with medication adjustments made by a blinded clinician. The trial design called for both treatment groups to be titrated to a diastolic blood pressure of 80 to 89 mm Hg. The follow-up was approximately 1 year. Graphical data indicate that both groups were equally effective in meeting the blood pressure goals outlined in the methods."
"Should you use antibiotics to treat acute otitis media in children
The goal was to determine the predictors of a prolonged course for children with acute otitis media. A meta-analysis of data with the observation groups of 6 randomized, controlled trials was performed. Participants were 824 children, 6 months to 12 years of age, with acute otitis media. The primary outcome was a prolonged course of acute otitis media, which was defined as fever and/or pain at 3 to 7 days. Of the 824 included children, 303 had pain and/or fever at 3 to 7 days. Independent predictors of a prolonged course were age of < 2 years and bilateral acute otitis media. The absolute risk of pain and/or fever at 3 to 7 days for children < 2 years of age with bilateral acute otitis media (20% of all children) was 55%, and that for children > or = 2 years of age with unilateral acute otitis media (47% of all children) was 25%. The risk of a prolonged course was 2 times higher for children < 2 years of age with bilateral acute otitis media than for children > or = 2 years of age with unilateral acute otitis media. Clinicians can use these features (ie, age of < 2 years and bilateral acute otitis media) to inform parents more explicitly about the expected course of their child's otitis media and to explain which features should prompt parents to contact their clinician for reexamination of the child.","A secondary analysis of cohorts from 6 RCTs (a total of 824 children untreated for AOM) identified age younger than 2 years (OR=2.07; 95% CI, 1.47-2.91; P<.0001) and bilateral disease (OR=1.70; 95% CI, 1.19-2.41; P=.003) as independent risk factors for pain and fever at 3 to 7 days of illness. However, the study did not address whether antibiotics would actually mitigate the risk factors."
"Which drugs are most effective for moderate to severe depression in adolescents
There is a need to identify effective and safe treatments for depression in children and adolescents. While tricyclic drugs are effective in treating depression in adults, individual studies involving children and adolescents have been equivocal. To assess the effects of oral tricyclic antidepressants compared to placebo in the treatment of child and adolescent depression. We searched MEDLINE (1966-1997), EMBASE, Excerpta Medica (June 1974-1997), the Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group trials register (most recent search 25/1/2000) and bibliographies of previously published reviews and papers describing original research were cross-checked. Current Contents was screened for recent publications. We contacted authors of relevant abstracts in conference proceedings of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, and we hand searched the Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (1978-1999). Randomised controlled trials comparing the efficacy of orally administered tricyclic medication with placebo in depressed people aged 6-18 years. Most studies reported multiple outcome measures including depression scales and clinical global impression scales. For each study the best available depression measure was taken as the index measure of depression outcome. Predetermined criteria were established to assist in the ranking of measures. Where authors reported categorical outcomes we calculated individual and pooled odds ratios for the odds of improvement in treated compared with control subjects. For continuous outcomes pooled effect sizes were calculated as the number of standard deviations by which the change in depression scores for the treatment group exceeded those for the control groups. Thirteen trials (involving 506 participants) were included. No overall improvement with treatment compared to placebo was seen for children or adolescents (odds ratio = 0.84, 95% confidence interval 0.56 to 1.25). A statistically significant but small benefit of treatment over placebo was seen in reducing symptoms (effect size (standardised mean difference) = -0.31, 95% confidence interval -0.62 to -0.01). Subgroup analyses suggest a larger benefit among adolescents (effect size = -0.47, 95% confidence interval -0.92 to -0.02), and no benefit among children (effect size = 0.15, 95% confidence interval -0.34 to 0.64). Treatment with a tricyclic antidepressant caused more vertigo (odds ratio = 4.38, 95% confidence interval 2.33 to 8.25), orthostatic hypotension (odds ratio = 6.78, 95% confidence interval 2.06 to 22.26), tremor (odds ratio 6.29, 95% confidence interval 1.78 to 22.17) and dry mouth (odds ratio = 5.17, 95% confidence interval 2.68 to 29.99) than did placebo, but no statistically significant difference was found for other possible adverse effects. Data suggest tricyclic antidepressants are not useful in treating depression in pre pubertal children. There is marginal evidence to support the use of tricyclic antidepressants in the treatment of depression in adolescents, although the magnitude of effect is likely to be moderate at best.","A 2002 Cochrane meta-analysis reported marginal evidence to support using tricyclic antidepressants for treating adolescents. However, these drugs have significantly more side effects than placebo. No placebo-controlled RCTs of bupropion, duloxetine, mirtazapine, or St. John's wort for treating major depressive disorder in adolescents were identified."
"How should you manage an overweight breastfed infant
In an experimental study to determine whether augmentation of maternal milk supply affects infant intake, 18 mothers of exclusively breast-fed infants stimulated milk supply by daily expression of extra milk for 2 weeks. Infant milk intake was recorded before, during and after this expression phase. All but 4 mothers increased milk production by greater than 73 g/day over baseline, with an average increase of 124 g/day. On the average, the 14 infants of mothers who increased milk production took in significantly more milk immediately following the expression phase (849 vs. 732 g/day), but about half of them returned to near baseline levels of milk intake after 1-2 weeks. Net change in infant intake at the end of the study was positively correlated with infant weight-for-length (r = 0.59) and age (r = 0.58), and was unrelated to baseline milk intake (r = -0.06). Therefore, the wide range in breast milk volume in well-nourished populations is due more to variation in infant ""demand"" than to inadequacy of milk production.",Expressing breast milk to increase infant intake increases weight gain (r=0.59); this effect gets stronger as the infant gets older (r=0.58).
"Is exercise treadmill testing useful for detecting heart disease in women
The value of exercise testing in women has been questioned. To determine the prognostic value of exercise testing in a population-based cohort of asymptomatic women followed up for 20 years. Near-maximal Bruce-protocol treadmill test data from the Lipid Research Clinics Prevalence Study (1972-1976) with follow-up through 1995. A total of 2994 asymptomatic North American women, aged 30 to 80 years, without known cardiovascular disease. Cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. There were 427 (14%) deaths during 20 years of follow-up, of which 147 were due to cardiovascular causes. Low exercise capacity, low heart rate recovery (HRR), and not achieving target heart rate were independently associated with increased all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. There was no increased cardiovascular death risk for exercise-induced ST-segment depression (age-adjusted hazard ratio, 1.02; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.57-1.80; P =.96). The age-adjusted hazard ratio for cardiovascular death for every metabolic equivalent (MET) decrement in exercise capacity was 1.20 (95% CI, 1.18-1.30; P<.001); for every 10 beats per minute decrement in HRR, the hazard ratio was 1.36 (95% CI, 1.19-1.55; P<.001). After adjusting for multiple other risk factors, women who were below the median for both exercise capacity and HRR had a 3.5-fold increased risk of cardiovascular death (95% CI, 1.57-7.86; P =.002) compared with those above the median for both variables. Among women with low risk Framingham scores, those with below median levels of both exercise capacity and HRR had significantly increased risk compared with women who had above median levels of these 2 exercise variables, 44.5 and 3.5 cardiovascular deaths per 10 000 person-years, respectively (hazard ratio for cardiovascular death, 12.93; 95% CI, 5.62-29.73; P<.001). The prognostic value of exercise testing in asymptomatic women derives not from electrocardiographic ischemia but from fitness-related variables.","A large cohort study of 2994 asymptomatic women found that those women with a below-average peak exercise capacity and heart-rate recovery rate were 3.5 times more likely to die of cardiovascular causes than women who were above average (95% CI, 1.57-7.86)."
"Are inhalers with spacers better than nebulizers for children with asthma
The aim of this study was to compare the response to inhaled albuterol after administration by nebulizer with the response after administration by a metered-dose inhaler and spacer device (MDI-spacer) to children with acute asthma. In a double-blind fashion, 33 children (6 to 14 years of age) with forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) between 20% and 70% of predicted values, and who were seen in the emergency department with acute asthma, were studied. They were treated with aerosolized albuterol or placebo by MDI-spacer, followed immediately by albuterol or placebo administered by nebulizer with oxygen. The dose ratio for albuterol by MDI-spacer versus nebulizer was 1:5. Outcome measures included a clinical score, respiratory rate, arterial oxygen saturation, and FEV1, measured before and 10, 20, and 40 minutes after treatment. With the exception of heart rate (which increased in the nebulizer group and decreased in the MDI-spacer group (p < 0.05), no difference in the rate of improvement of clinical score, respiratory rate, arterial oxygen saturation, or FEV1 was noted during the 40-minute study period between children who received albuterol by nebulizer and those who received it by MDI-spacer. We conclude that spacers and nebulizers are equally effective means of delivering beta 2-agonists to children with acute asthma.","A double-blinded randomized controlled trial of 33 children aged 6 to 14 years showed no difference in metered dose inhaler spacer vs nebulizer, as measured by clinical score, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and forced expiratory volume at 1 second (FEV1). The researchers calculated the study had 90% power to detect a clinically meaningful difference in FEV1 of 12% of the predicted value between the groups."
"Is nedocromil effective in preventing asthmatic attacks in patients with asthma
In a double-blind placebo-controlled trial nedocromil sodium in a dose of 8 mg four times daily or matching placebo was added to the treatment of 29 asthmatic patients. All patients were taking inhaled corticosteroids in a dose of up to 1000 micrograms daily. The trial agents were given for 6 weeks after a 2-week run-in period. Twenty-four patients completed the study, three withdrew because of adverse effects, two on placebo. Daytime asthma symptoms were significantly reduced on nedocromil compared to placebo (-0.46 vs. +0.09, P = 0.03). Night-time asthma and morning tightness were not changed significantly. Bronchodilator use in the night and day were lower on nedocromil but the differences were not significant. Morning peak flow rates were higher on nedocromil (+22.2 vs. +0.08, P = 0.06) and physicians opinions of overall effectiveness favoured nedocromil (U = 35.0, P = 0.04). These results confirm that nedocromil sodium may be a useful addition in asthma to low to medium doses of inhaled corticosteroids. The effects of 32 mg nedocromil daily were comparable to previous reports with lower doses.","A small study of patients already on inhaled steroid found nonsignificant trends towards reductions in bronchodilator use, increased PEFR, increased FEV1, and improved quality of life."
"Which drugs are most effective for moderate to severe depression in adolescents
Initial treatment of major depressive disorder in adolescents may include cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). However, little is known about their relative or combined effectiveness. To evaluate the effectiveness of 4 treatments among adolescents with major depressive disorder. Randomized controlled trial of a volunteer sample of 439 patients between the ages of 12 to 17 years with a primary Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, diagnosis of major depressive disorder. The trial was conducted at 13 US academic and community clinics between spring 2000 and summer 2003. Twelve weeks of (1) fluoxetine alone (10 to 40 mg/d), (2) CBT alone, (3) CBT with fluoxetine (10 to 40 mg/d), or (4) placebo (equivalent to 10 to 40 mg/d). Placebo and fluoxetine alone were administered double-blind; CBT alone and CBT with fluoxetine were administered unblinded. Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised total score and, for responder analysis, a (dichotomized) Clinical Global Impressions improvement score. Compared with placebo, the combination of fluoxetine with CBT was statistically significant (P =.001) on the Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised. Compared with fluoxetine alone (P =.02) and CBT alone (P =.01), treatment of fluoxetine with CBT was superior. Fluoxetine alone is a superior treatment to CBT alone (P =.01). Rates of response for fluoxetine with CBT were 71.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], 62%-80%); fluoxetine alone, 60.6% (95% CI, 51%-70%); CBT alone, 43.2% (95% CI, 34%-52%); and placebo, 34.8% (95% CI, 26%-44%). On the Clinical Global Impressions improvement responder analysis, the 2 fluoxetine-containing conditions were statistically superior to CBT and to placebo. Clinically significant suicidal thinking, which was present in 29% of the sample at baseline, improved significantly in all 4 treatment groups. Fluoxetine with CBT showed the greatest reduction (P =.02). Seven (1.6%) of 439 patients attempted suicide; there were no completed suicides. The combination of fluoxetine with CBT offered the most favorable tradeoff between benefit and risk for adolescents with major depressive disorder.","The landmark Treatment for Adolescents with Depression Study, which was included in the meta-analysis, comprised 4 treatment arms: fluoxetine alone, cognitive-behavioral treatment alone, fluoxetine with CBT, and placebo. Only the combination therapy group showed a statistically significant improvement compared with placebo in the primary outcome (improved Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised). Improvement in the Clinical Global Impressions score, a subjective measure, was statistically significant in 71% of patients receiving combination therapy and 60.6% of those treated with fluoxetine compared with placebo (34.8%) or cognitive-behavioral treatment alone (43.2%)."
"Which technique for removing nevi is least scarring
These guidelines for management of cutaneous melanoma present evidence-based guidance for treatment, with identification of the strength of evidence available at the time of preparation of the guidelines, and a brief overview of epidemiological aspects, diagnosis and investigation. To reflect the collaborative process for the U.K., they are subject to dual publication in the British Journal of Dermatology and the British Journal of Plastic Surgery.","The UK Guidelines for the Management of Cutaneous Melanoma recommend that suspicious lesions be excised completely excisional biopsy and sent for confirmatory histopathological examination. A biopsy that transects the depth of the lesion for example, superficial shave biopsy should be avoided because histological depth of invasion is the basic criterion for staging and shave biopsy makes the staging impossible in some cases."
"What are the indications for bariatric surgery
Surgeons, gastroenterologists, endocrinologists, psychiatrists, nutritionists, and other health care professionals, as well as members of the public convened to address nonsurgical treatments for severe obesity, surgical treatments for severe obesity, and criteria for selection, the efficacy, and risks of surgical treatments for severe obesity, and the need for future research on and epidemiologic evaluation of these therapies. The National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Panel recommended that patients seeking therapy for severe obesity for the first time should be considered for treatment in a nonsurgical program that integrates a dietary regimen, appropriate exercise, behavior modification, and psychological support; that gastric restrictive or bypass procedures could be considered for well-informed and motivated patients in whom the operative risks were acceptable; that patients who are candidates for surgical procedures should be selected carefully after evaluation by a multidisciplinary team with medical, surgical, psychiatric, and nutritional expertise; that surgery be done by a surgeon who has substantial experience in the particular procedure and who works in a clinical setting with adequate support for all aspects of management and assessment; and that patients undergo lifelong medical surveillance after surgery.","Patients with a body mass index >40 have substantially more serious health consequences and a reduced life expectancy. Obesity significantly impairs quality of life, and the risk of morbidity and mortality increases with the degree of obesity. Those who are extremely obese often do not have sustained benefit from more conservative treatment. The benefits of nonsurgical treatment are significantly limited by the failure to maintain reduced body weight. The national institutes of health statement ""Gastrointestinal Surgery for Severe Obesity"" concluded that the benefits outweigh the risks and that surgical treatment is reasonable in those who strongly desire substantial weight loss and have life-threatening comorbid conditions."
"What are effective treatments for oppositional defiant behaviors in adolescents
To determine by meta-analysis the effect size for stimulants on overt and covert aggression-related behaviors in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), separately from stimulant effects on the core symptoms of ADHD. A review of the literature from 1970 to 2001 revealed 28 studies meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria for meta-analysis. These studies yielded 28 independent effects of overt aggression and 7 independent effects of covert aggression. The overall weighted mean effect size was 0.84 for overt and 0.69 for covert aggression related behaviors in ADHD. Comorbid conduct disorder is associated with diminishing stimulant effect size for overt aggression. Stimulant effects for aggression-related behaviors in ADHD have effect sizes similar to those for the core symptoms of ADHD.","A meta-analysis evaluated 28 studies of stimulant medication (methylphenidate, amphetamine, or pemoline) for children with comorbid attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and ODD. A total of 683 patients aged 8 to 18 years were included. Stimulants reduced aggression-related behaviors in these children by an effect size of 0.84 for overt aggression and 0.69 for covert aggression. Stimulants typically reduce aggressive behaviors by similar effect sizes when prescribed for children with attention deficit disorder alone. The study groups did not separate children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and oppositional defiant disorder from those with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and conduct disorder; they also grouped adolescents together with younger children."
"What is the best way to evaluate an acute traumatic knee injury
To define the accuracy (compared with magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) of sonographic examination in detecting knee effusion and to determine whether the presence of knee effusions in patients with traumatic knee injury can predict knee internal derangement as assessed by MRI. Prospective study. Hospital rehabilitation department. Thirty patients (19 men, 11 women) with traumatic knee injury were recruited. Subjects received sonographic examination and MRI on the same day. Not applicable. The presence or absence of knee effusion was assessed by sonographic examination. MRI was used as criterion standard to evaluate whether the presence of knee effusion and internal derangement, which included tear of anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments, as well as meniscus tear. The sensitivity of sonographic examination for detecting knee effusion was 79.1%, and specificity was 50%. The positive-predictive value (PPV) was 86.3% and negative-predictive value (NPV) was 37.5%. The PPV of sonographic effusion to internal derangement was 90.9%, and the NPV was 37.5%. Sonographic examination can accurately detect effusion of the knee. The detection of knee effusion in patients with traumatic knee injury by sonographic examination is highly indicative of internal knee derangement.","In a small nonrandomized study of adult knee trauma, sonographic diagnosis of an effusion (by an expert) had an LR+ for diagnosing an internal derangement of the knee of 2.0 (95% CI, 0.67-5.96) and an LR- of 0.33 (95% CI, 0.12-0.96), as compared with the gold standard of MRI."
"Should the varicella vaccine be given to all children to prevent chickenpox
We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled efficacy trial of the live attenuated Oka/Merck varicella vaccine among 956 children between the ages of 1 and 14 years, with a negative clinical history of varicella. Of the 914 children who were serologically confirmed to be susceptible to varicella, 468 received vaccine and 446 received placebo. The vaccine produced few clinical reactions and was well tolerated. There was no clinical evidence of viral spread from vaccinated children to sibling controls. Approximately eight weeks after vaccination, 94 per cent of the initially seronegative children who received vaccine had detectable antibody to varicella. During the nine-month surveillance period, 39 clinically diagnosed cases of varicella, 38 of which were confirmed by laboratory tests, occurred among study participants. All 39 cases occurred in placebo recipients; no child who received vaccine contracted varicella. The vaccine was 100 per cent efficacious in preventing varicella in this population of healthy children (P less than 10(-9).","In children aged 10 months to 14 years, 1 randomized controlled trial found protective efficacy of 100% over 9 months and 98% over 7 years."
"When is it OK for children to start drinking fruit juice
The obesity epidemic in the United States continues to increase. Because obesity tends to track over time, the increase in overweight among young children is of significant concern. A number of eating patterns have been associated with overweight among preschool-aged children. Recently, 100% fruit juice and sweetened fruit drinks have received considerable attention as potential sources of high-energy beverages that could be related to the prevalence of obesity among young children. Our aim was to evaluate the beverage intake among preschool children who participated in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2002 and investigate associations between types and amounts of beverages consumed and weight status in preschool-aged children. We performed a secondary analysis of the data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2002, which is a continuous, cross-sectional survey of a nationally representative sample of the noninstitutionalized population of the United States. It included the collection of parent reported demographic descriptors, a 24-hour dietary recall, a measure of physical activity, and a standardized physical examination. The 24-hour dietary recall was obtained in person by a trained interviewer and reflected the foods and beverages that were consumed by the participant the previous day. The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey food groups were classified on the basis of the US Department of Agriculture's Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies. We reviewed the main food descriptors used and classified all beverages listed. One hundred percent fruit juice was classified as only beverages that contained 100% fruit juice, without sweetener. Fruit drinks included any sweetened fruit juice, fruit-flavored drink (natural or artificial), or drink that contained fruit juice in part. Milk included any type of cow milk and then was subcategorized by percentage of milk fat. Any sweetened soft drink, caffeinated or uncaffeinated, was categorized as soda. Diet drinks included any fruit drink, tea, or soda that was sweetened by low-calorie sweetener. Several beverages were removed from the analysis because of low frequency of consumption among the sample. Water was not included in the analysis because it is not part of the US Department of Agriculture's Food and Nutrient Database categories. For the purposes of this analysis, the beverages were converted and reported as ounces, rather than grams, as reported by the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, to make it more clinically relevant. The child's BMI percentile for age and gender were calculated on the basis of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria and used to identify children's weight status as underweight (< 5%), normal weight (5% to < 85%), at risk for overweight (85% to < 95%), or overweight (> or = 95%). Because of the small number of children in the underweight category, they were included in the normal-weight category for this analysis. Data were analyzed using SUDAAN 9.0.1 statistical software programs. SUDAAN allows for improved accuracy and validity of results by calculating test statistics for the stratified, multistage probability design of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Sample weights were applied to all analyses to account for unequal probability of selection from oversampling low-income children and black and Mexican American children. Descriptive and chi2 analyses and analysis of covariance, adjusting for age, gender, ethnicity, household income, energy intake, and physical activity, were conducted. All children who were aged 2 to 5 years were identified (N = 1572). Those with missing data were removed from additional analysis, resulting in a final sample of 1160 preschool children. Of the 1160 children analyzed, 579 (49.9%) were male. White children represented 35%, black children represented 28.3%, and Hispanic children represented 36.7% of the sample. Twenty-four percent of the children were overweight or at risk for overweight (BMI > or = 85%), and 10.7% were overweight (BMI > or = 95%). There were no statistically significant differences in BMI between boys and girls or among the ethnicities. Overweight children tended to be older (mean age: 3.83 years) compared with the normal-weight children (mean age: 3.48 years). Eighty-three percent of children drank milk, 48% drank 100% fruit juice, 44% drank fruit drink, and 39% drank soda. Whole milk was consumed by 46.5% of the children, and 3.1% and 5.5% of the children consumed skim milk and 1% milk, respectively. Preschool children consumed a mean total beverage volume of 26.93 oz/day, which included 12.32 oz of milk, 4.70 oz of 100% fruit juice, 4.98 oz of fruit drinks, and 3.25 oz of soda. Weight status of the child had no association with the amount of total beverages, milk, 100% fruit juice, fruit drink, or soda consumed. There was no clinically significant association between the types of milk (percentage of fat) consumed and weight status. In analysis of covariance, daily total energy intake increased with increased consumption of milk, 100% fruit juice, fruit drinks, and soda. However, there was not a statistically significant increase in BMI on the basis of quantity of milk, 100% fruit juice, fruit drink, or soda consumed. On average, preschool children drank less milk than the 2005 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommendation of 16 oz/day. Only 8.6% drank low-fat or skim milk, as recommended for children who are older than 2 years. On average, preschool children drank < 6 oz/day 100% fruit juice. Increased beverage consumption was associated with an increase in the total energy intake of the children but not with their BMI. Prospectively studying preschool children beyond 2 to 5 years of age, through their adiposity rebound (approximately 5.5-6 years) to determine whether there is a trajectory increase in their BMI, may help to clarify the role of beverage consumption in total energy intake and weight status.",Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) suggest that overweight children and adolescents consume more sugar-sweetened beverages than those who are not overweight.
"Which complementary therapies can help patients with PMS
Conflicting data exist regarding the presence of magnesium (Mg) deficiency and the therapeutic efficacy of Mg in premenstrual syndrome or premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). The % Mg retention was determined using 24-hour urinary Mg excretion and the total dose of Mg given intravenously. In women with (n = 17) and without (n = 14) prospectively diagnosed PMDD, several blood measures of Mg and mood were obtained before, immediately after, and the day following an intravenous Mg (.1 mmol/kg) loading dose. A positive mood response was seen under open conditions; as open Mg infusion improved mood, subsequent PMDD patients (n = 10) were randomized in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover fashion. Patients (31.5%) and control subjects (27.5%) retained comparable mean percentages of Mg. Neither group differed in measures of mean Mg before, immediately after, or the day following Mg infusion. Although there was a time effect for all mood measures in the patient group (p < .01 for all), there was neither a treatment nor time-by-treatment effect. Contrary to prior reports, we found no evidence of Mg deficiency in women with PMDD compared with control subjects. Furthermore, Mg was not superior to placebo in the mitigation of mood symptoms in women with PMDD.","A study, begun as an open trial of magnesium infusion for premenstrual dysphoric disorder (N=6), found a dramatic reduction in mood symptom scores. After converting to a randomized, blinded design (N=10), no difference was found compared with placebo."
"What is the best medical therapy for new-onset type 2 diabetes
Metformin is an anti-hyperglycaemic agent used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Type 2 diabetes may present long-term complications: micro- (retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy) and macrovascular (stroke, myocardial infarction and peripheral vascular disease). Two meta-analyses have been published before, although only secondary outcomes were assessed. To assess the effects of metformin monotherapy on mortality, morbidity, quality of life, glycaemic control, body weight, lipid levels, blood pressure, insulinaemia, and albuminuria in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Studies were obtained from computerised searches of multiple electronic databases and hand searches of reference lists of relevant trials identified. Date of last search: September 2003. Trials fulfilling the following inclusion criteria: Diabetes mellitus type 2, metformin versus any other oral intervention, assessment of relevant clinical outcome measures, use of random allocation. Two reviewers extracted data, using a standard data extraction form. Data were summarised under a random effects model. Dichotomous data were expressed as relative risk. We calculated the risk difference (RD), and the Number Needed to Treat, when it was possible. We collected data of mean and standard deviation from changes to baseline. However many trials reported end point data. This limitation lead to the expression of the results as standardised mean differences (SMD) and an overall SMD was calculated. Heterogeneity was tested for using the Z score and the I-squared statistic. Subgroup, sensitivity analysis and meta-regression were used to explore heterogeneity. We included for analysis 29 trials with 37 arms (5259 participants), comparing metformin (37 arms and 2007 participants) with sulphonylureas (13 and 1167), placebo (12 and 702), diet (three and 493), thiazolidinediones (three and 132), insulin (two and 439), meglitinides (two and 208), and glucosidase inhibitors (two and 111). Nine studies reported data on primary outcomes. Obese patients allocated to intensive blood glucose control with metformin showed a greater benefit than chlorpropamide, glibenclamide, or insulin for any diabetes-related outcomes (P = 0.009), and for all-cause mortality (P = 0.03). Obese participants assigned to intensive blood glucose control with metformin showed a greater benefit than overweight patients on conventional treatment for any diabetes-related outcomes (P = 0.004), diabetes-related death (P = 0.03), all-cause mortality (P = 0.01), and myocardial infarction (P = 0.02). Patients assigned to metformin monotherapy showed a significant benefit for glycaemia control, weight, dyslipidaemia, and diastolic blood pressure. Metformin presents a strong benefit for HbA1c when compared with placebo and diet; and a moderated benefit for: glycaemia control, LDL cholesterol, and BMI or weight when compared with sulphonylureas. Metformin may be the first therapeutic option in the diabetes mellitus type 2 with overweight or obesity, as it may prevent some vascular complications, and mortality. Metformin produces beneficial changes in glycaemia control, and moderated in weight, lipids, insulinaemia and diastolic blood pressure. Sulphonylureas, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, thiazolidinediones, meglitinides, insulin, and diet fail to show more benefit for glycaemia control, body weight, or lipids, than metformin.","A meta-analysis of head-to-head studies involving metformin showed equal efficacy compared with injected insulin (2 trials, 811 participants), Α-glucosidase inhibitors (2 trials, 223 participants), and non-sulfonylurea secretagogues (2 trials, 413 participants)."
"Do antibiotics interfere with the efficacy of oral contraceptives
With the exception of rifampin-like drugs, there is a lack of scientific evidence supporting the ability of commonly prescribed antibiotics, including all those routinely employed in outpatient dentistry, to either reduce blood levels and/or the effectiveness of oral contraceptives. To date, all clinical trials studying the effects of concomitant antibiotic therapy (with the exception of rifampin and rifabutin) have failed to demonstrate an interaction. Like all drugs, oral contraceptives are not 100% effective with the failure rate in the typical United States population reported to be as high as 3%. It is thus possible that the case reports of unintended pregnancies during antibiotic therapy may simply represent the normal failure rate of these drugs. Considering that both drug classes are prescribed frequently to women of childbearing potential, one would expect a much higher rate of oral contraceptive failure in this group of patients if a true drug:drug interaction existed. On the other hand, if the interaction does exist but is a relatively rare event, occurring in, say, 1 in 5000 women, clinical studies such as those described in this article would not detect the interaction. The pharmacokinetic studies of simultaneous antibiotic and oral contraceptive ingestion, and the retrospective studies of pregnancy rates among oral contraceptive users exposed to antibiotics, all suffer from one potential common weakness, i.e., their relatively small sample size. Sample sizes in the pharmacokinetic trials ranged from 7 to 24 participants, whereas the largest retrospective study of pregnancy rates still evaluated less than 800 total contraceptive users. Still, the incidence of such a rare interaction would not differ from the accepted normal failure rate of oral contraceptive therapy. The medico-legal ramifications of what looks like at best a rare interaction remains somewhat ""murky."" On one hand, we have medico-legal experts advising the profession to exercise caution and warn all oral contraceptive users of a potential reduction in efficacy during antibiotic therapy. These opinions are not evidence-based and rely heavily on one or two legal proceedings that cannot even be substantiated. On the other hand, there is one recently published legal proceeding in which the outcome was in favor of the oral surgeon. There is clearly a need for additional scientific research in oral contraceptive users that incorporates larger sample sizes, different time courses (prophylactic use versus standard 7-10 day use versus extended use), and different delivery systems (systemic administration versus local-controlled delivery) of antibiotic therapy. Though experts on this topic still recommend informing oral contraceptive users of the potential for a rare interaction, and for clinicians to advise them to employ additional barrier techniques of birth control during antibiotic therapy and for at least 1 week beyond the last dose [40], it is hoped that a set of guidelines regarding this controversy will eventually be published that is evidence-based, and not solely the results of anecdotal reports, expert opinions, and legal proceedings.","It is possible, however, that a true interaction between antibiotics and OCs may only manifest itself in the very small subset of women who have unusually low steroid hormone levels. These women may be identified by symptoms of breakthrough bleeding, cramping, nausea, vomiting or diarrhea, or by unwanted pregnancy."
"What is the most effective treatment for external genital warts
60 patients with first-episode perianal condylomata acuminata were randomly assigned to podophyllin application or surgical excision. 58% of the male patients were homosexual and 33% of the female patients regularly had anal intercourse. Podophyllin completely cleared warts from 23 of 30 (76.6%) patients compared with 28 of 30 (93.3%) for surgical excision. After wart clearance the cumulative recurrence rates were 18% for surgical excision and 43% for podophyllin at 3 months (p less than 0.05), 22% and 56% at 6 months (p less than 0.01), 26% and 56% at 9 months (p less than 0.01), and 29% and 65% at 12 months (p less than 0.01). All patients were treated as outpatients and all surgical procedures were carried out under local anaesthesia. Both regimens were well tolerated.","Although surgical treatments have not been compared with placebo or no treatment, both electrosurgery and surgical excision are superior to podophyllin in clinical trials. This randomized controlled trials showed more frequent recurrence with podophyllin (60% to 65%) than with surgical excision (19% to 20%)."
"Do acetaminophen and an nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs combined relieve osteoarthritis pain better than either alone
To perform a randomized, double-blind, crossover clinical trial of diclofenac + misoprostol versus acetaminophen in ambulatory patients with osteoarthritis of the hip or knee. Patients in 12 ambulatory care settings were eligible if they were age >40 years and if they had Kellgren/Lawrence radiographic grade 2-4 osteoarthritis of the knee or hip and a score of > or =30 mm on a 100-mm visual analog pain scale. Patients were randomized to one of two groups, 75 mg diclofenac + 200 microg misoprostol twice daily or 1,000 mg acetaminophen 4 times daily (each for 6 weeks), and were then crossed over to the other treatment for 6 weeks. A placebo was included in each treatment regimen to enable double blinding. The primary outcome measures were the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index and the visual analog pain scale of the Multidimensional Health Assessment Questionnaire. Safety was assessed using a standard form to review adverse events. We enrolled 227 patients, of whom 218 provided data for the first treatment period and 181 provided data for both treatment periods. Significantly higher levels of improvement in the primary outcomes were seen for diclofenac + misoprostol than for acetaminophen (P < 0.001). Adverse events were more common when patients took diclofenac + misoprostol (P = 0.046). Diclofenac + misoprostol was rated as ""better"" or ""much better"" by 57% of the 174 patients who provided such ratings for both treatment periods, while acetaminophen was rated as ""better"" or ""much better"" by 20% of these patients, and 22% reported no difference (P < 0.001). Differences favoring diclofenac + misoprostol over acetaminophen were greater in patients with more severe osteoarthritis according to baseline pain scores, radiographs, or number of involved joints. Patients with osteoarthritis of the hip or knee had significantly greater improvements in pain scores over 6 weeks with diclofenac + misoprostol than with acetaminophen, although patients with mild osteoarthritis had similar improvements with both drugs. Acetaminophen was associated with fewer adverse events.",A 6-week randomized double-blind crossover trial of 227 patients comparing 75 mg diclofenac and 200 mg misoprostol (Arthrotec) with acetaminophen 4 g/d found the diclofenac-misoprostol combination provided more pain control than acetaminophen alone. Adverse events were slightly more common in the diclofenac group (54% vs 46%; P=.046).
"What is the best medical therapy for new-onset type 2 diabetes
Care of patients with type 2 diabetes has been revolutionized throughout the past several years-first, by the realization of the importance of tight glycemic control in forestalling complications, and second, by the availability of several unique classes of oral antidiabetic agents. Deciphering which agent to use in certain clinical situations is a new dilemma facing the primary care physician. To systematically review available data from the literature regarding the efficacy of oral antidiabetic agents, both as monotherapy and in combination. A MEDLINE search was performed to identify all English-language reports of unique, randomized controlled clinical trials involving recently available oral agents for type 2 diabetes. Bibliographies were also reviewed to find additional reports not otherwise identified. Studies (63) were included in the analysis if they had a study period of at least 3 months; if each group contained at least 10 subjects at the study's conclusion; and if hemoglobin A(1c) was reported. When multiple dosages of a drug were tested, the results of the highest approved dosage were used. In placebo-controlled trials, hemoglobin A(1c) data are presented as the difference between the change in treated vs placebo subjects. Five distinct oral drug classes are now available for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Compared with placebo treatment, most of these agents lower hemoglobin A(1c) levels approximately 1% to 2%. Equivalent efficacy is usually demonstrated when different agents are compared with one another in the same study population. When they are used in combination, there are additional glycemic benefits. Long-term vascular risk reduction has been demonstrated only with sulfonylureas and metformin. With few exceptions, the available oral antidiabetic agents are equally effective at lowering glucose concentrations. Their mechanisms of action are different, however, and as a result they appear to have distinct metabolic effects. These are reflected in their adverse effect profiles and their effect on cardiovascular risk, which may influence drug choice.","A systematic review with 22 RCTs (total n=7370), ranging in length from 12 weeks to 3 years, compared 2 oral agents with a single oral agent or placebo. Combinations of oral agents produced statistically significant additional improvement in HbA1c in 21 of 22 studies. The magnitude of this effect across the studies was on the order of a 1% change in HbA1c, although the data were not subject to a formal meta-analysis."
"What is the best treatment for gastroesophageal reflux and vomiting in infants
The effect of metoclopramide on gastroesophageal reflux was studied in 30 infants less than 1 year of age. Gastroesophageal reflux was documented in all infants by extended pH monitoring before enrollment in the study. Patients were randomly assigned to receive metoclopramide 0.1 mg/kg or placebo four times a day, 1/2 hour before feeding for 1 week, followed by the alternate regimen for 1 week. The infants were reevaluated with extended pH monitoring and scintigraphy after 4 to 7 days of each treatment. A symptom score was derived by determining the average number of occurrences of all symptoms recorded daily by parents on a symptom checklist during pretreatment, placebo, and metoclopramide treatment periods. There was a difference between pretreatment evaluation and placebo periods with respect to daily symptom scores (p less than 0.005), reflecting a significant placebo response. However, no difference in scintigraphic study was found between placebo and metoclopramide periods. A significant difference between placebo and metoclopramide periods was noted in the percentage of time esophageal pH was less than 4.0 (p less than 0.001). However, although metoclopramide decreased the proportion of time esophageal pH was less than 4.0, pH remained less than 4.0 for more than 5% of the time in most patients. Substratification of the total group into infants younger and older than 3 months revealed that older infants had greater average daily weight gain during the metoclopramide treatment period (34.3 gm/day) than in the placebo treatment period (6.6 gm/day, p = 0.05). We conclude that metoclopramide in the dosage 0.1 mg/kg four times daily reduces reflux in infants and may be useful for infants with poor weight gain and other serious complications of gastroesophageal reflux.","A small randomized controlled trials of metoclopramide shows significant improvement in reflux index measured by pH probe. However, metoclopramide yielded no improvement in symptom counts."
"How should we treat major depression combined with anxiety
Anxiety frequently coexists with depression. Adding benzodiazepines to antidepressants is commonly used to treat people with depression, although there has been no convincing evidence to show that such a combination is more effective than antidepressants alone and that there are suggestions that benzodiazepines may lose their efficacy with long-term administration and that their chronic use carries risks of dependence. To determine whether, among adult patients with major depression, adding benzodiazepines to antidepressants brings about any benefit in terms of symptomatic recovery or side-effects in the short term (less than 8 weeks) and long term (more than 2 months), in comparison with treatment by antidepressants alone. We searched MEDLINE (1972 to September 1997), EMBASE (1980 to September 1997), International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1972 to September 1997), Biological Abstracts (1984 to September 1997), LILACS (1980 to September 1997), PsycLIT (1974 to September 1997), the Cochrane Library (issue 3, 1997) and the trial register of the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group (last searched March 1999), combined with hand searching, reference searching, SciSearch and personal contacts. All randomised controlled trials that compared combined antidepressant-benzodiazepine treatment with antidepressant alone for adult patients with major depression. Exclusion criteria are: antidepressant dosage lower than 100 mg of imipramine or its equivalent daily and duration of trial shorter than four weeks. Two reviewers independently assessed the eligibility and quality of the studies. Two reviewers independently extracted the data. Standardized weighted mean differences and relative risks were estimated with random effects model. The dropouts were assigned the least favourable outcome. Two sensitivity analyses examined the effect of this assumption as well as the effect of including medium quality studies. Three a priori subgroup analyses were performed with regard to the patients with or without comorbid anxiety and with regard to the type. Aggregating nine studies with a total of 679 patients, the combination therapy group was less likely to drop out than the antidepressant alone group (relative risk 0.63, 95% confidence interval 0.49 to 0.81). The intention-to-treat analysis (with people dropping out assigned the least favourable outcome) showed that the combination group was more likely to show improvement in their depression (defined as 50% or greater reduction in the depression scale from baseline) (relative risk 1.63, 95% confidence interval 1.18 to 2.27 at one week and relative risk 1.38, 95% confidence interval 1.15 to 1.66 at four weeks). The difference was no longer significant at six to eight weeks. None of the included RCTs lasted longer than eight weeks. The patients allocated to the combination therapy were less likely to drop out from the treatment due to side effects than those receiving antidepressants alone (relative risk 0.53, 95% confidence interval 0.32 to 0.86). However, these two groups of patients were equally likely to report at least one side effect (relative risk 0.99, 95% confidence interval 0.92 to 1.07). The potential benefits of adding a benzodiazepine to an antidepressant must be balanced judiciously against possible harms including development of dependence and accident proneness, on the one hand, and against continued suffering following no response and drop-out, on the other.","A Cochrane systematic review (10 RCTs, N=731) compared antidepressants alone vs combinations with benzodiazepines for patients with major depression and a 35% to 85% estimated prevalence of anxiety symptoms. Three studies used standardized scales to measure anxiety symptom severity. Antidepressants in combination with benzodiazepines were more likely than antidepressants alone to reduce depression scores by 50% or more (for 50% depression improvement at 1 week, number needed to treat [NNT]=12; at 4 weeks, NNT=8). The combination group also had fewer dropouts (relative risk [RR]=0.63, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.49-0. 81). The authors concluded that potential benefits of adding a benzodiazepine to an antidepressant must be balanced against possible harms, such as the development of dependence."
"What causes a low thyroid-stimulating hormone level with a normal free T4 level
Examination of thyroxine usage in a study in the United States of America revealed that many patients were prescribed thyroxine for non-thyroid indications, such as obesity and fatigue. Many of those receiving thyroxine had high or low serum thyroid stimulating hormone levels, indicating prescription of incorrect doses or lack of patient compliance with therapy. Long term thyroxine therapy may have effects upon the risk of osteoporosis. The aims of this study were to investigate indications for thyroxine prescription in the United Kingdom and to examine the frequency of abnormal serum thyroid stimulating hormone concentrations in those prescribed thyroxine for hypothyroidism. This was in order to determine the relevance of measurement of thyroid stimulating hormone level in monitoring thyroxine therapy. Subjects receiving thyroxine were identified from the computerized prescribing records of four general practices in the West Midlands. Of 18,944 patients registered, 146 (0.8%) were being prescribed thyroxine; 134 of these had primary hypothyroidism and the remainder had other thyroid or pituitary diseases prior to treatment. Of the 97 patients with primary hypothyroidism who agreed to have their thyroid stimulating hormone level measured, abnormal serum levels were found in 48%, high levels in 27% and low levels in 21%. There was a significant relationship between prescribed thyroxine dose and median serum thyroid stimulating hormone level: high hormone levels were found in 47% of those prescribed less than 100 micrograms thyroxine per day, while low levels were found in 24% of those prescribed 100 micrograms or more. Thus, thyroxine prescription was common in the four practices sampled, although indications for its use were appropriate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",It is worth noting that individuals treated with levothyroxine have a prevalence of iatrogenic subclinical hypothyroidism from 14% to 21%.
"What's the best strategy for bipolar disorder during pregnancy
The chronic, complex, and episodic course of bipolar mood disorder presents a particularly formidable challenge to the clinician making a treatment plan for the onset or recurrence of the illness during pregnancy and lactation. Women treated with anti-manic drugs who become pregnant are commonly considered to be at high risk for fetal complications during the pregnancy or during lactation. The risks of antimanic drug use during pregnancy include teratogenic effects, direct neonatal toxicity, and the potential for longer-term neurobehavioral sequela. The use of medications during pregnancy and lactation requires critical attention to the timing of exposure, dosage, duration of use, and fetal susceptibility. The postnatal period is a time of increased onset and relapse of mental illness. No antimanic drug can be proven completely safe. Prescribing antimanic medications with a long safety record, avoiding exposure in the first trimester; avoiding multidrug regimens, and prescribing the lowest dose for the shortest duration will minimize the fetal risk. This review considers treatment with lithium, valproic acid, and carbamazepine. It assesses the risk to the fetus, the perinatal risks for the infant, the risks associated with treatment during the puerperium and breast-feeding, and the risks to the later development of the child.","The most common complication, occurring in 1.5% of cases, were fetal arrhythmias. Avoiding atropine, maintaining oxygenation, avoiding excessive hyperventilation, and elevating the right hip can decrease the risk of fetal arrhythmias during electroconvulsive therapy."
"What is the role of prokinetic agents for constipation
Oral erythromycin prolongs cardiac repolarization and is associated with case reports of torsades de pointes. Because erythromycin is extensively metabolized by cytochrome P-450 3A (CYP3A) isozymes, commonly used medications that inhibit the effects of CYP3A may increase plasma erythromycin concentrations, thereby increasing the risk of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death. We studied the association between the use of erythromycin and the risk of sudden death from cardiac causes and whether this risk was increased with the concurrent use of strong inhibitors of CYP3A. We studied a previously identified Tennessee Medicaid cohort that included 1,249,943 person-years of follow-up and 1476 cases of confirmed sudden death from cardiac causes. The CYP3A inhibitors used in the study were nitroimidazole antifungal agents, diltiazem, verapamil, and troleandomycin; each doubles, at least, the area under the time-concentration curve for a CYP3A substrate. Amoxicillin, an antimicrobial agent with similar indications but which does not prolong cardiac repolarization, and former use of erythromycin also were studied, to assess possible confounding by indication. The multivariate adjusted rate of sudden death from cardiac causes among patients currently using erythromycin was twice as high (incidence-rate ratio, 2.01; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.08 to 3.75; P=0.03) as that among those who had not used any of the study antibiotic medications. There was no significant increase in the risk of sudden death among former users of erythromycin (incidence-rate ratio, 0.89; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.72 to 1.09; P=0.26) or among those who were currently using amoxicillin (incidence-rate ratio, 1.18; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.59 to 2.36; P=0.65). The adjusted rate of sudden death from cardiac causes was five times as high (incidence-rate ratio, 5.35; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.72 to 16.64; P=0.004) among those who concurrently used CYP3A inhibitors and erythromycin as that among those who had used neither CYP3A inhibitors nor any of the study antibiotic medications. In contrast, there was no increase in the risk of sudden death among those who concurrently used amoxicillin and CYP3A inhibitors or those currently using any of the study antibiotic medications who had formerly used CYP3A inhibitors. The concurrent use of erythromycin and strong inhibitors of CYP3A should be avoided.","The erythromycin dose used in these studies was lower than the dosage for antibiotic purposes; no adverse effects were reported. However, cardiac arrhythmias and death have occurred when erythromycin is given to adults and children at the usual antibiotic doses."
"What are the most effective treatments for bacterial vaginosis in nonpregnant women
To evaluate the treatment of bacterial vaginosis with metronidazole to determine if there is a therapeutic regimen that is superior to all others with regard to cure and recurrence rates. Computer-assisted literature search, Medical Subject Index review, and references cited in articles identified. Clinical trials comparing different oral metronidazole regimens in which diagnostic criteria for bacterial vaginosis and criteria to detect cure to treatment were described. Articles that met inclusion criteria were critically appraised and those that passed were included in the analysis. Of 52 initial articles, 10 met criteria for inclusion and passed critical appraisal. Patients were divided in groups according to the duration of therapy received: group A (n = 413), 2-g single dose; group B (n = 193), 2-g single daily dose for 2 days; group C (n = 317), 5 days; and group D (n = 280), 7 days. Cure rates on initial evaluation for the groups were 85%, 87%, 86%, and 87%, respectively. chi 2 Contingency table analysis showed no significant difference in cure rates among the groups (P = .78). Only 465 of these patients were evaluated for recurrence of disease. There was no significant difference in cure rates after 4 weeks of therapy (P = .4). A 2-g single-dose metronidazole regimen is as effective as a single daily dose given for 2 days or a 5-day course or a 7-day course.",A meta-analysis of 10 clinical trials compared different dosing regimens of oral metronidazole. The results showed comparable cure rates (85% to 87%) among groups treated with either a single 2-g dose or 500 mg twice daily for 7 days.
"What nonpharmacological treatments are effective against common nongenital warts
Viral warts caused by the human papilloma virus represent one of the most common diseases of the skin. Any area of skin can be affected although the hands and feet are by far the commonest sites. A very wide range of local treatments are available. To assess the effects of different local treatments for cutaneous, non-genital warts in healthy people. We searched the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (January 2003), the Skin Group trials register (January 2003), MEDLINE (1966 to January 2003), EMBASE (1980 to January 2003) and a number of other key biomedical and health economics databases. In addition the cited references of all trials identified and key review articles were searched. Pharmaceutical companies involved in local treatments for warts and experts in the field were contacted. The most recent searches were carried Randomised controlled trials of local treatments for cutaneous non-genital viral warts in immunocompetent human hosts were included. Study selection and assessment of methodological quality were carried out by two independent reviewers. Fifty two trials were identified which fulfilled the criteria for inclusion in the review. The evidence provided by these studies was generally weak because of poor methodology and reporting. In 17 trials with placebo groups that used participants as the unit of analysis the average cure rate of placebo preparations was 30% (range 0 to 73%) after an average period of 10 weeks (range 4 to 24 weeks). The best available evidence was for simple topical treatments containing salicylic acid, which are clearly better than placebo. Data pooled from six placebo-controlled trials show a cure rate of 144/191 (75%) compared with 89/185 (48%) in controls, odds ratio 3.91 (95% confidence interval 2.40 to 6.36), random effects model. Most of the bigger trials of cryotherapy studied different regimens rather than comparing cryotherapy with other treatments or placebo. Pooled data from two small trials that included cryotherapy and placebo or no treatment, showed no significant difference in cure rates. In two trials comparing cryotherapy with salicylic acid and one comparing duct tape with cryotherapy no significant difference in efficacy was demonstrated. There was no consistent evidence for the effectiveness of intralesional bleomycin. Four studies, using warts rather than individuals as the unit of analysis, had widely varying results which could not be meaningfully pooled. There was some evidence for the efficacy of dinitrochlorobenzene, a potent contact sensitizer. Pooled data from two small studies comparing dinitrochlorobenzene with placebo showed cure rates of 32/40 (80%) and 15/40 (38%) respectively, odds ratio 6.67 (95% confidence interval 2.44 to 18.23), random effects model. Only limited evidence was found for the efficacy of topical 5-fluorouracil, intralesional interferons and photodynamic therapy.Bleomycin, dinitrochlorobenzene, 5-fluorouracil, interferons and photodynamic therapy are potentially hazardous or toxic treatments. There is a considerable lack of evidence on which to base the rational use of the local treatments for common warts. The reviewed trials are highly variable in method and quality. Cure rates with placebo preparations are variable but nevertheless considerable. There is certainly evidence that simple topical treatments containing salicylic acid have a therapeutic effect. There is less evidence for the efficacy of cryotherapy and some evidence that it is only of equivalent efficacy to simpler, safer treatments. Dinitrochlorobenzene appears to be effective but there were no statistically significant differences when compared with the safer, simpler and cheaper topical treatments containing salicylic acid. The benefits and risks of 5-fluorouracil, bleomycin, interferons and photodynamic therapy remain to be determined.","Seventeen studies of cryotherapy with between 30 and 400 patients show cure rates ranging from 29% to 87%, although most did not have placebo arms. Pooled data from 69 patients in 2 small studies did not show a benefit between the cryotherapy and nontreatment arms, although there were very low cure rates from cryotherapy in 1 study and high spontaneous remission rates in the other."
"Does physical therapy improve symptoms of fibromyalgia
Fibromyalgia (FMS) is a syndrome expressed by chronic widespread body pain which leads to reduced physical function and frequent use of health care services. Exercise training is commonly recommended as a treatment. The objective of this systematic review was to examine the efficacy of exercise training as an treatment for FMS. We searched 6 electronic bibliographies for studies of exercise training in FMS: MEDLINE (1966-12/2000), CINAHL (1982-12/2000), HealthSTAR (1990-12/2000), Sports Discus (1975-05/2000), EMBASE (1974-05/2000) and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (2000, issue 4). We also reviewed the reference lists from identified articles including reviews and meta-analyses of treatment studies. Randomized trials focused on cardiorespiratory endurance, muscle strength and/or flexibility as treatment for FMS were selected. Two reviewers independently identified trials meeting inclusion criteria, rated the methodologic quality using 2 standardized validated instruments, evaluated the adequacy of the exercise training stimulus using the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) criteria and evaluated the results. Disagreements were resolved through active discussion and consensus. High quality training studies had scores of 50% or greater on van Tulder methodologic criteria and met the minimum training standards of ACSM. Outcome variables were grouped into 7 constructs: pain, tender points, physical function, global well being, self efficacy, fatigue & sleep, and psychological function. Two reviewers independently extracted data on study characteristics, results and point estimates for selected variables, and used consensus to address discrepancies. Sixteen trials involving a total of 724 participants were assigned at random to: exercise intervention groups (n=379), control groups (n=277), or groups receiving an alternate treatment (n=68). Seven studies were high quality training studies: 4 aerobic training, 1 a mixture of aerobic, strength and flexibility training, 1 strength training and 2 with exercise training as part of a composite treatment. Flexibility protocols were never described in sufficient detail to allow evaluation. The four high quality aerobic training studies reported significantly greater improvements in the exercise groups versus control groups in aerobic performance (17.1% increase in aerobic performance with exercise versus 0.5% increase in the control groups), tender point pain pressure threshold (28.1% increase versus 7.0% decrease) and improvements in pain (11.4% decrease in pain versus 1.6% increase). Poor description of exercise protocols was common, with insufficient information on intensity, duration, frequency and mode of exercise. Adverse events were also poorly reported. Supervised aerobic exercise training has beneficial effects on physical capacity and FMS symptoms. Strength training may also have benefits on some FMS symptoms. Further studies on muscle strengthening and flexibility are needed. Research on the long-term benefit of exercise for FMS is needed.","We examined the results of a systematic review of exercise for treating fibromyalgia. The authors found 7 high-quality studies, 4 of aerobic training, and concluded that supervised aerobic exercise training had beneficial effects on physical capacity, tender-point threshold, and pain. Other investigators have questioned the usefulness of aerobic exercise because long-term benefit remains unclear and compliance is poor."
"When should we screen children for hyperlipidemia
There is now ample evidence to demonstrate that atherosclerosis begins in childhood and is significantly accelerated in certain genetic disorders, most notably familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). Untreated FH, both the homozygous and heterozygous forms, carry a substantial burden of morbidity and mortality if left untreated or inadequately treated. Males with FH are at earlier and greater risk than females and thus should begin therapy earlier, preferably at about 10. While bile acid sequestrants have long been considered the drug of choice in children, they have never been approved for pediatric use by FDA, are poorly tolerated, marginally effective at lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and have minimal well controlled studies in children upon which to adequately assess safety. Over the last decade statins have been studied extensively in children and adolescents, although many of these studies have also been poorly controlled, of short duration, too small and lack detailed assessment. However there has been at least one large, randomized, placebo-controlled and comprehensive study with lovastatin in adolescent males that indicated efficacy similar to that anticipated in adults and no apparent safety concerns. While additional well-controlled studies are needed, especially those focusing on surrogates of atherosclerosis to determine clinical benefit, it is opportune for re-evaluation of current treatment guidelines.","Children with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, an autosomal dominant disorder with a prevalence of 1 in 500, are at increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in adulthood. One quarter of males with familial hyper-cholesterolemia suffer fatal coronary heart disease (CHD) by age 50 years."
"Does breastfeeding protect against viral gastrointestinal infections in children <2 years old
Breastfeeding confers lifesaving protection against infectious illness among disadvantaged populations. As a result, breastfeeding promotion has an important part in child health programs throughout the world. In this article, the evidence regarding the host defense benefits of breastfeeding for term infants of normal birth weight is reviewed, with an emphasis on recent information from industrialized countries regarding how the degree and duration of breastfeeding affect infant health.","A US study showed that risk for rotavirus infection did not differ for infants who were exclusively breastfed, partially breastfed, or exclusively formula-fed. However, the breastfed infants were more likely to have milder symptoms."
"Does psychiatric treatment help patients with intractable chronic pain
To determine the effect of psychoeducational interventions on pain in adults with cancer. 25 intervention studies published from 1978-2001. When analyzed across all studies, a statistically significant, beneficial effect on pain was found. However, threats to validity were present in some studies. The most serious of these involved a lack of random assignment to treatment condition and a floor effect on pain. When limited to the studies with the best methodologic quality, the effect on pain continued to be statistically significant. Effect on pain by type of treatment was examined and found to be somewhat variable and limited by the small number of studies testing each type of treatment. Methodologic quality was variable. Reasonably strong evidence exists for relaxation-based cognitive-behavioral interventions, education about analgesic usage, and supportive counseling. Minimal data were available about the relative effectiveness of different types of psychoeducational interventions because few studies included within-study contrasts of different experimental interventions and usual care was not well documented. Psychoeducational interventions are not a substitute for analgesics, but they may serve as adjuvant therapy. Assessment and clinical judgment are critical. The intervention must be acceptable to patients and not too burdensome for patients in pain to use.","In adults with cancer pain, a recent meta-analysis of 1723 patients showed modest but significant effects on pain from psycho-educational interventions in 25 studies. Although just 3 of the studies lasted 52 weeks or longer, effects were found from good-quality studies for ""relaxation-promoting,"" educational, and supportive counseling plus content therapies."
"When should a chest x-ray be used to evaluate acute-onset productive cough for adults
Cough is the fifth most common reason for physician visits, but data on acute cough have rarely been collected in a standardized manner and have not been analyzed in a multivariate fashion. We report data on 1819 patients presenting with cough, all of whom received a standardized history and physical, and a chest X-ray. Only 48 (2.6%) were found to have an acute radiographic infiltrate (pneumonia). The prevalence of common signs and symptoms is shown for the patients with and without pneumonia. Thirty-two of these findings were significant predictors of pneumonia (p less than 0.05, one-tailed). These 32 did not include some of the expected predictors of pneumonia and did include some predictors not previously described in the literature. A diagnostic rule is developed which identifies pneumonia patients with 91% sensitivity and 40% specificity, or 74% sensitivity and 70% specificity. The study results suggest that many pneumonias could be predicted based only on the patients histories. Physician visits to determine physical findings and chest X-rays might be avoided by telephone triage, with substantial cost savings.","Individual clinical findings such as pulse above 100 beats per minute, respiratory rate above 25 breaths per minute, temperature above 99.9ºF, local dullness to percussion, rales, asymmetric respirations, pleural rubs, egophony, increased fremitus, and cachexia are weak predictors of pneumonia, being present in 4% to 28% of radiographically proven pneumonia. Individual symptoms such as chills, night sweats, fever, and sputum production are found in 31% to 79% of those with pneumonia, but also in 18% to 62% of those without pneumonia. Therefore prediction rules, using combinations of statistically significant factors, have been developed to help us decide when to order a chest x-ray to diagnose pneumonia."
"Which medications can be split without compromising efficacy and safety
The efficacy, safety, and economics of a voluntary conversion from whole simvastatin tablets to split tablets in 6 Veterans Affairs medical centers were retrospectively evaluated in 3,787 patients who received a consistent daily dose (5 to 40 mg) of simvastatin in 1999. Baseline and final low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and average change from baseline were not significantly different between groups (p >0.05), nor were the incidence of transaminase increases (p >0.05) or measurements of patient compliance (p = 0.07). Widespread implementation of this initiative resulted in a cost avoidance of >$1.2 million in the 6 medical centers and $10.3 million across the Veterans Affairs medical system in 1999, with >$46 million avoided in 2003.",A retrospective study of simvastatin evaluated 1098 patients taking whole tablets and 1098 patients converted to split tablets of the same dose. There was no difference in average final low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (111±30 mg/dL vs 112±32 mg/dL) or mean ala-nine aminotransferase (ALT) level.
"How accurate is stress radionuclide imaging for diagnosis of coronary artery disease
This study evaluated the prognostic value of abnormal test results with pharmacologic stress with regard to perioperative and long-term outcomes in a large population of candidates for vascular surgery. Although numerous studies have demonstrated the prognostic value of dipyridamole-thallium-201 myocardial perfusion and dobutamine echocardiography in vascular surgery candidates, a synopsis of predictive estimates is difficult because of individual study variability in pretest clinical risk, sample size and study design. A systematic review of published reports on preoperative pharmacologic stress risk stratification from the MEDLINE data base (1985 to 1994) identified 10 reports on dipyridamole-thallium-201 myocardial perfusion (1,994 patients) and 5 on dobutamine stress echocardiography (446 patients). Random effects models were used to calculate summary odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals. Summary odds ratios for death or myocardial infarction and secondary cardiac end points were greater for dobutamine echocardiographic dyssynergy (14- to 27-fold) than for dipyridamole-thallium-201 redistribution (4-fold); wider confidence intervals were noted with dobutamine echocardiography. Pretest coronary disease probability was correlated with the positive predictive value of a reversible thallium-201 defect (r=0.70), increasing sixfold from low to high risk patient subsets. Cardiac event rates were low in patients without a history of coronary artery disease (1% in 176 patients) compared with patients with coronary disease and a normal or fixed-defect pattern (4.8% in 83 patients) and one or more thallium-201 redistribution abnormality (18.6% in 97 patients, p=0.0001). Meta-analysis of 15 studies demonstrated that the prognostic value of noninvasive stress imaging abnormalities for perioperative ischemic events is comparable between available techniques but that the accuracy varies with coronary artery disease prevalence.","Patient-centered outcomes were reported in a meta-analysis of dipyridamole-thallium imaging in the preoperative evaluation of vascular surgery patients. The summary odds ratio for any perioperative cardiac event (in patients with abnormal tests) was 3.5 (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.5-4.8); the odds ratio for myocardial infarction or cardiac death was 3.9 (95% CI, 2.5-5.6), leading the authors to conclude that there is sound evidence to use radionuclide testing in intermedi.ate-risk patients during preoperative screening."
"What is the best way to treat tinea cruris
Two randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, multicenter studies assessed the efficacy and safety of a new terbinafine 1% solution for the treatment of interdigital tinea pedis and tinea corporis or tinea cruris (tinea corporis/cruris). Patients with interdigital tinea pedis applied terbinafine 1% solution or vehicle twice daily for 1 week with 7 weeks of follow-up (N = 153), and patients with tinea corporis/cruris applied terbinafine 1% solution or vehicle once daily for 1 week with 3 weeks of follow-up (N = 66). Efficacy was assessed mycologically and clinically at the end of treatment and throughout follow-up. In the tinea pedis study, 66% of patients were effectively treated with terbinafine compared with 4% of the group treated by vehicle (P < .001; Mantel-Haenszel test). In the tinea corporis/cruris study, treatment was effective in 65% of the terbinafine group compared with 8% of the vehicle group (P < .001). There were no significant differences in the frequency of cutaneous adverse events between the 2 groups in either study. We conclude that one week of therapy with terbinafine 1% solution is highly effective, superior to vehicle, and safe for use in superficial fungal infections.",A placebo-controlled study of 66 patients demonstrated 100% microscopic cure of terbinafine 1% solution by week 2 and maintaining 90% cure at 4 weeks.
"What are the best therapies for acute migraine in pregnancy
Concerns about the effects of maternal medications on the growing baby limit the use of medication treatment for benign conditions, such as recurring headaches, during pregnancy and lactation. Nonpharmacological therapies hold particular promise for pregnant women due to the limited medication options. No controlled studies, however, have reported on the efficacy of nonpharmacological treatments for pregnant women. The first study evaluated the effectiveness of a combined nonpharmacological treatment (CT) consisting of relaxation, skin-warming biofeedback, and physical therapy for pregnant women with chronic headaches. In a second study, the CT protocol was compared with an attention control (AC) that received headache education and skin-cooling biofeedback. The first study resulted in significant symptom improvement in 79% of subjects, with an overall 72.9% reduction in headaches. In the second study, both groups improved with treatment; however the CT group was more likely to experience significant headache relief (72.7%) than the AC group (28.6%, chi 2(1) = 4.97, p < .03). Significant improvement was maintained at a 6-month follow-up for over 50% of patients. It is concluded that the combined nonpharmacological treatment was more effective than an attention control in reducing headaches during pregnancy. This treatment was effective regardless of predisposing variables.","Two studies were published together evaluating thermal biofeedback, relaxation training, and physical therapy exercises. The first, a cohort study, showed decrease in symptoms for 15 of 19 women. The second, a small randomized controlled trial, compared 11 women using the combination treatment with 14 control women who received attention from the therapist but no other intervention. More than 72% of the treatment arm improved, compared with nearly 29% of the attention control group. Interpretation of these studies is limited by small sample size and testing in settings with specialized resources that are not found in every community."
"Should we recommend universal neonatal hearing screening
Each year, approximately 5000 infants are born in the United States with moderate-to-profound, bilateral permanent hearing loss (PHL). Universal newborn hearing screening (UNHS) has been proposed as a means to speed diagnosis and treatment and thereby improve language outcomes in these children. To identify strengths, weaknesses, and gaps in the evidence supporting UNHS and to compare the additional benefits and harms of UNHS with those of selective screening of high-risk newborns. We searched the MEDLINE, CINAHL, and PsychINFO databases for relevant articles published from 1994 to August 2001, using terms for hearing disorders, infants or newborns, screening, and relevant treatments. We contacted experts and reviewed reference lists to identify additional articles, including those published before 1994. We included controlled and observational studies of (1) the accuracy, yield, and harms of screening using otoacoustic emissions (OAEs), auditory brainstem response (ABR), or both in the general newborn population and (2) the effects of screening or early identification and treatment on language outcomes. Of an original 340 articles identified, 19 articles, including 1 controlled trial, met these inclusion criteria. Data on population, test performance, outcomes, and methodological quality were extracted by 2 authors (D.C.T., H.M.) using prespecified criteria developed by the US Preventive Services Task Force. We queried authors when information needed to assess study quality was missing. Good-quality studies show that from 2041 to 2794 low-risk and 86 to 208 high-risk newborns were screened to find 1 case of moderate-to-profound PHL. The best estimate of positive predictive value was 6.7%. Six percent to 15% of infants who are missed by the screening tests are subsequently diagnosed with bilateral PHL. In a trial of UNHS vs clinical screening at age 8 months, UNHS increased the proportion of infants with moderate-to-severe hearing loss diagnosed by age 10 months (57% vs 14%) but did not reduce the rate of diagnosis after age 18 months. No good-quality controlled study has compared UNHS with selective screening of high-risk newborns. In fair- to poor-quality cohort studies, intervention before age 6 months was associated with improved language and communication skills by ages 2 to 5 years. These studies had unclear criteria for selecting subjects, and none compared an inception cohort of low-risk newborns identified by screening with those identified in usual care, making it impossible to exclude selection bias as an explanation for the results. In a mathematical model based on the literature review, we estimated that extending screening to low-risk infants would detect 1 additional case before age 10 months for every 1441 low-risk infants screened, and result in treatment before 10 months of 1 additional case for every 2401 low-risk infants screened. With UNHS, 254 newborns would be referred for audiological evaluation because of false-positive second-stage screening test results vs 48 for selective screening. Modern screening tests for hearing impairment can improve identification of newborns with PHL, but the efficacy of UNHS to improve long-term language outcomes remains uncertain.","A systematic review gathered studies comparing universal hearing screening with selective screening. Most included studies used a 2-stage universal screening protocol. Infants who failed initial testing were retested within 12 weeks. Testing methods included otoacoustic emissions (OAE) and auditory brainstem response (ABR). Infants who failed the second test were referred for audiological evaluation. Using these data, a hypothetical model was created, which found that 1441 newborns would need to be screened to diagnose 1 additional case of moderate-to-profound permanent hearing loss before 10 months of age (at cost of 200 extra referrals for false-positives). Sensitivity and specificity of the hypothetical model's 2-stage screening was 85% and 97%, respectively. The estimated positive predictive value was 6.7%."
"Should we screen women for hypothyroidism
The indications for treating patients with subclinical hypothyroidism (normal serum thyroxine and free thyroxine levels, but elevated serum thyrotrophin levels) are poorly defined. In this study, 33 patients with subclinical hypothyroidism were randomly assigned in a double-blind manner to receive placebo or L-thyroxine therapy and were followed for 1 year with thyroid function tests, serum lipid measurements, basal metabolic rate and systolic time interval determinations, and a questionnaire on hypothyroid symptoms. The placebo group showed no changes in thyroid function or peripheral indices of thyroid hormone action. In the thyroxine-treated group, serum lipids and the mean systolic time interval did not change, but the systolic time intervals became normal in the 5 patients with the most abnormal baseline values. Symptoms improved in 8 of 14 patients receiving thyroxine and in 3 of 12 patients receiving placebo (p less than 0.05). L-Thyroxine therapy may be useful for patients with subclinical hypothyroidism with abnormal myocardial contractility or symptoms consistent with mild hypothyroidism, or both.",A small randomized controlled trial involving 33 unblinded patients found that those taking thyroid replacement had lower symptom scores (number needed to treat [NNT]=3.5).
"Do COX-2 inhibitors worsen renal function
Adverse effects of selective cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) inhibitors on renal events and arrhythmia have been controversial, with suggestions of a class effect. To quantitatively evaluate adverse risks of renal events (renal dysfunction, hypertension, and peripheral edema) and arrhythmia events and to explore drug class effects and temporal trends of apparent effects of the COX-2 inhibitors: rofecoxib, celecoxib, valdecoxib, parecoxib, etoricoxib, and lumiracoxib. A systematic search of EMBASE and MEDLINE (through June 2006), bibliographies, US Food and Drug Administration reports, and pharmaceutical industry clinical trial databases. From relevant reports, 114 randomized double-blind clinical trials were included. Information on publication year, participant characteristics, trial duration, drug, control, dose, and events were extracted using a standardized protocol. Results were pooled via random-effects models and meta-regressions. Of 116 094 participants from 114 trial reports including 127 trial populations (40 rofecoxib, 37 celecoxib, 29 valdecoxib + parecoxib, 15 etoricoxib, and 6 lumiracoxib), there were a total of 6394 composite renal events (2670 peripheral edema, 3489 hypertension, 235 renal dysfunction) and 286 arrhythmia events. Results indicated significant heterogeneity of renal effects across agents (P for interaction = .02), indicating no class effect. Compared with controls, rofecoxib was associated with increased risk of arrhythmia (relative risk [RR], 2.90; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.07-7.88) and composite renal events (RR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.33-1.76); adverse renal effects increased with greater dose and duration (both P< or =.05). For all individual renal end points, rofecoxib was associated with increased risk of peripheral edema (RR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.23-1.66), hypertension (RR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.29-1.85), and renal dysfunction (RR, 2.31; 95% CI, 1.05-5.07). In contrast, celecoxib was associated with lower risk of both renal dysfunction (RR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.40-0.94) and hypertension (RR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.71-0.97) compared with controls. Other agents were not significantly associated with risk. Time-cumulative analyses indicated that for rofecoxib the adverse risks for peripheral edema and hypertension were evident by the end of year 2000 and for risk of arrhythmia by 2004. In this comprehensive analysis of 114 randomized trials with 116,094 participants, rofecoxib was associated with increased renal and arrhythmia risks. A COX-2 inhibitor class effect was not evident. Future safety monitoring is warranted and may benefit from an active and continuous cumulative surveillance system.","A 2006 meta-analysis, including 114 trials and 116,094 patients randomized to either cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor or control (placebo, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug [NSAID], or mixed), indicated that the COX-2 inhibitors, as a class, had no effect on renal endpoints. Trials were reviewed for data on renal endpoints, including peripheral edema, hypertension, and renal dysfunction (defined as significant worsening of serum urea or creatinine, or clinical evidence of kidney disease and renal failure). When viewed separately, rofecoxib (Vioxx) was associated with a composite relative risk (RR) of 1.53 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.33-1.76) for all renal endpoints compared with controls. In contrast, the composite relative risk for the same endpoints among patients taking celecoxib (Celebrex) was 0.97 (95% CI, 0.84-1.12), indicating no effect on renal function. In fact, for the specific outcomes of hypertension and renal dysfunction, celecoxib was associated with a decreased risk compared with controls. Stratified analysis by type of control (placebo, alternate NSAID, or mixed) yielded consistent results; rofecoxib was uniquely associated with adverse renal outcomes. No effect on renal function was noted for celecoxib compared with the same controls: the relative risk for adverse renal effects was 0.87 (95% CI, 0.55-1.38), 0.93 (95% CI, 0.70-1.23), and 1.26 (95% CI, 0.94-1.69) for celecoxib vs placebo, NSAID, and mixed controls, respectively. Statistical analysis for heterogeneity showed that the variation in effects on renal function among the COX-2 inhibitors was more likely due to actual differences than due to chance (heterogeneity [I2]=57%; P<.001)."
"Should patients with acute deep venous thrombosis limit activity
To investigate the effect of compression and immediate ambulation in the acute stage of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) on the development of postthrombotic syndrome (PTS). Design: follow-up study of patients who previously have been enrolled in a randomized controlled trial. Setting: outpatient department of a municipial hospital. Subjects and interventions: a follow-up was performed 2 years after 53 patients with acute proximal DVT had been enrolled into a randomized controlled trial, comparing bed rest and no compression (n=17), Unna boot bandages plus walking (n=18) and compression stockings plus walking (n=18). Telephone interviews could be conducted with 11 patients, 37 patients could be reinvestigated by independent observers (11 from the bed-rest group, 13 from the bandage group and 13 from the stocking group). Compression stockings up to the time of the follow-up were worn by 8/11 (73%) of the bed-rest patients and by 13/26 (50%) of the mobile patients. Main outcome measures: clinical and venous duplex investigation, pain assessment using visual analogue scale and Lowenberg test, leg circumference, clinical ''PTS-score'' combining 5 subjective symptoms with 6 objective signs (Villalta-Prandoni-scale). Duplex investigation of the deep veins and pain assessment by visual analogue scale showed no significant differences between the groups. Nine out of 11 patients after bed rest, but only 16/26 in the mobile groups showed a larger calf circumference on the diseased leg (n.s.). Judged by the Villalta-Prandoni-scale a significantly better outcome could be found in the mobile group (mean score 5.1) than in the bed-rest group (mean score 8.2), (p<0.01). (''Mild PTS'' = score 5-14, ''severe PTS'' score = or > 15). Eighteen out of 26 mobile patients, but only 2/11 bed-rest patients had a score = or < 5 (''no PTS''). Immediate mobilisation with compression in the acute stage of DVT reduces the incidence and the severity of PTS.","The difference between ambulation with leg compression, compared with bed rest without compression, was detectable 2 years after DVT."
"Do antioxidants vitamins C, E improve outcomes in patients with coronary artery disease
There is conflicting evidence on the benefits of foods rich in vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol), n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), and their pharmacological substitutes. We investigated the effects of these substances as supplements in patients who had myocardial infarction. From October, 1993, to September, 1995, 11,324 patients surviving recent (< or = 3 months) myocardial infarction were randomly assigned supplements of n-3 PUFA (1 g daily, n=2836), vitamin E (300 mg daily, n=2830), both (n=2830), or none (control, n=2828) for 3.5 years. The primary combined efficacy endpoint was death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and stroke. Intention-to-treat analyses were done according to a factorial design (two-way) and by treatment group (four-way). Treatment with n-3 PUFA, but not vitamin E, significantly lowered the risk of the primary endpoint (relative-risk decrease 10% [95% CI 1-18] by two-way analysis, 15% [2-26] by four-way analysis). Benefit was attributable to a decrease in the risk of death (14% [3-24] two-way, 20% [6-33] four-way) and cardiovascular death (17% [3-29] two-way, 30% [13-44] four-way). The effect of the combined treatment was similar to that for n-3 PUFA for the primary endpoint (14% [1-26]) and for fatal events (20% [5-33]). Dietary supplementation with n-3 PUFA led to a clinically important and statistically significant benefit. Vitamin E had no benefit. Its effects on fatal cardiovascular events require further exploration.",One randomized controlled trials with an open-label design with central randomization and 4 treatment arms demonstrated no change in all-cause mortality or incidence of total cardiovascular events.
"What are the indications for treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors in patients with diabetes
Diabetes mellitus is a strong risk factor for cardiovascular and renal disease. We investigated whether the angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitor ramipril can lower these risks in patients with diabetes. 3577 people with diabetes included in the Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation study, aged 55 years or older, who had a previous cardiovascular event or at least one other cardiovascular risk factor, no clinical proteinuria, heart failure, or low ejection fraction, and who were not taking ACE inhibitors, were randomly assigned ramipril (10 mg/day) or placebo, and vitamin E or placebo, according to a two-by-two factorial design. The combined primary outcome was myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular death. Overt nephropathy was a main outcome in a substudy. The study was stopped 6 months early (after 4.5 years) by the independent data safety and monitoring board because of a consistent benefit of ramipril compared with placebo. Ramipril lowered the risk of the combined primary outcome by 25% (95% CI 12-36, p=0.0004), myocardial infarction by 22% (6-36), stroke by 33% (10-50), cardiovascular death by 37% (21-51), total mortality by 24% (8-37), revascularisation by 17% (2-30), and overt nephropathy by 24% (3-40, p=0.027). After adjustment for the changes in systolic (2.4 mm Hg) and diastolic (1.0 mm Hg) blood pressures, ramipril still lowered the risk of the combined primary outcome by 25% (12-36, p=0.0004). Ramipril was beneficial for cardiovascular events and overt nephropathy in people with diabetes. The cardiovascular benefit was greater than that attributable to the decrease in blood pressure. This treatment represents a vasculoprotective and renoprotective effect for people with diabetes.","Cardiovascular disease (CVD) accounts for 60% to 75% of all deaths in patients with diabetes. Those patients with diabetes who do not have clinical evidence of cardiovascular disease have a similar mortality rate from cardiovascular disease as patients who do not have diabetes but do have known CVD. The Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation (HOPE) study and the MICRO-HOPE substudy added a low dose of ramipril to the current regimen in patients with diabetes who are older than 55 years and have additional risk factors, which lowered the risk of death, cardiovascular events, and nephropathy by 24% to 25% each. The cardiovascular effect was greater than that attributed to the decrease in blood pressure. It is not possible to generalize from this study the effects on risk reduction of treatment of nonhypertensive or lower-risk patients with diabetes."
"Is nedocromil effective in preventing asthmatic attacks in patients with asthma
Inhaled nedocromil sodium, an anti-inflammatory agent for the maintenance treatment of asthma, has been the subject of many clinical trials but only a proportion have been published. This paper provides an overview analysis of all known placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized therapeutic trials. Both single centre and multicentre trials are included. A comparison has been made between the treatment effects of nedocromil sodium and placebo, using six efficacy variables (day and night asthma, cough, mean daily peak expiratory flow rate, inhaled bronchodilator use, clinic lung function (forced expiratory volume in one second) and global opinion of treatment efficacy. One hundred and twenty seven trial centres, involving 4,723 patients, have been included. The results demonstrate the efficacy of inhaled nedocromil sodium in a variety of patients with asthma. Optimal effects are evident in patients with moderate asthma, currently receiving treatment with inhaled and oral bronchodilators.","A systematic review encompassing 127 trial centers and 4723 patients concluded that inhaled nedocromil was effective for a variety of patients with asthma. Significant improvements were noted in FEV1, PEFR, use of bronchodilators, symptom scores, and quality of life scores. The reviewers found nedocromil to be most effective for patients with moderate disease already taking bronchodilators orresponding to the ""mild persistent asthma"" category."
"When should you order a Lyme titer
We investigated the appearance and evolution of immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi in 46 patients with culture-proven erythema migrans (EM). All patients received antimicrobial treatment and were prospectively evaluated for up to 1 year. A total of 257 serially collected serum samples were tested by commercial IgG-IgM enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and separate IgM and IgG immunoblots (IBs). At the baseline, 33% of the patients had a positive ELISA result and 43% of the patients had a positive IgM IB result by using the criteria of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-Association of State and Territorial Public Health Laboratory Directors for the interpretation of IB results. Positive serology at the baseline and the rate of seroconversion correlated directly with disease duration and/or evidence of dissemination prior to treatment. At days 8 to 14 after the baseline, 91% of patients had a positive ELISA result and/or IgM IB result. Peak IgM antibody levels were seen at this time in patients with localized or disseminated disease. The most frequent IgM bands at the baseline and the peak were of 24 kDa (OspC), 41 kDa, and 37 kDa. Although 89% of the patients developed IgG antibodies as determined at a follow-up examination, only 22% were positive by the IgG IB criteria of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-Association of State and Territorial Public Health Laboratory Directors. The persistence of antibodies was directly related to disease duration and/or dissemination prior to treatment. Since IgM antibodies to the 24- and 41-kDa antigens remained detectable for long periods, 38% of IgM IBs were still positive at 1 year postbaseline. IgM to antigens of 39, 58, 60, 66, or 93 kDa, conversely, were most often seen in sera obtained within 1 month postbaseline. Their presence may be of assistance in confirming a recent infection with B. burgdorferi in individuals living in areas where Lyme disease is endemic.","In a prospective study of 46 treated patients with culture-proven erythema migrans, 91% had a positive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or immunoglobulin M (IgM) immunoblot result at 8 to 14 days after baseline. Peak IgM antibody levels were seen at this time among patients with localized or disseminated disease. Detectable IgM levels appeared within a few days of onset of erythema migrans and were found in most individuals with disease of at least 2 weeks duration."
"Do testosterone injections increase libido for elderly hypogonadal patients
Many studies have shown cross-sectional (and two small studies, longitudinal) declines in total and/or free testosterone (T) levels, with age, in men. The extent to which decline in T is the result of the aging process per se, as opposed to chronic illness, medication use, and other age-related factors, remains controversial. The frequency with which aging leads to T levels consistent with hypogonadism has also not been defined. These issues bear on the potential use of T replacement in aging men, because aging and hypogonadism have, in common, reduced bone and lean body mass and muscle strength and increased total and abdominal fat. We measured T and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), by RIA, in stored samples from 890 men in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study on Aging. Using a mixed-effects model, we found independent effects of age and date of sampling to reduce T levels. After compensating for date effects, which investigation suggested was artifactual, we observed significant, independent, age-invariant, longitudinal effects of age on both T and free T index (free T index = T/SHBG), with an average change of -0.124 nmol/L.yr and -0.0049 nmol T/nmol SHBG.yr. T, but not free T index, also decreased with increasing body mass index. Use of beta-blocking drugs was associated with higher T and higher free T index levels. Using total T criteria, incidence of hypogonadal T levels increased to about 20% of men over 60, 30% over 70 and 50% over 80 yr of age, and even greater percentages when free T index criteria were employed. Our observations of health factor independent, age-related longitudinal decreases in T and free T, resulting in a high frequency of hypogonadal values, suggest that further investigation of T replacement in aged men, perhaps targeted to those with the lowest serum T concentrations, are justified.","Although the decline is gradual, by the eighth decade 30% of men have total testosterone values in the hypogonadal range and 50% have low free testosterone values."
"What are the best therapies for acute migraine in pregnancy
This study investigates the use of biofeedback, relaxation and psychotherapy on five patients with severe, vascular headaches that occurred during the course of pregnancy. The subjects received between four and twelve sessions of treatment overall. The subjects all showed a marked reduction or complete cessation of headaches during treatment, the term of pregnancy, and during a follow-up evaluation months after the birth of the child. Possible alternate explanations for improvement are discussed along with the study's limitations. This preliminary investigation strongly suggests that psychological treatment may be a particularly useful intervention for management of headaches that occur in pregnant women.","A small case series of electromyograph (EMG) biofeedback and relaxation techniques on 5 pregnant women showed that 4 became headache-free. It is impossible to say whether it was the intervention, natural disease progression, or the attention received from the therapist that produced this result."
"What are the indications for treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors in patients with diabetes
Renal function declines progressively in patients who have diabetic nephropathy, and the decline may be slowed by antihypertensive drugs. The purpose of this study was to determine whether captopril has kidney-protecting properties independent of its effect on blood pressure in diabetic nephropathy. We performed a randomized, controlled trial comparing captopril with placebo in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus in whom urinary protein excretion was > or = 500 mg per day and the serum creatinine concentration was < or = 2.5 mg per deciliter (221 mumol per liter). Blood-pressure goals were defined to achieve control during a median follow-up of three years. The primary end point was a doubling of the base-line serum creatinine concentration. Two hundred seven patients received captopril, and 202 placebo. Serum creatinine concentrations doubled in 25 patients in the captopril group, as compared with 43 patients in the placebo group (P = 0.007). The associated reductions in risk of a doubling of the serum creatinine concentration were 48 percent in the captopril group as a whole, 76 percent in the subgroup with a baseline serum creatinine concentration of 2.0 mg per deciliter (177 mumol per liter), 55 percent in the subgroup with a concentration of 1.5 mg per deciliter (133 mumol per liter), and 17 percent in the subgroup with a concentration of 1.0 mg per deciliter (88.4 mumol per liter). The mean (+/- SD) rate of decline in creatinine clearance was 11 +/- 21 percent per year in the captopril group and 17 +/- 20 percent per year in the placebo group (P = 0.03). Among the patients whose base-line serum creatinine concentration was > or = 1.5 mg per deciliter, creatinine clearance declined at a rate of 23 +/- 25 percent per year in the captopril group and at a rate of 37 +/- 25 percent per year in the placebo group (P = 0.01). Captopril treatment was associated with a 50 percent reduction in the risk of the combined end points of death, dialysis, and transplantation that was independent of the small disparity in blood pressure between the groups. Captopril protects against deterioration in renal function in insulin-dependent diabetic nephropathy and is significantly more effective than blood-pressure control alone.",angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors have been demonstrated to slow the progression of diabetic nephropathy in patients with type 1 diabetes.
"Should we screen for bacterial vaginosis in those at risk for preterm labor
Abnormal vaginal flora and bacterial vaginosis are associated with amplified risks of late miscarriage and spontaneous preterm delivery. We aimed to establish whether antibiotic treatment early in the second trimester might reduce these risks in a general obstetric population. We screened 6120 pregnant women attending hospital for their first antenatal visit--who were at 12-22 weeks' gestation (mean 15.6 weeks)--for bacterial vaginosis or abnormal vaginal flora. We used gram-stained slides of vaginal smears to diagnose abnormal vaginal flora or bacterial vaginosis, in accordance with Nugent's criteria. We randomly allocated 494 women with one of these signs to receive either clindamycin 300 mg or placebo orally twice daily for 5 days. Primary endpoints were spontaneous preterm delivery (birth > or =24 but <37 weeks) and late miscarriage (pregnancy loss > or =13 but <24 weeks). Analysis was intention to treat. Nine women were lost to follow-up or had elective termination. Thus, we analysed 485 women with complete outcome data. Women receiving clindamycin had significantly fewer miscarriages or preterm deliveries (13/244) than did those in the placebo group (38/241; percentage difference 10.4%, 95% CI 5.0-15.8, p=0.0003). Clindamycin also reduced adverse outcomes across the range of abnormal Nugent scores, with maximum effect in women with the highest Nugent score of 10. Treatment of asymptomatic abnormal vaginal flora and bacterial vaginosis with oral clindamycin early in the second trimester significantly reduces the rate of late miscarriage and spontaneous preterm birth in a general obstetric population.","In 2003, a randomized controlled trials evaluating the early treatment of asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis in low- and high-risk patients showed a decrease in preterm labor. The randomized controlled trials included 494 asymptomatic pregnant women who presented for prenatal care between 12 and 22 weeks gestation. If women had bacterial vaginosis detected by Gram stain using Nugent's criteria, they were randomized to receive either 300 mg oral clindamycin twice daily for 5 days or placebo. In the general population, treatment with clindamycin reduced the rate of late miscarriage and spontaneous preterm delivery by 10.4% (95% CI, 5.0-15.8). In women with a previous preterm delivery or a late miscarriage the proportion of preterm delivery or late miscarriage was reduced (16.6% vs 42%)."
"What is the best way to diagnose polycystic ovarian syndrome
Estimates of the prevalence of the polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in the general population have ranged from 2-20%. The vast majority of these reports have studied White populations in Europe, used limited definitions of the disorder, and/or used bias populations, such as those seeking medical care. To estimate the prevalence of this disorder in the United States and address these limitations, we prospectively determined the prevalence of PCOS in a reproductive-aged population of 369 consecutive women (174 White and 195 Black; aged 18-45 yr), examined at the time of their preemployment physical. Body measures were obtained, and body hair was quantified by a modified Ferriman-Gallwey (F-G) method. All exams were initially performed by 2 trained nurses, and any subject with an F-G score above 3 was reexamined by a physician, the same for all patients. Of the 369 women, 277 (75.1%) also agreed to complete a questionnaire and have additional blood drawn. Subjects were studied regardless of current estrogen/progestin hormonal use (28.5%). PCOS was defined as 1) oligoovulation, 2) clinical hyperandrogenism (i.e. hirsutism) and/or hyperandrogenemia, and 3) exclusion of other related disorders, such as hyperprolactinemia, thyroid abnormalities, and non-classic adrenal hyperplasia. Hirsutism was defined by a F-G score of 6 or more, and hyperandrogenemia was defined as a total or free testosterone, androstenedione, and/or dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate level above the 95th percentile of control values [i.e. all eumenorrheic women in the study, who had no hirsutism (F-G < or = 5) or acne and were receiving no hormonal therapy; n = 98]. Considering all 369 women studied, White and Black women had similar mean ages (29.4 +/- 7.1 and 31.1 +/- 7.8 yr, respectively), although White women had a lesser body mass than Black women (24.9 +/- 6.1 vs. 29.2 +/- 8.1 kg/m2, respectively; P < 0.001). Of these 7.6%, 4.6%, and 1.9% demonstrated a F-G score of 6 or more, 8 or 10, respectively, and there was no significant racial difference, with hirsutism prevalences of 8.0%, 2.8%, and 1.6% in Whites, and 7.1%, 6.1%, and 2.1% in Blacks, respectively. Of the 277 women consenting to a history and hormonal evaluation, 4.0% had PCOS as defined, 4.7% (6 of 129) of Whites and 3.4% (5 of 148) of Blacks. In conclusion, in our consecutive population of unselected women the prevalence of hirsutism varied from 2-8% depending on the chosen cut-off F-G score, with no significant difference between White and Black women. Using an F-G score of 6 or more as indicative of hirsutism, 3.4% of Blacks and 4.7% of Whites had PCOS as defined. These data suggest that PCOS may be one of most common reproductive endocrinological disorders of women.",Polycystic ovarian syndrome is a condition of unexplained hyperandrogenic chronic anovulation that affects at least 4% of women of reproductive age.
"What's the best treatment for pyogenic granuloma
Pyogenic granuloma is a common, acquired, benign vascular lesion of skin and mucous membranes which may occasionally present intravascularly or subcutaneously. Pyogenic granuloma occur in all age groups and although they may eventually regress, removal of unsightly, bleeding or uncomfortably positioned lesions is usually sought before this takes place. This is a retrospective study of 408 cases of pyogenic granuloma that were analysed by the Stoke Mandeville Histopathology laboratory between 1994 and 2004. This study was carried out to review the sex, age and anatomic distribution of the lesions and to assess the most successful form of treatment on the basis of recurrence risk and other measures such as aesthetic result, acceptability and appropriateness of the procedure with respect to the patient. There was a slight male preponderance especially among children. The exception to this was lesions on mucous membranes, which were more common in women. Head and neck was the most common anatomical location, in particular the cheek and intraoral locations. Fewest recurrences were noted following excision and direct closure although all techniques investigated showed an acceptably low recurrence rate. Whatever technique is used it must yield material for histopathological analysis to ensure the exclusion of differential diagnoses.","A retrospective cohort study audited recurrence rates in 408 patients (mean age 41 years, range 5 months to 90 years) whose pyogenic granulomas were treated with either surgical excision or combinations of curettage, shave, and cautery. Investigators identified cases of histopathologically confirmed pyogenic granuloma over a 10-year period from a hospital database. Thirty-six percent of granulomas were located on the head and neck, 33% on the arm, 15% on the trunk, and 8% on the leg. Of 326 lesions treated with surgical excision, 4 (3.7%) recurred. The overall recurrence rate was 10.3% for 82 lesions removed by combinations of curettage, shave, and cautery (the lesions were not differentiated by removal method or location). Investigators did not report on residual scarring with any method."
"What is the most effective diagnostic evaluation of streptococcal pharyngitis
Sore throat is a common complaint, and identifying patients with group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis (strep throat) is an important task for clinicians. Previous reviews have not systematically reviewed and synthesized the evidence. To review the precision and accuracy of the clinical examination in diagnosing strep throat. MEDLINE search for articles about diagnosis of strep throat using history-taking and physical examination. Large blinded, prospective studies (having > or =300 patients with sore throat) reporting history and physical examination data and using throat culture as the reference standard were included. Of 917 articles identified by the search, 9 met all inclusion criteria. Pairs of authors independently reviewed each article and used consensus to resolve discrepancies. The most useful findings for evaluating the likelihood of strep throat are presence of tonsillar exudate, pharyngeal exudate, or exposure to strep throat infection in the previous 2 weeks (positive likelihood ratios, 3.4, 2.1, and 1.9, respectively) and the absence of tender anterior cervical nodes, tonsillar enlargement, or exudate (negative likelihood ratios, 0.60, 0.63, and 0.74, respectively). No individual element of history-taking or physical examination is accurate enough by itself to rule in or rule out strep throat. Three validated clinical prediction rules are described for adult and pediatric populations. While no single element of history-taking or physical examination is sufficiently accurate to exclude or diagnose strep throat, a well-validated clinical prediction rule can be useful and can help physicians make more informed use of rapid antigen tests and throat cultures.",A prospective study of 465 suburban outpatients with pharyngitis assessed the accuracy of rapid antigen detection diagnosis using throat culture as a reference. The rapid antigen detection accuracy was 93% for pediatric patients and 97% for adults.
"What is the best way to identify patients with white-coat hypertension
The prevalence of white-coat hypertension (WCH) is considerable in patients referred with elevated office blood pressure. Failure to recognise this phenomenon can lead to the inappropriate use of antihypertensive medications. We undertook this study to determine the profile of patients with WCH. Baseline clinic and daytime ambulatory blood pressures were available from 5716 patients referred over a 22-year period. Individuals were considered to have WCH if they had an elevated clinic blood pressure measurement greater than 140/90 mmHg and normal daytime mean ambulatory blood pressure. Mean age was 53.6 years and 53.2% were female. The overall prevalence of white-coat hypertension was 15.4%. A higher prevalence was seen amongst older adults, females, and non-smokers. Multivariate logistic regression analysis confirmed these characteristics as independent predictors of WCH.",A recent study did not find body-mass index distinguished white-coat hyperten-sion from sustained hypertension.
"Should we screen women for hypothyroidism
The original Whickham Survey documented the prevalence of thyroid disorders in a randomly selected sample of 2779 adults which matched the population of Great Britain in age, sex and social class. The aim of the twenty-year follow-up survey was to determine the incidence and natural history of thyroid disease in this cohort. Subjects were traced at follow-up via the Electoral Register, General Practice registers, Gateshead Family Health Services Authority register and Office of Population Censuses and Surveys. Eight hundred and twenty-five subjects (30% of the sample) had died and, in addition to death certificates, two-thirds had information from either hospital/General Practitioner notes or post-mortem reports to document morbidity prior to death. Of the 1877 known survivors, 96% participated in the follow-up study and 91% were tested for clinical, biochemical and immunological evidence of thyroid dysfunction. Outcomes in terms of morbidity and mortality were determined for over 97% of the original sample. The mean incidence (with 95% confidence intervals) of spontaneous hypothyroidism in women was 3.5/1000 survivors/year (2.8-4.5) rising to 4.1/1000 survivors/year (3.3-5.0) for all causes of hypothyroidism and in men was 0.6/1000 survivors/year (0.3-1.2). The mean incidence of hyperthyroidism in women was 0.8/1000 survivors/year (0.5-1.4) and was negligible in men. Similar incidence rates were calculated for the deceased subjects. An estimate of the probability of the development of hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism at a particular time, i.e. the hazard rate, showed an increase with age in hypothyroidism but no age relation in hyperthyroidism. The frequency of goitre decreased with age with 10% of women and 2% of men having a goitre at follow-up, as compared to 23% and 5% in the same subjects respectively at the first survey. The presence of a goitre at either survey was not associated with any clinical or biochemical evidence of thyroid dysfunction. In women, an association was found between the development of a goitre and thyroid-antibody status at follow-up, but not initially. The risk of having developed hypothyroidism at follow-up was examined with respect to risk factors identified at first survey. The odds ratios (with 95% confidence intervals) of developing hypothyroidism with (a) raised serum TSH alone were 8 (3-20) for women and 44 (19-104) for men; (b) positive anti-thyroid antibodies alone were 8 (5-15) for women and 25 (10-63) for men; (c) both raised serum TSH and positive anti-thyroid antibodies were 38 (22-65) for women and 173 (81-370) for men. A logit model indicated that increasing values of serum TSH above 2mU/l at first survey increased the probability of developing hypothyroidism which was further increased in the presence of anti-thyroid antibodies. Neither a positive family history of any form of thyroid disease nor parity of women at first survey was associated with increased risk of developing hypothyroidism. Fasting cholesterol and triglyceride levels at first survey when corrected for age showed no association with the development of hypothyroidism in women. This historical cohort study has provided incidence data for thyroid disease over a twenty-year period for a representative cross-sectional sample of the population, and has allowed the determination of the importance of prognostic risk factors for thyroid disease identified twenty years earlier.","A cohort study, involving 2779 adults studied aged >20 years, did not find an association between subclinical hypothyroidism and ischemic heart disease."
"What treatment works best for tennis elbow
Lateral elbow pain, or tennis elbow, is a common condition causing pain in the elbow and forearm and lack of strength and function of the elbow and wrist. It is often treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), either orally or by topical application. To assess effectiveness of NSAIDs (oral or topical) in the treatment of adults with lateral elbow pain with respect to symptom (pain) reduction, improvement in function, grip strength and adverse effects. We searched the Musculoskeletal Review Group's trials register database, the Cochrane Clinical Trials Register (Cochrane Library issue 2, 2001), MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE and SCISEARCH up to June 2001. Randomised and pseudo randomised trials in all languages of NSAIDs (oral or topical) compared to placebo or another intervention, or comparing two NSAIDs (oral or topical) to each other, in adults with lateral elbow pain (tennis elbow). Outcomes of interest were pain, function, disability and quality of life, strength, participant satisfaction with treatment and adverse effect. Two reviewers independently applied selection criteria and assessed study quality. Fourteen trials were included in the review. Few trials used intention to treat analysis, and the sample size of most was small. The median follow up was 2 weeks (range 1-12 weeks). There is evidence that topical NSAIDs are significantly more effective than placebo with respect to pain [weighted main difference= -1.88, (95% confidence intervals -2.54 to -1.21)] and participant satisfaction [relative risk 0.39, (95% confidence intervals 0.23 to 0.66)] in the short term, and this finding is robust against the possible bias introduced by the inclusion of unblinded trials and publication bias. The adverse effects reported were minor. Only two included trials assessed the effect of oral NSAID and these were not able to be pooled. There is some evidence for short term benefit with respect to pain and function from oral NSAIDs, but this benefit was not sustained. Significantly more gastrointestinal adverse effects were reported by those taking oral NSAIDs [relative risk = 3.17, (95% confidence intervals 1.35 to 7.41)]. In the short term there may be some advantage in steroid injection over oral NSAID [patient's perception of benefit relative risk = 3.06, (95% confidence intervals 1.55 to 6.06)], but this was not sustained in the longer term. There is some support for the use of topical NSAIDs to relieve lateral elbow pain at least in the short term. There remains insufficient evidence to recommend or discourage the use of oral NSAID, although it appears injection may be more effective than oral NSAID in the short term. A direct comparison between topical and oral NSAID has not been made and so no conclusions can be drawn regarding the best method of administration.","A Cochrane systematic review evaluating the efficacy of topical and oral NSAIDs to treat lateral epicondylitis found that topically applied diclofenac gel was more effective than placebo, as measured by overall patient satisfaction (relative risk [RR]=0.39; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.23-0.66; number needed to treat [NNT]=3). Topical diclofenac or benzydamine gel had a significant effect on the patient's perception of pain compared with placebo, but not beyond 4 weeks of therapy (weighted mean difference [WMD] on a 10-point scale=-1.88 points; 95% CI, -2.54 to -1.21). However, no difference was noted in functional outcomes, measured by grip or wrist extension strength. Patients who used topical NSAIDs reported more adverse events than those using placebo, including minor skin irritation (RR=2.26; 95% CI, 1.04-4.94). Oral diclofenac reduced pain scores at 4 weeks compared with placebo (WMD on 100-point scale=-13.9 points; 95% CI, -23.21 to -4.59). Adequate studies are lacking to show a benefit of oral NSAIDs past 4 weeks. Significantly more complaints of abdominal pain occurred with oral diclofenac than placebo (RR=3.17; 95% CI, 1.35-7.41; number needed to harm [NNH]=5).."
"What nonpharmacological treatments are effective against common nongenital warts
Cryotherapy is a standard treatment for viral warts. Although textbooks recommend treating until there is a halo of ice around the wart (traditional freeze), many authors advocate more aggressive cryotherapy. There are no previously published studies assessing the efficacy of longer freezing times. To compare the efficacy of the traditional freeze and a sustained 10-s freeze in the treatment of common viral warts with liquid nitrogen. Patients attending a dedicated wart clinic were randomized to receive either a traditional freeze or a 10-s sustained freeze with liquid nitrogen delivered by a spray gun. Two hundred patients were recruited, 100 in each group. After five treatments, 49 patients in the 10-s freeze group were clear of warts (64% of non-defaulters) as compared with 31 (39%) of those in the traditional freeze group (chi2 = 6.7; P = 0.009). Seventy-four patients in the 10-s freeze group as compared with 59 in the traditional freeze group had either improved or cleared after five treatments (chi2 = 5.0; P = 0.02). Morbidity was significantly greater in the 10-s freeze group. Sixty-four patients suffered pain or blistering as compared with 44 in the traditional freeze group (chi2 = 10.8; P = 0.0045). Five patients were withdrawn from the 10-s freeze group because of pain as compared with one patient in the traditional freeze group. A 10-s sustained freeze is more effective in the cryotherapy of viral warts but carries a significantly greater morbidity in terms of pain and blistering.",Longer freeze times seem to improve cryotherapy cure rates but also cause increased blistering and pain.
"What regimens eradicate Heliobacter pylori
Short-term therapies for eradicating Helicobacter pylori in selected patients might offer advantages in terms of costs, compliance, and adverse effects in contrast to standard 1-week triple therapy. To determine eradication success and influencing factors in a new short-term quadruple therapy, a total of 243 patients positive for H pylori were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 regimens according to age, smoking status, and diagnosis: a 5-day treatment with 3 antibiotics (amoxicillin, 1 g twice daily [bid]; clarithromycin, 250 mg bid; and metronidazole, 400 mg bid) and lansoprazole (30 mg bid [L5; reference treatment]) or ranitidine hydrochloride (300 mg bid [R5]), or the same 3-day antibiotic-lansoprazole combination (L3) with a 2-day pretreatment with lansoprazole. A total of 234 patients completed the study. On an intention-to-treat basis, overall eradication of H pylori was confirmed in 86.4%: 89.2% in the L5 group vs 81.2% in the L3 group vs 88.8% in the R5 group; differences were not significant. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that younger age (<55 years; P =.03), history of peptic ulcer disease (P =.04), smoking (P =.03), metronidazole resistance (P =.003), low ranitidine trough serum concentrations (P =.005), cytotoxin-associated gene A-negative strains in peptic ulcer disease (P =.04), and outer inflammatory protein A-positive strains (P =.02) were associated with eradication failure. This new quadruple H pylori eradication regimen is efficacious, safe, well tolerated, and cost saving, and may be a treatment option for patients older than 55 years with no history of peptic ulcer disease. Furthermore, strains that are sensitive to all antibiotics, cytotoxin-associated gene A-positive, and outer inflammatory protein A-negative could be suitable for short-term quadruple therapy. Patients with an unfavorable combination of characteristics should be treated for a minimum of 7 days.","A high-quality unblinded randomized clinical trial of 234 patients demonstrated that 2 days of pretreatment with lansoprazole followed by 3 days of lansoprazole with clarithromycin, amoxicillin, and metronidazole yielded eradication rates comparable with 5-day treatment (81% vs. 89%; P<.05)."
"What is the risk of bowel strangulation in an adult with an untreated inguinal hernia
Despite universal acceptance of the value of elective hernia repair, many patients present with incarceration or strangulation, which are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. We reviewed 147 patients who underwent emergency surgery for incarcerated groin hernias during a 10-year period in order to analyze the presentation and outcome in our practice. Median age of the patients was 70 years. There were 77 men and 70 women. Femoral hernias were seen in 77 patients and inguinal hernias in 70. Coexisting diseases were found in 82 cases (55.8%). Bowel resection was required in 19 patients (12.9%). The overall and major morbidity rates were 41.5% and 9.6%, respectively. The mortality rate was 3.4%. Longer duration of symptoms, late hospitalization, concomitant diseases, and high ASA class were found to be significant factors linked with unfavorable outcomes. Because of high morbidity and mortality associated with incarceration, elective repair of groin hernias should be done whenever possible.","A retrospective study of 70 patients with incarcerated inguinal hernias presenting for emergency surgery in Northern Spain reported a cumulative 2.8% probability of strangulation at 3 months, rising to 4.5% after 2 years. This study did not include patients presenting for elective repair of hernias, and therefore it likely overestimated the rate of strangulation among patients in a primary care setting."
"Does group prenatal care improve pregnancy outcomes
To determine whether group prenatal care improves pregnancy outcomes, psychosocial function, and patient satisfaction and to examine potential cost differences. A multisite randomized controlled trial was conducted at two university-affiliated hospital prenatal clinics. Pregnant women aged 14-25 years (n=1,047) were randomly assigned to either standard or group care. Women with medical conditions requiring individualized care were excluded from randomization. Group participants received care in a group setting with women having the same expected delivery month. Timing and content of visits followed obstetric guidelines from week 18 through delivery. Each 2-hour prenatal care session included physical assessment, education and skills building, and support through facilitated group discussion. Structured interviews were conducted at study entry, during the third trimester, and postpartum. Mean age of participants was 20.4 years; 80% were African American. Using intent-to-treat analyses, women assigned to group care were significantly less likely to have preterm births compared with those in standard care: 9.8% compared with 13.8%, with no differences in age, parity, education, or income between study conditions. This is equivalent to a risk reduction of 33% (odds ratio 0.67, 95% confidence interval 0.44-0.99, P=.045), or 40 per 1,000 births. Effects were strengthened for African-American women: 10.0% compared with 15.8% (odds ratio 0.59, 95% confidence interval 0.38-0.92, P=.02). Women in group sessions were less likely to have suboptimal prenatal care (P<.01), had significantly better prenatal knowledge (P<.001), felt more ready for labor and delivery (P<.001), and had greater satisfaction with care (P<.001). Breastfeeding initiation was higher in group care: 66.5% compared with 54.6%, P<.001. There were no differences in birth weight nor in costs associated with prenatal care or delivery. Group prenatal care resulted in equal or improved perinatal outcomes at no added cost. ClinicalTrials.gov, www.clinicaltrials.gov, NCT00271960 I.","One large, unblinded randomized controlled trials investigated the effect of group prenatal care on a cohort of young, mostly minority women of low economic status. Women who received group prenatal care had fewer preterm births than those who received traditional care (number needed to treat [NNT]=25; P=.045)."
"What are the most effective treatments for bacterial vaginosis in nonpregnant women
Bacterial vaginosis is the most prevalent infectious cause of vaginitis. It is associated with significant morbidity, particularly in pregnant women and following gynaecological operations. Cure is difficult. There is some controversy over whether treating sexual partners of affected women can improve cure rates. This paper provides a critical appraisal of the evidence for simultaneously treating the male partner of women affected by bacterial vaginosis. Unfortunately, no evidence was found supporting the treatment of partners of women affected by bacterial vaginosis.",One systematic review of 6 randomized controlled trials found no benefit from treating male partners of women with bacterial vaginosis.
"Which oral antifungal is best for toenail onychomycosis
Toenail onychomycosis is a challenge for clinicians to treat, and this challenge is compounded by conflicting information in the medical literature concerning the efficacy of the two principal agents used in its treatment: terbinafine and itraconazole. The purpose of this meta-analysis is to compare the efficacy of terbinafinewith that of itraconazole in the treatment of toenail onychomycosis caused by dermatophytes. A Medline search was performed for all English language publications from 1966 to June 1999 on the use of terbinafine and itraconazole in the treatment of toenail onychomycosis. Included were randomized studies in which subjects received no less than 3 months (or cycles) and no more than 4 months (or cycles) of either terbinafine or itraconazole. Data were abstracted and statistical analyses (random effects model, fixed effects model, and Peto's method) were applied. Thirteen studies were included from the original literature review of 1636 total referenced reports; four studies did not fulfill our inclusion or exclusion criteria. The primary analysis of six studies directly comparing terbinafine to itraconazole resulted in an odds ratio ranging from 1.8 (95% CI = 1.8, 2.8) to 2.9 (1.9, 4.1). The secondary analysis of three studies comparing either itraconazole or terbinafine to placebo estimated an odds ratio of 1.1-1.7. The former shows that terbinafine is 80%-190% more likely to result in mycologic cure than is itraconazole; the latter demonstrates a 10%-70% greater likelihood. The difference between the relative efficacies of terbinafine and itraconazole was highly statistically significant (p < 0.0001). Meta-analysis of the published worldwide literature finds that terbinafine is significantly more effective than itraconazole at achieving mycologic cure of toenail onychomycosis.","A meta-analysis of 6 studies comparing terbinafine with itraconazole reported odds ratios ranging from 1.8 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1-2.8) to 2.9 (95% CI, 1.9-4.1), indicating an 80% to 190% increased likelihood of clinical cure with terbinafine compared with itraconazole."
"What's the best strategy for bipolar disorder during pregnancy
Bipolar disorders are prevalent in women. Women with bipolar disorder often present with different clinical features than men. Reproductive events and hormonal treatments may impact the course of bipolar disorder. Our main objectives are to i) assess the impact of reproductive events on the course of the disorder, and ii) to discuss the relationships between reproductive events and psychiatric treatments. A literature search was conducted of MEDLINE journals from 1965 to present. Manual literature searches were also conducted. We review the presentation, clinical course, and treatment considerations of bipolar disorder in women, with emphasis on treatment considerations in the context of reproductive events. Treatment-related issues such as teratogenicity, breastfeeding, polycystic ovarian syndrome, weight gain and obesity, and medication interactions with oral contraceptives are reviewed. Women with bipolar disorder may be more vulnerable to mood episodes in the context of reproductive events, particularly postpartum. In women of reproductive age, mood stabilizers must be selected with teratogenic risks in mind, with the highest reported risks in pregnancy with valproate, and the greatest concern during breastfeeding with lithium use. In the areas of the perimenopause and polycycstic ovarian syndrome, more data are needed to advise treatment decisions. We urgently need further study in these areas to deliver care that is appropriate to women with bipolar disorder.","Because concerns about Ebstein's anomaly are less of a problem than once thought, lithium is the first-line treatment for bipolar disorder in pregnancy."
"How can we best treat and monitor venous thromboembolism during pregnancy
Low-molecular-weight (LMW) heparins have been shown to be at least as effective as unfractionated (UF) heparin in the treatment of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in nonpregnant subjects. LMW heparins have been shown to be safe when used during pregnancy as they do not cross the placenta. Up to now, they have been used mainly in thromboprophylaxis during pregnancy and rarely in the treatment of acute DVT in pregnant women. In a prospective observational study, we compared the effectiveness and safety of the LMW heparin, dalteparin, with UF heparin in the initial treatment (first week) of DVT during pregnancy. After confirmation of DVT by ultrasonography, 10 women were treated with UF heparin (25,430 IU/day, mean) and 21 women with dalteparin (16,000 IU/day, mean) for 7 days and, thereafter, all women were given treatment doses of LMW heparin for another 2 weeks. The dose was then gradually decreased and kept at a high prophylactic dose until delivery. One patient in the dalteparin group had recurrence of DVT 2 weeks after starting the treatment. No differences were observed between the groups in symptoms or bleeding complications during pregnancy and delivery. Our results indicate that LMW heparin is as effective and safe as UF heparin for the first week of treatment, but LMW heparin has the advantage of being easily administered and few laboratory controls are required.","In a prospective cohort study of 31 patients, for the initial week of treatment, the unfractionated heparin group received an IV bolus followed by infusion titrated to aPTT levels (goal 70-100s), while lowmolecular-weight heparin group received subcutaneous dalteparin 115 IU/kg twice daily adjusted to target antifactor Xa levels of 1 to 1.5 IU/mL 3 hours after injection. After 7 days, both groups received prophylactic doses of dalteparin throughout the remainder of pregnancy. There were no significant differences in outcome including bleeding or fetal effects. No cases of thrombocytopenia or pulmonary embolus were seen. There was 1 case of progressive thrombosis for a patient on low-molecular-weight heparin."
"What is angular cheilitis and how is it treated
To determine the effects of a medicated chewing gum on the oral health of frail older people. A controlled, double-blind trial using three groups based on random allocation of residential homes. Sixteen residential homes in West Hertfordshire, England. One hundred eleven dentate subjects aged 60 and older who completed the 12-month study. Subjects were assigned to a chlorhexidine acetate/xylitol gum (ACHX) group, a xylitol gum (X) group, or a no-gum (N) group. Subjects in the gum groups chewed two pellets for 15 minutes twice daily for 12 months. Primary outcome measures were salivary flow rate, denture debris score, prevalence of angular cheilitis, and denture stomatitis; secondary outcome measures were salivary levels of caries-associated microorganisms. A single examiner, who was blinded to group allocation, made all measurements at baseline before gum usage and at subsequent examinations after 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Separate analyses were performed for subjects with dentures. Subjects in the three groups were similar in most of their baseline characteristics. The stimulated whole saliva flow rate +/- standard deviation increased significantly for the ACHX (1.4 +/- 0.7 mL/min) and X (1.6 +/- 0.9 mL/min) groups (P <.01) over baseline (ACHX = 0.9 +/- 0.6 mL/min, X = 0.8 +/- 0.6 mL/min) and N group levels (0.6 +/- 0.9 mL/min). The levels of mutans streptococci, lactobacilli, and yeasts significantly increased (P <.05) in the X and N groups. Denture debris status was significantly lower in the ACHX and X groups than at baseline or in the N group (P <.01). The reductions of 91% and 75% in denture stomatitis and angular cheilitis prevalence, respectively, that occurred in the ACHX group were significantly greater (P <.01) than the reductions in the X group (denture stomatitis 62%, angular cheilitis 43%). Prevalence of denture stomatitis and angular cheilitis were not significantly changed in the N group. The use of a medicated chewing gum significantly improved oral health in older occupants of residential homes. Chewing gums should be considered as a potential adjunct to other oral hygiene procedures in older subjects.","A randomized controlled, double-blind study, performed in 21 English nursing facilities, enrolled 164 patients aged 60 years and older with some natural teeth and evaluated the effects of medicated chewing gum on oral health. At the end of 1 year, the 111 patients (67%) completed the study. Fifty-seven percent of the participants wore dentures. Several aspects were measured including the presence of angular cheilitis. There were 3 arms: no gum, xylitol gum, and chlorhexidine acetate/xylitol gum. The gums were used after breakfast and the evening meal and consisted of 2 pellets to be chewed for 15 minutes. Adherence was described as chewing gum at least 12 times per week for 12 months. A blinded investigator examined patients at baseline, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. The results demonstrated a decrease in angular cheilitis in both the xylitol and chlorhexidine acetate/xylitol group at 12 months when compared to the no gum group (P<.01). Cheilitis was found in 14% of the xylitol group (compared with 27% at baseline), 7% of the chlorhexidine acetate/xylitol group (a reduction from 28%), and 32% of the no gum group (no change). The number needed to treat was 7.7 for the xylitol group and 4.8 for the chlorhexidine acetate/xylitol group. This effect size may be exaggerated as the study randomized by nursing home not individual patients, and there was no statistical adjustment for the cluster randomization.."
"Should we screen adults for asymptomatic microhematuria
Screening urine for microhematuria as an indicator of serious disease is controversial because of the low positive predictive value of such screening and the costs and risks of the associated evaluation. To further evaluate test properties, we retrospectively examined the outcomes of 20,571 men aged > or = 35 years and women aged > or = 55 years who voluntarily had a Personal Health Appraisal in 1980 as members of a large prepaid health plan. Hematuria was detected by dipstick in 876 cases (4.3%); 278 were excluded because of evidence of previous urological disease which could cause hematuria. Review of the medical records of 598 patients with asymptomatic microhematuria as shown by a positive dipstick result indicated that 99% had a follow-up evaluation within 3 months of positive test results for hematuria and had various levels of urological evaluation thereafter. However, urological cancers (2 prostate, 1 bladder) developed in only 3 patients within the next 3 years. On the basis of San Francisco-Oakland Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program data, rates of urological cancer were evaluated among patients whose test results were negative for hematuria, and these cancer rates were found to be almost the same as the rate among patients with asymptomatic microhematuria. Sensitivity of a single dipstick urinalysis result using microhematuria to indicate urological cancer within 3 years was 2.9%; specificity was 96.7%; and positive predictive value was 0.5%. Multivariate analysis which adjusted for age, gender, and race showed that the relative risk of 2.1 (95% confidence interval, 0.7-6.6) for urological cancer was not significantly elevated among patients with asymptomatic microhematuria compared with patients who had negative test results. These findings based on a single test are consistent with the current lack of recommendations for screening for microhematuria among asymptomatic adults.","Among 20,751 California health maintenance organization patients who had a periodic health appraisal, screening identified 598 patients with asymptomatic microhematuria (prevalence=2.9%). The medical records for all patients were reviewed for the year prior to screening to find pre-existing urologic disease and then reviewed for new diagnoses over the next 6 years. Three cases of urologic cancer occurred in the group of patients with asymptomatic microhematuria (incidence=0.5%) and 102 cancer cases among the 20,153 patients without asymptomatic microhematuria (incidence=0.5%). Its presence was not significantly associated with either uro-logic cancers or other serious urologic disease."
"What medications are effective for treating symptoms of premenstrual syndrome PMS
Forty women with premenstrual tension received either placebo, 100, 200 or 400 mg danazol daily for 3 months in a pilot study arranged as a double-blind trial. Thirteen patients withdrew by the third month usually because they complained of no improvement. They had significantly higher pretrial symptom scores than those who continued. In patients treated with danazol, symptom scores for breast pain during the second and third months and for irritability, anxiety and lethargy during the third month were significantly (P less than 0.05) lower than scores in those given placebo. Most symptoms improved on placebo in the first month but by the third month only three remained improved. In contrast eight symptoms were improved on 200 mg danazol by the third month. By the end of the trial more than 75% of patients who were still taking danazol were essentially free of breast pain, lethargy, anxiety and increased appetite, but results for other common symptoms were no better than with placebo.","Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists may be effective, but troublesome anti-estrogenic side effects limit their utility. Estrogen and progesterone ""add-back"" therapy to counter side effects further complicates this approach. The gonadotropin inhibitor danazol has a high treatment dropout rate at higher doses 200-400 mg/d continuously, but can be effective in individuals who are able to tolerate it."
"What gastrointestinal stress ulcer prophylaxis should we provide hospitalized patients
To evaluate the incidence and risk factors for clinically important upper gastrointestinal bleeding in critically ill patients requiring mechanical ventilation. In duplicate, blinded adjudicators determined the presence of clinically important gastrointestinal bleeding using a priori criteria, evaluating relevant clinical, laboratory, and diagnostic data. Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were used to examine baseline and time-dependent risk factors for bleeding. Sixteen university-affiliated intensive care units (ICUs) in Canada. A total of 1,077 critically ill ICU patients ventilated for at least 48 hrs. Patients were randomized to stress ulcer prophylaxis with intravenous ranitidine or nasogastric sucralfate; otherwise, management was at the discretion of the ICU team. Demographic data included patient characteristics, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score, and multiple organ dysfunction (MOD) score. Each day in the ICU, physiologic measurements including MOD score, feeding, and other treatment variables were recorded. The significant risk factors for upper gastrointestinal bleeding in the univariable analyses were low platelet count, maximum serum creatinine, maximum MOD score, maximum pulmonary component of the MOD score, maximum hepatic component of the MOD score, maximum renal component of the MOD score, enteral nutrition, and stress ulcer prophylaxis with ranitidine. The only independent predictors of bleeding in the multivariable analysis were maximum serum creatinine (relative risk = 1.16 [95% confidence interval = 1.02-1.32]), enteral nutrition (relative risk = 0.30 [95% confidence interval = 0.13-0.67]), and ranitidine administration (relative risk = 0.39 [95% confidence interval = 0.17-0.83]). In critically ill ventilated patients, renal failure was independently associated with an increased risk of clinically important gastrointestinal bleeding, whereas enteral nutrition and stress ulcer prophylaxis with ranitidine conferred significantly lower bleeding rates.",Recent studies suggest that only ICU patients with certain risk factors benefit from ulcer prophylaxis.
"What's the best strategy for bipolar disorder during pregnancy
There are obvious gaps in research surrounding issues specific to women who suffer from bipolar disorder, including gender differences and their implications for management, the impact of the reproductive cycle, and evidence based treatment guidelines for pregnancy and the postpartum period. Gender differences have not been reported for the prevalence of bipolar disorder; however, women are more likely to experience rapid cycling, mixed mania, and antidepressant-induced manias. This may affect response to treatment, which has been found, in some cases, to differ in men and women. In addition, side effects in response to treatments may well differ in men and women, especially with regard to lithium and valproate prescription. The course of bipolar disorder in women may be influenced by the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, the postpartum period, and menopause, although many issues require further clarification. Treatment of bipolar disorder during pregnancy and the postmenopausal period requires careful consideration, as does treatment during the childbearing years, as some mood stabilizers influence the metabolism of oral contraceptives. This review article has attempted to evaluate existing literature regarding women with bipolar disorder in a comprehensive and critical way, and to consolidate into a single source the gender-specific aspects of the disorder that may have treatment implications for women.","Women with bipolar disorder have a 100-fold higher risk of developing postpartum psychosis. For this reason, treatment beyond delivery is recommended, along with close monitoring of the infant."
"Menstrual disturbances in perimenopausal women: What's best
To evaluate the effects of low-dose hormone therapy (LD-HT) on bleeding pattern and vasomotor symptoms in perimenopausal women. In a prospective, open-label study at an University clinic, 120 perimenopausal women suffering from irregular menstrual cycles and hot flushes were randomized to micronized 17beta-estradiol 1 mg plus dydrogesterone 10 mg sequential added (LD-HT; group A: 60 subjects) or dydrogesterone 10 mg from day 15 to 28 (group B: 60 subjects). Number and severity of hot flushes and bleeding pattern were assessed throughout the study. Women in group A experienced a significant reduction in number of hot flushes while no significant variation was observed in group B. The incidence of cyclic bleeding was 86% in group A and 76% in group B, the mean duration was significantly lower in group A than in group B. LD-HT may control both irregular bleeding and hot flushes in perimenopausal women.","An randomized controlled trials of 120 perimenopausal women with irregular menstrual cycles compared low-dose (1 mg) continuous estradiol and cyclical progestogens (10 mg dydrogesterone) with cyclical progestogens alone. In the combined treatment group, the incidence of cyclical menstrual bleeding was 86%, and 76% of all cycles were rated normal in amount and duration of bleeding. In the cyclical progestogen group, the incidence of cyclical menstrual bleeding during treatment was 76%, and 70% of all cycles were rated normal."
"How effective is prophylactic therapy for gout in people with prior attacks
Various purine-rich foods and high protein intake have long been thought to be risk factors for gout. Similarly, the possibility that the consumption of dairy products has a role in protecting against gout has been raised by metabolic studies. We prospectively investigated the association of these dietary factors with new cases of gout. Over a 12-year period, we prospectively examined the relationship between purported dietary risk factors and new cases of gout among 47,150 men who had no history of gout at base line. We used a supplementary questionnaire to ascertain whether participants met the American College of Rheumatology survey criteria for gout. Diet was assessed every four years by means of a food-frequency questionnaire. During the 12 years of the study, we documented 730 confirmed new cases of gout. The multivariate relative risk of gout among men in the highest quintile of meat intake, as compared with those in the lowest quintile, was 1.41 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.07 to 1.86; P for trend = 0.02), and the corresponding relative risk associated with seafood intake was 1.51 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.17 to 1.95; P for trend = 0.02). In contrast, the incidence of gout decreased with increasing intake of dairy products; the multivariate relative risk among men in the highest quintile, as compared with those in the lowest quintile, was 0.56 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.42 to 0.74; P for trend <0.001). The level of consumption of purine-rich vegetables and the total protein intake were not associated with an increased risk of gout. Higher levels of meat and seafood consumption are associated with an increased risk of gout, whereas a higher level of consumption of dairy products is associated with a decreased risk. Moderate intake of purine-rich vegetables or protein is not associated with an increased risk of gout.","A prospective study of primary gout involving 47,150 men followed over 12 years noted a relative risk (RR) of gout 1.41 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.07-1.86) in the highest quintile of meat eaters, a relative risk of 1.51 (95% CI, 1.17-1.95) in the highest quintile of seafood eaters, and an inverse relationship of dairy intake with gout risk."
"How should you document a patient's refusal to undergo a necessary intervention
The right to refuse psychiatric treatment has become an important clinical and legal issue in the last twenty-five years. This article briefly reviews the clinical, administrative, and legal aspects of the right to refuse psychiatric treatment, especially medication. Emphasis is placed on the clinical issues including the reasons for treatment refusals, and the management of treatment refusal. Empirical data are provided to illustrate the rights driven and treatment driven models of involuntary psychotropic medication administration.",The reasons for the refusal should be documented.
"Does early detection of suspected atherosclerotic renovascular hypertension change outcomes
To report a prospective study evaluating the long-term impact of stent-supported angioplasty on renal function and blood pressure control. In a 6-year period, 456 hemodynamically significant de novo renal artery stenoses > or =70% were treated in 340 consecutive hypertensive patients (223 men; mean age 66+/-10 years, range 44-84) with or without impaired renal function. Baseline data on serum creatinine (sCr), intrarenal resistance index, ambulatory 24-hour blood pressure monitoring, and documentation of the number and dose of antihypertensive drugs were compared to values obtained during follow-up. The primary endpoint was a 10% decrease in sCr; the glomerular filtration rate and changes in blood pressure control were additional outcome measures. During a mean follow-up of 34+/-20 months, sCr decreased significantly from 1.45+/-0.87 to 1.39+/-0.73 mg/dL (p=0.048). In 34% of the patients, sCr decreased >10%, 39% were unchanged, and 27% had an increase >10%. Glomerular filtration rate increased from 59+/-26 to 62+/-26 mL/min/1.73 m(2) (p=0.6). Systolic, diastolic, and mean blood pressure measurements significantly improved immediately after the intervention (132/72/93 versus 144/79/102 mmHg at baseline, p<0.0001) and remained improved during follow-up (p<0.0001). Blood pressure control was improved in 46%, unchanged in 43%, and deteriorated in 11%. Baseline sCr, bilateral intervention, percent diameter stenosis, and 3-vessel coronary disease were independent predictors of improved renal function during follow-up; the number of antihypertensive drugs taken before the intervention predicted improved blood pressure control. Stent-supported angioplasty of renal artery stenoses preserves renal function and improves blood pressure control in a broader spectrum of patients than previously thought.",One cohort study of 150 patients found that stenting bilateral (vs unilateral) RAS predicted a more beneficial blood pressure response (OR=4.6; P=.009).
"What are the most effective ways you can help patients stop smoking
There are at least two theoretical reasons to believe antidepressants might help in smoking cessation. Nicotine withdrawal may produce depressive symptoms or precipitate a major depressive episode and antidepressants may relieve these. Nicotine may have antidepressant effects that maintain smoking, and antidepressants may substitute for this effect. Alternatively, some antidepressants may have a specific effect on neural pathways underlying nicotine addiction, (e.g. blocking nicotine receptors) independent of their antidepressant effects. The aim of this review is to assess the effect of antidepressant medications in aiding long-term smoking cessation. The medications include bupropion; doxepin; fluoxetine; imipramine; moclobemide; nortriptyline; paroxetine; sertraline, tryptophan and venlafaxine. We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group trials register which includes trials indexed in MEDLINE, EMBASE, SciSearch and PsycINFO, and other reviews and meeting abstracts, in September 2006. We considered randomized trials comparing antidepressant medications to placebo or an alternative pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation. We also included trials comparing different doses, using pharmacotherapy to prevent relapse or re-initiate smoking cessation or to help smokers reduce cigarette consumption. We excluded trials with less than six months follow up. We extracted data in duplicate on the type of study population, the nature of the pharmacotherapy, the outcome measures, method of randomization, and completeness of follow up. The main outcome measure was abstinence from smoking after at least six months follow up in patients smoking at baseline, expressed as an odds ratio (OR). We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence available in each trial, and biochemically validated rates if available. Where appropriate, we performed meta-analysis using a fixed-effect model. Seventeen new trials were identified since the last update in 2004 bringing the total number of included trials to 53. There were 40 trials of bupropion and eight trials of nortriptyline. When used as the sole pharmacotherapy, bupropion (31 trials, odds ratio [OR] 1.94, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.72 to 2.19) and nortriptyline (four trials, OR 2.34, 95% CI 1.61 to 3.41) both doubled the odds of cessation. There is insufficient evidence that adding bupropion or nortriptyline to nicotine replacement therapy provides an additional long-term benefit. Three trials of extended therapy with bupropion to prevent relapse after initial cessation did not find evidence of a significant long-term benefit. From the available data bupropion and nortriptyline appear to be equally effective and of similar efficacy to nicotine replacement therapy. Pooling three trials comparing bupropion to varenicline showed a lower odds of quitting with bupropion (OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.78). There is a risk of about 1 in 1000 of seizures associated with bupropion use. Concerns that bupropion may increase suicide risk are currently unproven. Nortriptyline has the potential for serious side-effects, but none have been seen in the few small trials for smoking cessation. There were six trials of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors; four of fluoxetine, one of sertraline and one of paroxetine. None of these detected significant long-term effects, and there was no evidence of a significant benefit when results were pooled. There was one trial of the monoamine oxidase inhibitor moclobemide, and one of the atypical antidepressant venlafaxine. Neither of these detected a significant long-term benefit. The antidepressants bupropion and nortriptyline aid long-term smoking cessation but selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g. fluoxetine) do not. Evidence suggests that the mode of action of bupropion and nortriptyline is independent of their antidepressant effect and that they are of similar efficacy to nicotine replacement. Adverse events with both medications are rarely serious or lead to stopping medication.","A Cochrane review assessing the efficacy of antidepressants for smoking cessation showed that, when used as monotherapy, bupropion (31 trials; OR=1.94; 95% CI, 1.72-2.19) and nortriptyline (4 trials; OR=2.34; 95% CI, 1.61-3.41) both doubled the odds of smoking cessation."
"Do beta-blockers worsen respiratory status for patients with COPD
A substantial proportion of the population with congestive heart failure (CHF) has concomitant airway disease. Little information exists on the tolerability of carvedilol in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In this study, we assessed the tolerability and efficacy of carvedilol in patients with CHF and concomitant COPD or asthma. Between 1996 and 2000, a total of 487 patients began receiving open-label carvedilol. Forty-three (9%) had COPD (n = 31) or asthma (n = 12). Spirometry supported clinical diagnosis in all, and full pulmonary function testing supported diagnosis in 71%. Sixty percent began carvedilol therapy in the hospital and underwent measurement of peak expiratory flow rates (PEFR) before and after dosing. In patients with COPD, mean forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV(1)) was 62% +/- 13% predicted, reversibility was 4% +/- 4% with bronchodilators, and FEV(1)/FVC was 62% +/- 8%. Mean PEFR was 325 +/- 115 liter/min before the dose and increased by 17% 2 hours after the carvedilol dose (p = 0.04). In patients with asthma, mean FEV(1) was 80% +/- 17% predicted, reversibility was 13% +/- 7%, and FEV(1)/FVC was 74% +/- 11%. Mean PEFR was 407 +/- 161 liter/min before the dose with no significant change 2 hours after the dose. Carvedilol was introduced safely in 84% of patients with COPD, with only 1 patient withdrawn from therapy for wheezing. In contrast, only 50% of patients with asthma tolerated carvedilol. Survival at 2.5 years was 72%. In survivors, left ventricular end-diastolic diameter decreased from 76 +/- 11 mm to 72 +/- 14 mm (p = 0.01), left ventricular end-systolic diameter decreased from 65 +/- 13 mm to 60 +/- 15 mm (p = 0.01), and fractional shortening increased from 14% +/- 7% to 17% +/- 7% (p = 0.05) at 12 months. Patients with CHF and COPD tolerated carvedilol well with no significant reversible airflow limitation, but patients with CHF and asthma tolerated carvedilol poorly. The effect of carvedilol on left ventricular dimensions and function in patients with concomitant airway diseases was similar to that seen in our general group of patients. Asthma remains a contraindication to beta-blockade.","A small retrospective analysis of a cohort study that examined the outcomes of 31 patients with heart failure and COPD without reversible airflow obstruction who were started on carvedilol therapy. Over the 2.4 years that the patients were followed, 1 patient stopped taking carvedilol (mean dose 29 ± 19 mg daily) due to wheezing. Whether these 31 patients were also included in the larger study is unclear."
"What's the best way to motivate patients to exercise
The Guide to Community Preventive Service's methods for systematic reviews were used to evaluate the effectiveness of various approaches to increasing physical activity: informational, behavioral and social, and environmental and policy approaches. Changes in physical activity behavior and aerobic capacity were used to assess effectiveness. Two informational interventions (""point-of-decision"" prompts to encourage stair use and community-wide campaigns) were effective, as were three behavioral and social interventions (school-based physical education, social support in community settings, and individually-adapted health behavior change) and one environmental and policy intervention (creation of or enhanced access to places for physical activity combined with informational outreach activities). Additional information about applicability, other effects, and barriers to implementation are provided for these interventions. Evidence is insufficient to assess a number of interventions: classroom-based health education focused on information provision, and family-based social support (because of inconsistent findings); mass media campaigns and college-based health education and physical education (because of an insufficient number of studies); and classroom-based health education focused on reducing television viewing and video game playing (because of insufficient evidence of an increase in physical activity). These recommendations should serve the needs of researchers, planners, and other public health decision makers.","Insufficient evidence exists to support other interventions, such as classroom-based informational health education, mass media campaigns, college-based health and physical education, and classroom-based education focused on reducing television viewing and video-game playing."
"Alcoholic liver disease: Is acetaminophen safe
Severe, often fatal liver damage results from extreme overdosage with acetaminophen. In usual dosage, it is considered harmless. We describe three cases of toxic hepatitis associated with the chronic ingestion of excessive doses of acetaminophen. Each patient took approximately 5 to 8 g of acetaminophen per day during a period of several weeks. The transient elevations of serum hepatocellular enzyme concentrations and the histologic evidence of a toxic hepatitis suggest the liver damage was related to the use of acetaminophen. Alcohol abuse in one patient and negative nitrogen balance in another may have increased the susceptibility to acetaminophen toxicity. With the increasing popularity of acetaminophen for mild pain relief, hepatotoxicity from acute or chronic ingestion may be more common than previously recognized, especially in those patients with predisposing conditions.","Acetaminophen, while widely used, is hepatotoxic in supra-therapeutic doses."
"Which strategies work best to prevent obesity in adults
The Tissue Monitoring System (TMS) is an algorithm that estimates changes in body tissue from a series of daily weight measures. It is intended to provide people with a feedback of changes in their tissue weight so they may have a basis for estimating how much they would have to change their intake or expenditure to maintain their weight at a prescribed level. We tested the effectiveness of the TMS to prevent freshmen from gaining weight during their first semester in college. In two similar but independent studies (Fall 2002, 2003), female freshmen college students were given analog bathroom scales and instructed to weigh themselves each morning immediately after rising from bed, then e-mail their weight to our staff. After 7 days, a linear function was performed on the most recent 7 days of the weight-day function for each participant. In the first study, the slope of this function was e-mailed back to the participants. In the second study, the difference between last point and the original weight was determined, using linear regression techniques, converted to calories, and the information was e-mailed back to the participants. Control participants in both studies were weighed at the beginning and the end of the semester. The untreated controls gained 3.1+/-0.51 kg and 2.0+/-0.65 kg, respectively (P<0.01 for both studies), whereas weight gain of the experimental groups was 0.1+/-0.99 kg and -0.82+/-0.56 kg, values that were not significantly different than zero. The TMS appears to be an effective technique to help female college freshmen resist gaining weight in an environment that is conducive to weight gain. These results suggest that the TMS may be a useful method to help curb the slow increase in the prevalence of overweight and obesity that is characteristic of all industrialized societies.","A study found an association between self-weighing and preventing weight gain. Patients who weighed themselves daily or weekly were less likely to gain weight than patients who weighed themselves monthly, yearly, or never."
"Do statins cause myopathy
Statins (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors) are associated with skeletal muscle complaints, including clinically important myositis and rhabdomyolysis, mild serum creatine kinase (CK) elevations, myalgia with and without elevated CK levels, muscle weakness, muscle cramps, and persistent myalgia and CK elevations after statin withdrawal. We performed a literature review to provide a clinical summary of statin-associated myopathy and discuss possible mediating mechanisms. We also update the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reports on statin-associated rhabdomyolysis. Articles on statin myopathy were identified via a PubMed search through November 2002 and articles on statin clinical trials, case series, and review articles were identified via a PubMed search through January 2003. Adverse event reports of statin-associated rhabdomyolysis were also collected from the FDA MEDWATCH database. The literature review found that reports of muscle problems during statin clinical trials are extremely rare. The FDA MEDWATCH Reporting System lists 3339 cases of statin-associated rhabdomyolysis reported between January 1, 1990, and March 31, 2002. Cerivastatin was the most commonly implicated statin. Few data are available regarding the frequency of less-serious events such as muscle pain and weakness, which may affect 1% to 5% of patients. The risk of rhabdomyolysis and other adverse effects with statin use can be exacerbated by several factors, including compromised hepatic and renal function, hypothyroidism, diabetes, and concomitant medications. Medications such as the fibrate gemfibrozil alter statin metabolism and increase statin plasma concentration. How statins injure skeletal muscle is not clear, although recent evidence suggests that statins reduce the production of small regulatory proteins that are important for myocyte maintenance.",Postmarket voluntary clinician reports include 3339 rhabdomyolysis food and drug administration reports (1990 to March 2002).
"What are effective treatments for panic disorder
The etiology and optimum treatment of panic disorder remain unclear. Imipramine and alprazolam are reasonably well established treatments. Several reports have suggested that serotonin reuptake inhibitors may also be effective for this condition. To investigate this issue, 27 published or presented placebo-controlled, double-blind studies of DSM-III or DSM-III-R panic disorder were subjected to meta-analysis. The serotonin reuptake inhibitors included paroxetine, fluvoxamine, zimelidine, and clomipramine. The standard treatments were imipramine or alprazolam. All three treatments were highly significantly superior to placebo in alleviating panic. The serotonin reuptake inhibitors were also significantly superior to both imipramine and alprazolam. The superiority of the serotonin reuptake inhibitors remained, but was less pronounced, when they were compared to the studies which used higher doses of imipramine or alprazolam. These findings underscore the importance of serotonin reuptake inhibitors in the treatment of panic disorder and indirectly add to the evidence that serotonergic abnormalities may have a role in its etiology.",SSRIs were more effective than imipramine or alprazolam in a meta-analysis.
"What is the best treatment for Osgood-Schlatter disease
Of 118 patients with 151 knees treated for Osgood-Schlatter disease, fourteen patients (fifteen knees) had a distinct and separate ossicle at the proximal aspect of the tibial tubercle. This ossicle appeared after the child was first seen in all but three of the fifteen knees. When the ossicle failed to unite with the tubercle, the non-union was associated with local discomfort during activity and when direct pressure was applied on the tubercle. The symptoms did not respond to conservative treatment for an average of 3.8 years. Resection of the ossicle along with the adjacent bursa was followed by prompt relief of symptoms. Histological studies showed no evidence of avascularity. All ossicles were attached to the distal part of the undersurface of the ligamentum patellae and were separated from the tubercle by a bursa or scar tissue. The findings strongly support the concept that avulsion of the proximal cartilaginous part of the tibial tubercle is the cause of Osgood-Schlatter disease and they also suggest that once a separate ossicle is formed and becomes symptomatic, surgical excision is necessary to relieve the symptoms.","In a case series of 118 patients (151 knees), 88% responded to intermittent limitation of activity (weeks to months) or cylinder casting if limiting activity was ineffective. The remaining 14 patients showed no improvement from these measures; all had surgical excision of an ossicle, sometimes combined with a tubercle-thinning procedure. Only 1 of these patients (7%) did not have complete relief and return to full activities at 6 weeks."
"Are DMARDs effective for rheumatologic diseases besides rheumatoid arthritis
Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a chronic, autoimmune, seronegative inflammatory arthritis characterized by varying degrees of axial and peripheral arthritis. Here, we review the literature on the pharmacological management of PsA and present a simple treatment algorithm based on the available information. Although PsA management must be individualized to the degree and type of joint pain and inflammation, in general, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) still represent first-line treatment of mild PsA. Second-line therapy includes older agents such as gold salts, methotrexate, sulfasalazine, and cyclosporine. The tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) antagonists represent the most recent major advance in the clinical management of PsA.","NSAIDs are still the preferred first-line therapy, concluded a recent publication on the treatment of psoriatic arthritis, which looked at 54 different studies; however, second-line therapy could include methotrexate, sulfasalazine, etanercept (Enbrel), infliximab (Remicade), cyclosporine, or combination therapy. Sulfasalazine appeared to be clinically beneficial for peripheral psoriatic arthritis."
"How can you help prevent a recurrence of diverticulitis
Diverticulitis is a common condition. Practice guidelines from many organizations recommend bowel resection after two attacks. The evidence for such a recommendation is reviewed. A Medline literature search was performed to locate English language articles on surgery for diverticular disease. Further articles were obtained from the references cited in the literature initially reviewed. Most people with diverticulosis are asymptomatic. Diverticular disease occurs in over 25 per cent of the population, increasing with age. After one episode of diverticulitis one-third of patients have recurrent symptoms; after a second episode a further third have a subsequent episode. Perforation is commonest during the first episode of acute diverticulitis. After recovering from an episode of diverticulitis the risk of an individual requiring an urgent Hartmann's procedure is one in 2000 patient-years of follow-up. Surgery for diverticular disease has a high complication rate and 25 per cent of patients have ongoing symptoms after bowel resection. There is no evidence to support the idea that elective surgery should follow two attacks of diverticulitis. Further prospective trials are required.","No randomized trials have compared surgical with medical therapy to prevent recurrent diverticulitis. Extensive retrospective literature fails to support elective surgery after a second episode. Sixty-eight percent to 96% of patients requiring surgery for diverticulitis-associated perforation or abscess had no previous symptoms and could not be helped by prophylactic surgery, and diverticulitis symptoms persisted after bowel resection in 27% to 33% of patients."
"Does ambulatory blood pressure monitoring aid in the management of patients with hypertension
To investigate the association between 24 h, daytime and night-time ambulatory blood pressures and first symptomatic stroke, to compare their predictive powers for stroke with that of casual (screening) blood pressure, and to compare the predictive power for stroke between daytime and night-time blood pressures, in a general population in Ohasama, Japan. A prospective cohort study. We obtained ambulatory blood pressure on 1,464 subjects aged > or = 40 years without history of symptomatic stroke, then followed-up their stroke-free survival. There were 74 first symptomatic stroke during the follow-up period (mean = 6.4 years). The prognostic significance of blood pressure for stroke risk was examined by a Cox proportional hazards regression model adjusted for possible confounding factors. The non-parametric and parametric analysis indicated that 24-h, daytime and night-time ambulatory blood pressures were linearly related with stroke risk. The likelihood ratio analysis demonstrated that these ambulatory blood pressures were significantly better related to stroke risk than did screening blood pressure, and that daytime blood pressure better predicted stroke risk than did night-time blood pressure. The present study which prospectively investigated the relation between ambulatory blood pressure and first symptomatic stroke risk in a general population demonstrated that (i) ambulatory blood pressure values were linearly related to stroke risk; (ii) ambulatory blood pressures had the stronger predictive power for stroke risk than did screening blood pressure; and (iii) daytime blood pressure better related to stroke risk than did night-time blood pressure.",Another cohort study of 1464 patients found ambulatory blood pressure monitoring was linearly related to stroke risk and more predictive of a cerebrovascular event than was screening blood pressure over an average of 6.4 years.
"Can we prevent splenic rupture for patients with infectious mononucleosis
Spontaneous rupture of the spleen is a rare complication of infectious mononucleosis (IM) occurring in 0.1-0.5 percent of patients with proven IM [1]. Although splenectomy has been advocated as the definitive therapy in the past, numerous recent reports have documented favorable outcomes with non-operative management. A review of the literature suggests that non-operative management can be successful if appropriate criteria, such as hemodynamic stability and transfusion requirements are applied in patient selection. We report the case of a 36 year old man with infectious mononucleosis who had a spontaneous splenic rupture and who was successfully managed by splenectomy. Based on review of the literature, an approach to management of a spontaneously ruptured spleen secondary to IM is suggested.","A review of 55 cases found almost all splenic ruptures occurred between the fourth and twenty-first days of illness, and that all affected spleens were enlarged, although only half were palpable on exam. Ninety percent of the ruptures occurred in males, and more than half were nontraumatic. There was no correlation between severity of illness and susceptibility to splenic rupture. No specifics were given on duration of illness or how splenomegaly was diagnosed."
"What is the appropriate use of sunscreen for infants and children
The ability of sunscreen products to delay sun-induced skin erythema is indicated by the sun protection factor (SPF), which is measured using an internationally agreed sunscreen thickness of 2 mg cm(-2). To determine the thickness of sunscreen used under practical conditions. In two double-blind randomized trials performed in five different places in Europe in 1997 and 1998, 148 18--24-year-old students received either an SPF 10 or an SPF 30 sunscreen to be used during their summer holidays. Complete, detailed data on quantities of sunscreen used and skin areas on to which sunscreen was applied were available for 124 students. The median thickness of sunscreen applied was 0.39 mg cm(-2). We found no variation in sunscreen thickness according to sex, skin phototype, study place or SPF. Our results indicate that most consumers do not benefit from the SPF indicated on sunscreen bottles, and do not support the idea that thickness of sunscreen applied would be greater if these products were cheaper. We suggest that information on ability of a sunscreen product to prevent sunburn should be adapted in order to reflect actual usage patterns.","SPF-15 is considered by experts to be adequate to prevent sunburn, assuming use of a 2 mg/cm2 layer of sunscreen (typically, 30 cc for an average adult). However, observations suggest people apply less than half that."
"Do statins reduce the risk of stroke
To determine the relative importance of recognised risk factors for non-haemorrhagic stroke, including serum cholesterol and the effect of cholesterol-lowering therapy, on the occurrence of non-haemorrhagic stroke in patients enrolled in the LIPID (Long-term Intervention with Pravastatin in Ischaemic Disease) study. The LIPID study was a placebo-controlled, double-blind trial of the efficacy on coronary heart disease mortality of pravastatin therapy over 6 years in 9014 patients with previous acute coronary syndromes and baseline total cholesterol of 4-7 mmol/l. Following identification of patients who had suffered non-haemorrhagic stroke, a pre-specified secondary end point, multivariate Cox regression was used to determine risk in the total population. Time-to-event analysis was used to determine the effect of pravastatin therapy on the rate of non-haemorrhagic stroke. There were 388 non-haemorrhagic strokes in 350 patients. Factors conferring risk of future non-haemorrhagic stroke were age, atrial fibrillation, prior stroke, diabetes, hypertension, systolic blood pressure, cigarette smoking, body mass index, male sex and creatinine clearance. Baseline lipids did not predict non-haemorrhagic stroke. Treatment with pravastatin reduced non-haemorrhagic stroke by 23% (P = 0.016) when considered alone, and 21% (P = 0.024) after adjustment for other risk factors. The study confirmed the variety of risk factors for non-haemorrhagic stroke. From the risk predictors, a simple prognostic index was created for non-haemorrhagic stroke to identify a group of patients at high risk. Treatment with pravastatin resulted in significant additional benefit after allowance for risk factors.","The LIPID trial randomized 9014 patients with a history of acute coronary syndromes and total cholesterol of 150 to 270 mg/dL (4 to 7 mmol/L) to either pravastatin or placebo and followed them for 6 years. Among the 350 patients with prior ischemic stroke, there were 388 new ischemic stokes over the course of the study. When adjusted for risk factors (atrial fibrillation, history of cerebrovascular accident, diabetes, hypertension, cigarette smoking, body mass index, and male sex), pravastatin reduced recurrent ischemic stroke by 21% relative to placebo (P=.024). The reduction was not modified by baseline lipid level."
"Should we recommend universal neonatal hearing screening
To compare the language abilities of earlier- and later-identified deaf and hard-of-hearing children. We compared the receptive and expressive language abilities of 72 deaf or hard-of-hearing children whose hearing losses were identified by 6 months of age with 78 children whose hearing losses were identified after the age of 6 months. All of the children received early intervention services within an average of 2 months after identification. The participants' receptive and expressive language abilities were measured using the Minnesota Child Development Inventory. Children whose hearing losses were identified by 6 months of age demonstrated significantly better language scores than children identified after 6 months of age. For children with normal cognitive abilities, this language advantage was found across all test ages, communication modes, degrees of hearing loss, and socioeconomic strata. It also was independent of gender, minority status, and the presence or absence of additional disabilities. Significantly better language development was associated with early identification of hearing loss and early intervention. There was no significant difference between the earlier- and later-identified groups on several variables frequently associated with language ability in deaf and hard-of-hearing children. Thus, the variable on which the two groups differed (age of identification and intervention) must be considered a potential explanation for the language advantage documented in the earlier-identified group.","In a retrospective cohort study of 150 infants examining language outcomes, participants were grouped according to age at identification of hearing loss. All participants received comprehensive in-home language intervention services plus amplification devices. Of the 85 children with normal cognitive ability, the mean receptive and expressive language quotients at 13 to 36 months were higher in the early-identified group vs the late-identified group (receptive language quotients, 79.6 vs 64.6, P<.001; expressive language quotients, 78.3 vs 63.1, P<.001). Total language quotient was also higher in the early group (language quotients, 79 vs 64; P<.001)."
"What are effective therapies for Clostridium difficile- associated diarrhea
Twenty patients with antimicrobiol-associated diarrhea had a symptomatic relapse after oral vancomycin therapy. All patients had stool examinations which implicated C. difficile as the causative agent, and 16 had pseudomembranous colitis. Clinical courses were characterized by resolution of symptoms with recurrence of diarrhea at 4--21 days after vancomycin was discontinued. Studies of stools collected sequentially showed that vancomycin failed to eliminate C. difficile despite susceptibility to this agent with in vitro testing. A review of our records shows the incidence os symptomatic relapse is approximately 14%. This experience emphasizes the importance of adequate follow-up in patients treated with oral vancomycin for antibiotic-associated diarrhea or colitis due to C. difficile.","Treatment of first recurrences of infection with metronidazole or vancomycin produces response rates similar to treatment of initial infections. A minority of patients suffers multiple relapses of infection, and there are few data to guide therapy in this setting."
"When should we stop mammography screening for breast cancer in elderly women
To determine whether breast cancer screening extends life for women aged 65 years or more with and without comorbid medical conditions. A provider-patient encounter. A decision analysis of the utility of screening for breast cancer. Clinical examination and mammography among four groups of women aged 65 to 85 or more years: average health, mild hypertension, congestive heart failure, and average-health black women. The effects of screening were estimated using the best quality data available. Screening saved life at all ages among patients studied. Savings were highest for black women and decreased with increasing age and comorbidity. Screening all average-health women aged 65 or more saved 67,912 years of life. For women who had cancer, screening extended life by 617 days for average-health women between 65 and 69 years of age and 178 days for those aged 85 years or more. Perioperative mortality and test characteristics had little effect on the results. The risks equaled the benefits of screening only when operative mortality was between 27% and 62%. The marginal costs of screening during a routine office visit were $138 and increased with advancing age and decreasing test specificity. Benefits persisted after adjustment for changes in long-term quality of life; however, for women aged 85 years and older (with and without comorbidities), the short-term morbidity of anxiety or discomfort associated with screening may have outweighed the benefits. No inherent reason exists to impose an upper-age limit for breast cancer screening; however, more data are needed on women's preferences for screening strategies.",A incorporated comorbidities in another model and found a small benefit for women older than 69 years that gradually diminished as they approached the age of 85. This benefit was halved in the presence of a major comorbidity. Both of these models assumed that the efficacy of screening in younger women applies to older women.

First, to establish the efficacy of psychological interventions versus routine primary care for the management of postnatal depression (PND). Secondly, to provide a direct comparison of cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) versus counselling and, finally, to compare the relative value of group and individual delivery formats. The study involved 192 depressed women drawn from a large community screening programme in Melbourne, Australia and allocated to cognitive behaviour therapy, counselling, or routine primary care. Baseline and post-intervention measures of depression and anxiety were collected in the form of validated self-report inventories. Women were screened in the community and diagnosis of depression confirmed with a standardized psychiatric interview. Interventions were of 12 weeks duration, including three partner sessions, and adhered to a structured manual. Psychological intervention per se was superior to routine care in terms of reductions in both depression and anxiety following intervention. For those women with PND, psychological intervention is a better option than routine care, leading to clinically significant reduction of symptoms. Counselling may be as effective as group cognitive behaviour therapy. The benefits of psychological intervention may be maximized by being delivered on a one-to-one basis.","An randomized controlled trials (N=121) also found psychological interventions (group cognitive-behavioral treatment and group and individual counseling) to be superior to routine primary care, with individual counseling yielding the greatest improvement in PPD symptoms (P<.05)."
"What is the best way to manage benign paroxysmal positional vertigo
Animal studies indicate that diazepam suppresses resting activity in the vestibular system. Despite lack of clinical studies, diazepam and lorazepam have been used empirically for relief of vertigo. However, drug use with benign paroxysmal vertigo (BPV) is controversial which led to this study to evaluate the value of diazepam and lorazepam for relief of BPV. Twenty-five BPV patients were given diazepam, lorazepam, or a placebo over four weeks using a double-blind technique. Each patient rated his dizziness after each week, and the patient's nystagmus was rated before and after treatment. The result showed a gradual decline in symptoms in all treatment groups with no additional relief with the drugs. The latter was attributed to the fact that BPV represents a dynamic state whereas diazepam provides symptom relief due to action on the system in its static state.","Lorazepam and diazepam had no effect in 1 small randomized controlled trial. In this study, 25 benign paroxysmal positional vertigo patients from specialty clinics were randomized to placebo, diazepam 5 mg, or lorazepam 1 mg 3 times daily for 4 weeks. Patients reported dizziness on a 10-point scale at baseline and after 4 weeks of therapy. Nystagmus severity was also assessed using a 10-point scale at baseline and within 2 days following completion of treatment. The authors found no significant difference between the treatment and placebo arms; however, the study may have been underpowered to detect a clinically significant difference."
"What is the best treatment for plantar fasciitis
Although the application of low-energy extracorporeal shock waves to treat musculoskeletal disorders is controversial, there has been some limited, short-term evidence of its effectiveness for the treatment of chronic plantar fasciitis. From 1993 to 1995, a prospective, two-tailed, randomized, controlled, observer-blinded pilot trial was performed to assess whether three applications of 1000 impulses of low-energy shock waves (Group I) led to a superior clinical outcome when compared with three applications of ten impulses of low-energy shock waves (Group II) in patients with intractable plantar heel pain. The sample size was 112. The main outcome measure was patient satisfaction according to a four-step score (excellent, good, acceptable, and poor) at six months. Secondary outcome measures were patient satisfaction according to the four-step score at five years and the severity of pain on manual pressure, at night, and at rest as well as the ability to walk without pain at six months and five years. At six months, the rate of good and excellent outcomes according to the four-step score was significantly (47%) better (p < 0.0001) in Group I than in Group II. As assessed on a visual analog scale, the score for pain caused by manual pressure at six months had decreased to 19 points, from 77 points before treatment, in Group I, whereas in Group II the ratings before treatment and at six months were 79 and 77 points (p < 0.0001 for the difference between groups). In Group I, twenty-five of forty-nine patients were able to walk completely without pain at six months compared with zero of forty-eight patients in Group II (p < 0.0001). By five years, the difference in the rates of good and excellent outcomes according to the four-step score was only 11% in favor of Group I (p = 0.071) because of a high rate of good and excellent results from subsequent surgery in Group II; the score for pain caused by manual pressure had decreased to 9 points in Group I and to 29 points in Group II (p = 0.0006 for the difference between groups). At five years, five (13%) of thirty-eight patients in Group I had undergone an operation of the heel compared with twenty-three (58%) of forty patients in Group II (p < 0.0001). Three treatments with 1000 impulses of low-energy shock waves appear to be an effective therapy for plantar fasciitis and may help the patient to avoid surgery for recalcitrant heel pain. In contrast, three applications of ten impulses did not improve symptoms substantially.","From 1993-1995 an observer-blinded randomized controlled trial of 112 patients compared standard with sham extracorporeal shock wave therapy. The main outcome measure was patient satisfaction on a 4-step score at 6 months and 5 years. At 6 months, the treatment group had a significantly better 4-step score than the placebo group (P<.0001). In fact, 51% of treatment-group patients were pain-free, while none of the 48 placebo-group patients were painfree. After 5 years, the 4-step score only demonstrated a trend in favor of the treatment group (P<.071) because of a high rate of good results from subsequent surgery in the placebo group. Thirteen percent of the treatment-group patients had undergone a heel operation, compared with 58% of placebo-group patients."
"First- or second-generation antihistamines: which are more effective at controlling pruritus
Urticaria is a cutaneous syndrome characterized by dermal edema (wheal) and erythema (flare) that blanches with pressure. The lesions typically last less than 24 hours and are usually pruritic. In 1983, Christensen and Maibach summarized the theory behind the use of histamine H1 receptor antagonists (antihistamines) in clinical dermatology. These agents remain the mainstay of treatment for urticaria. This article reviews the medical literature on the effectiveness of antihistamines in urticarial syndromes, including acute, chronic idiopathic and the physical urticarias. Older antihistamines, such as chlorpheniramine and hydroxyzine, are effective in the treatment of urticarias, but they also have marked sedative and anticholinergic effects. Newer nonsedating antihistamines (second-generation antihistamines) have been developed that have reduced adverse effects because they do not cross the blood-brain barrier; these agents (acrivastine, cetirizine, loratadine, mizolastine, fexofenadine, ebastine, azelastine and epinastine) cause significantly less sedation and psychomotor impairment than their older counterparts. A review of the literature reveals that there are few studies which document the efficacy of second-generation antihistamines in the treatment of acute urticaria, a biologic entity that usually resolves within 3 weeks. We did not identify controlled studies that suggested superiority of any antihistamine in the treatment of acute urticaria. Loratadine or cetirizine, and possibly mizolastine, appear to be treatments of choice for chronic idiopathic urticaria. For symptomatic dermatographism, the combination of an antihistamine and an H2 antagonist, e.g. chlorpheniramine and cimetidine, appears to be effective. Very few studies have been conducted on the use of antihistamines in the treatment of cold, cholinergic, and pressure urticaria. Antihistamines are the mainstay of urticarial therapy. This evidence-based review suggests that there are efficacy differences between newer, nonsedating antihistamines and older agents in some forms of the disorder. Clearly, further well-controlled clinical trials in larger numbers of patients are needed to clarify the role of these agents in the treatment of urticaria.","A Medline-based review found 7 double-blind, placebo-controlled trials that compared the benefit of first- and second-generation antihistamines in 720 patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria. Hydroxyzine was used in 682 patients, while the remainder took clemastine. Second-generation agents included cetirizine, loratadine, or acrivastine. The researchers qualitatively summarized outcomes and concluded that the treatment benefits were equivalent and superior to placebo. The clinical practice of doubling the dose of second-generation agents for initial treatment failures was not recommended, due to absence of supporting data for this approach."
"What is the best oral antifungal medication for tinea capitis
Tinea capitis has become an increasing public health concern in the last decade. The increased incidence of the disease; its sometimes subtle, nonspecific clinical presentation; and the development of tolerance to griseofulvin therapy have led to the need for alternative safe, efficacious, inexpensive therapies that work rapidly. Itraconazole, fluconazole and terbinafine all possess pharmacologic and pharmacokinetic characteristics that theoretically would make them ideal therapies for tinea capitis. However, few randomized double blind controlled studies using these agents have been published. Thus far none have been conducted in the United States. The best available data support the utility and safety of the new antifungals in the treatment of tinea capitis. However, one must keep in mind that they are not yet approved by the Food and Drug Administration for this indication. Safety and cost considerations favor terbinafine for the treatment of T. tonsurans infections. M. canis infections may respond better to itraconazole, but good controlled studies to confirm this speculation have not been conducted. Short course and pulse dosing are particularly exciting options that may decrease cost and lower the risk of adverse side effects. Further useful information will hopefully come from future randomized double blind studies that will include patients from the United States. Studies using standardized definitions of disease, cure and appropriate follow-up evaluation of clinical and mycologic cure will best identify the optimal therapy for pediatric tinea capitis infections. The new systemic antifungals may provide more therapeutic options for fungal infections of the scalp. Note added in proof A recent trial comparing short course terbinafine and intraconazole therapy demonstrated that 2-week therapy with either drug provided good results and high cure rates (Jahangir M, et al. Br J Dermatol 1998;139:672-4).","Terbinafine is an allyamine antifungal drug that has a very good safety profile. Unfortunately, there is no liquid formulation of terbinafine, but tablets may be hidden in food."
"How effective are exercise and physical therapy for chronic low back pain
To determine the effect of 6 weeks of exercise on aerobic capacity and on measures of pain and disability in patients with chronic low-back pain (LBP). Retrospective chart survey. A fitness facility in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. Patients with chronic LBP with an average duration of pain of 10 months. Six-week exercise program to improve aerobic capacity, muscular endurance, and flexibility. Data were collected from 258 charts of patients with chronic LBP treated from 1991 to 1994, including age, sex, and aerobic capacity. Patients completed the numeric ratings scale-101 (pain scale) and Oswestry LBP disability questionnaire. Pre- and postexercise data were compared for patients with LBP who completed the exercise prescription. Comparative data from the same time period were also collected from the records of individuals not treated for chronic pain (controls) and who had volunteered for a test of general fitness at the same facility. Both the control groups and the patients with LBP groups had statistically significant lower levels of aerobic capacity than a large group of Canadians tested in the early 1980s, the benchmark on which the age- and sex-matched standardized scores are based. The percentile rank of aerobic capacity for the patients with LBP was statistically significant and lower than those measures for the controls. Patients with LBP who completed the exercise therapy showed statistically significant improvement in percentile rank aerobic capacity, as well as statistically significant decreases in pain and disability scores. Aerobic capacity improved to a level above the norm. This study supports the hypothesis that exercise may be helpful in the management of chronic LBP.",A retrospective chart review reported improved pain and decreased disability in patients with chronic low back pain after 6 weeks of exercise.
"Can type 2 diabetes be prevented through diet and exercise
Type 2 diabetes affects approximately 8 percent of adults in the United States. Some risk factors--elevated plasma glucose concentrations in the fasting state and after an oral glucose load, overweight, and a sedentary lifestyle--are potentially reversible. We hypothesized that modifying these factors with a lifestyle-intervention program or the administration of metformin would prevent or delay the development of diabetes. We randomly assigned 3234 nondiabetic persons with elevated fasting and post-load plasma glucose concentrations to placebo, metformin (850 mg twice daily), or a lifestyle-modification program with the goals of at least a 7 percent weight loss and at least 150 minutes of physical activity per week. The mean age of the participants was 51 years, and the mean body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 34.0; 68 percent were women, and 45 percent were members of minority groups. The average follow-up was 2.8 years. The incidence of diabetes was 11.0, 7.8, and 4.8 cases per 100 person-years in the placebo, metformin, and lifestyle groups, respectively. The lifestyle intervention reduced the incidence by 58 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 48 to 66 percent) and metformin by 31 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 17 to 43 percent), as compared with placebo; the lifestyle intervention was significantly more effective than metformin. To prevent one case of diabetes during a period of three years, 6.9 persons would have to participate in the lifestyle-intervention program, and 13.9 would have to receive metformin. Lifestyle changes and treatment with metformin both reduced the incidence of diabetes in persons at high risk. The lifestyle intervention was more effective than metformin.","The Diabetes Prevention Program Research Group1 randomized 3234 patients age >24 years without diabetes but with impaired glucose tolerance and a body mass index >24 to 1 of 3 groups: intensive lifestyle modification, metformin, or control; they then compared the incidence of diabetes over 3 years. Patients were men and women from primary care populations and represented diverse ethnic backgrounds. Investigators defined impaired glucose tolerance as plasma glucose of 140 to 200 mg/dL 2 hours after a 75-g glucose bolus when the fasting glucose was <140 mg/dL. Intensive lifestyle intervention comprised individual training sessions on a low-calorie, low-fat diet, aerobic exercise (such as brisk walking), and behavior modification. Case managers met with each participant for at least 16 sessions during the first 24 weeks and at least monthly thereafter. The control group received lifestyle change recommendations without individualized attention. After 24 weeks, 50% of the lifestyle group met the 7% weight loss goal and 74% were exercising at least 150 minutes per week. At the final visit, 38% maintained their target weight and 58% met their exercise goal. Lifestyle intervention produced greater weight reduction and increased activity compared with the metformin and control groups, with a corresponding decreased incidence of diabetes. Subgroup analysis found that lifestyle intervention produced the greatest reduction in diabetes (71%) for patients aged >60 years."
"What is the most beneficial diet for patients with diverticulosis
To examine the association between dietary fiber, sources of fiber, other nutrients, and the diagnosis of symptomatic diverticular disease, we analyzed data from a prospective cohort of 47,888 US men. During 4 y of follow-up we documented 385 new cases of symptomatic diverticular disease. Total dietary fiber intake was inversely associated with the risk of diverticular disease after adjustment for age, energy-adjusted total fat intake, and physical activity [relative risk (RR) 0.58; 95% CI 0.41, 0.83; P for trend = 0.01 for men in the highest as compared with the lowest quintile of dietary fiber]. This inverse association was primarily due to fruit and vegetable fiber. For men on a high-total-fat, low-fiber diet, the RR was 2.35 (95% CI 1.38, 3.98) compared with those on a low-total-fat, high-fiber diet, and for men on a high-red-meat, low-fiber diet the RR was 3.32 (95% CI 1.46, 7.53) compared with those on a low-red-meat, high-fiber diet. These prospective data support the hypothesis that a diet low in total dietary fiber increases the incidence of symptomatic diverticular disease. They also provide evidence that the combination of high intake of total fat or red meat and a diet low in total dietary fiber particularly augments the risk.","One large, prospective study of 47,888 male health professionals gathered baseline dietary information in 1986. In 1990 and 1992, follow-up questionnaires asked the subjects if they had been diagnosed with diverticular disease in the interim, and whether they had symptoms of diverticulitis. The study showed a strong inverse relationship between fruit and vegetable fiber intake and risk of symptomatic diverticular disease. It also demonstrated a direct relationship between fat intake, particularly red meat, and symptomatic diverticular disease. For men in the highest quintile of total fat intake and lowest quintile of total fiber intake, the relative risk (RR) of diverticular disease was 2.35 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.38-3.98) compared with men in the highest quintile of total fiber intake and lowest quintile of total fat intake. Men in the highest group of red meat intake and lowest quintile of fiber intake had a relative risk of 3.22 (95% CI, 1.46-7.54) compared with men with the lowest red meat intake and highest dietary fiber intake. In this study, cereal fiber did not reduce the risk of symptomatic diverticular disease."
"What is the best treatment for oral thrush in healthy infants
Miconazole gel has previously been shown to be an effective treatment for oropharyngeal candidiasis (thrush) in immunocompetent infants. This study compares miconazole gel with the standard therapeutic agent, nystatin suspension, with regard to efficacy, optimal duration of therapy and safety. Prospective multicenter, randomized, office-based open trial. Twenty-six pediatricians enrolled 227 immunocompetent infants with signs of oropharyngeal thrush. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive 25 mg of miconazole as oral gel four times daily or 100,000 IU of nystatin as suspension four times daily after meals. All subjects were evaluated for safety. Fifteen patients whose thrush was not confirmed by culture were excluded from further analysis. The remaining 212 subjects were entered into an intention-to-treat analysis. Another 29 patients violated the study protocol; the remaining 183 subjects were evaluated for efficacy (per protocol analysis). Clinical cure by Day 5 of treatment was demonstrated in 84.7% of the 98 subjects in the miconazole group and 21.2% of the 85 subjects in the nystatin group (P < 0.0001). By Day 8, the cumulative clinical cure rates were 96.9% (miconazole) and 37.6% (nystatin), respectively (P < 0.0001). By Day 12.99.0% of subjects in the miconazole group and 54.1% of subjects in the nystatin group were clinically cured (P < 0.0001). Premature cessation of treatment at parents' request because of lack of clinical efficacy occurred in none of the infants treated with miconazole and in 6 infants treated with nystatin (P = 0.029). The oral yeast eradication rate on Day 5 was 54.1% with miconazole and 8.2% with nystatin (P < 0.0001). Clinical relapses of oropharyngeal thrush and side effects of the study drugs were observed with similar frequency in both study arms. Miconazole gel was significantly superior to nystatin suspension with regard to efficacy, rapidity of achieving cure and oropharyngeal yeast eradication. Relapses and side effects did not occur more frequently with miconazole than with nystatin. The results of this study indicate that miconazole gel is superior to nystatin suspension as the treatment for oropharyngeal candidiasis in immunocompetent infants.","An unblinded randomized controlled trials assigned 83 immunocompetent infants with culture-positive oral thrush to receive either 25 mg miconazole oral gel (not commercially available in the United States) or nystatin suspension (1 mL of 100,000 IU/mL) qid after meals. The clinical cure rate, defined as absence of plaques by day 12, was significantly higher in the miconazole group (99% for miconazole, 54% for nystatin; P<.0001, number needed to treat [NNT]=2). The eradication rate, confirmed by cultures collected in a blinded manner on the day of clinical cure, was also higher in the miconazole group (55.7% for miconazole, 15.2% for nystatin; P<.0001, NNT=3). In successfully treated patients, infection recurred with similar frequency in both treatment groups within 4 weeks (miconazole, 12.4%; nystatin, 13.0%). Side effects-mostly vomiting and, infrequently, diarrhea-were rare in both groups (miconazole, 4.5%; nystatin 3.5%)."
"Which factors increase the risk of an infant becoming an overweight child
The association between obesity and morbidity resulting from chronic diseases is well known. This systematic review addresses studies of the role of rapid growth in infancy and childhood as possible determinants of overweight and obesity later in the life course. We reviewed MEDLINE for studies reporting on growth in infancy and childhood, as well as measures of weight or adiposity in later childhood, adolescence or adulthood. The methodological quality of the papers was assessed using the criteria suggested by Downs and Black. Sixteen articles that fulfilled review criteria were located. There was wide variability in the indicators used for defining rapid growth as well as overweight or obesity. The age range in which weight or adiposity was measured ranged from 3 to 70 years. In spite of differences in definitions used, 13 articles that reported on early rapid growth found significant associations with later overweight or adiposity. Efforts should be made to standardize the definition of rapid growth, as well as that of overweight and obesity in children and adolescents. The most frequent definition for rapid growth in this review was a Z-score change greater than 0.67 in weight for age between two different ages in childhood. Regarding obesity, the definition proposed by the International Obesity Task Force also appears to be most appropriate. The present results indicate that early growth is indeed associated with the prevalence of obesity later in the life course.","One descriptive meta-analysis reported that 13 of 15 studies found a positive association between weight gain in the first year of life and overweight later in childhood, although overall odds ratio and relative risk were not reported."
"Menstrual disturbances in perimenopausal women: What's best
Although a quarter of US women undergo elective hysterectomy before menopause, controlled trials that evaluate the benefits and harms are lacking. To compare the effect of hysterectomy vs expanded medical treatment on health-related quality of life. A multicenter, randomized controlled trial (August 1997-December 2000) of 63 premenopausal women, aged 30 to 50 years, with abnormal uterine bleeding for a median of 4 years who were dissatisfied with medical treatments, including medroxyprogesterone acetate. The participants, who were patients at gynecology clinics and affiliated practices of 4 US academic medical centers, were followed up for 2 years. Participants were randomly assigned to undergo hysterectomy or expanded medical treatment with estrogen and/or progesterone and/or a prostaglandin synthetase inhibitor. The hysterectomy route and medical regimen were determined by the participating gynecologist. The primary outcome was mental health measured by the Mental Component Summary (MCS) of the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36). Secondary outcomes included physical health measured by the Physical Component Summary (PCS), symptom resolution and satisfaction, body image, and sexual functioning, as well as other aspects of mental health and general health perceptions. At 6 months, women in the hysterectomy group had greater improvement in MCS scores than women in the medicine group (8 vs 2, P =.04). They also had greater improvement in symptom resolution (75 vs 29, P<.001), symptom satisfaction (44 vs 7, P<.001), interference with sex (41 vs 22, P =.003), sexual desire (21 vs 3, P =.01), health distress (33 vs 13, P =.009), sleep problems (13 vs 1, P =.03), overall health (12 vs 2, P =.006), and satisfaction with health (31 vs 14, P =.01). By the end of the study, 17 (53%) of the women in the medicine group had requested and received hysterectomy, and these women reported improvements in quality-of-life outcomes during the 2 years that were similar to those reported by women randomized to the hysterectomy group. Women who continued medical treatment also reported some improvements (P<.001 for within-group change in many outcomes), with the result that most differences between randomized groups at the end of the study were no longer statistically significant in the intention-to-treat analysis. Among women with abnormal uterine bleeding and dissatisfaction with medroxyprogesterone, hysterectomy was superior to expanded medical treatment for improving health-related quality-of-life after 6 months. With longer follow-up, half the women randomized to medicine elected to undergo hysterectomy, with similar and lasting quality-of-life improvements; those who continued medical treatment also reported some improvements.",An randomized controlled trials of 63 premenopausal women (30-50 years of age) with abnormal uterine bleeding compared hysterectomy with medical treatment. Hysterectomy was superior with regard to symptom resolution and health-related quality of life after 6 months.
"What medications are effective for treating symptoms of premenstrual syndrome PMS
Our goal was to evaluate the efficacy and side effects of danazol 200 mg daily given only in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle to treat premenstrual syndrome and premenstrual mastalgia. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 3 menstrual cycles in a postgraduate medical school and National Health Service hospital. The subjects of the study were 100 women who had been referred to the premenstrual syndrome clinic at the North Staffordshire Hospital for the management of premenstrual syndrome and premenstrual breast pain. Outcome measures for the study included assessment of improvement in symptoms measured by specific daily visual analogue scales for 4 principal symptoms of premenstrual syndrome and for premenstrual mastalgia and assessment of side effects and adverse events. Significant improvement in symptoms was seen in visual analog scores for mastalgia in months 1 (P =.03), 2 (P =.004), and 3 (P =.01) of the study during active therapy compared with placebo. No improvement was seen for any other symptom or for the global premenstrual syndrome score. Side effects on danazol and on placebo were equal and minimal. Luteal phase-only danazol is not effective for the treatment of the general symptoms of premenstrual syndrome but appears highly effective for the relief of premenstrual mastalgia. This approach to therapy is associated with few side effects. Studies of cyclic mastalgia using strict diagnostic criteria are required to see whether the freedom from symptomatic side effects is found in longer-term studies and to determine whether such a regimen avoids potentially detrimental effects on the lipid status.",Danazol is expensive and causes significant androgenic side effects. Lower-dose danazol 200 mg/d luteal phase only is better tolerated but ineffective.
"What treatments work best for constipation in children
Faecal impaction with or without encopresis is a very common problem. We performed a randomized, open-label, prospective study to compare the efficacy and acceptability of the treatment of faecal impaction using either mineral oil or pineapple-flavoured isotonic intestinal lavage solution containing polyethylene glycol-3350 (Colyte). Thirty-six patients over 2 years of age were randomized to receive either mineral oil or flavoured lavage solution. The dose of mineral oil was 2 to 8 tablespoons twice a day for two days (17 patients--Group I) and of lavage solution was 20 ml/kg/h for 4 hours on two consecutive days (19 patients--Group II). The patients were assessed for the presence of abdominal faecal masses, presence and consistency of rectal mass, perineal soiling before and two days after either of the randomly assigned treatment. The patients and parents were asked regarding the compliance with treatment, side-effects, number of bowel movements after treatment and willingness to try similar treatment if faecal impaction recurred. Patients in the lavage group had more frequent bowel movements, and showed more effective clearance of abdominal and rectal lumps (P < 0.01) at the time of repeat examination at two days. However, they had some vomiting and were less compliant (P < 0.01) when compared to mineral oil patients. We conclude that balanced lavage solution effectively relieves faecal impaction, however, compliance with its use is poorer than that with mineral oil.","One fair-quality randomized controlled trials of 48 children with fecal impaction compared polyethylene glycol with mineral oil. polyethylene glycol was more effective, but high-volume polyethylene glycol caused more vomiting and less compliance."
"What is the best approach for patients with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance detected on Pap smear
More than 2 million U.S. women receive an equivocal cervical cytologic diagnosis (atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance [ASCUS]) each year. Effective colposcopy triage strategies are needed to identify the minority of women who have clinically significant disease while avoiding excessive follow-up evaluation for others. The ASCUS/LSIL (i.e., low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion) Triage Study (ALTS) is a multicenter, randomized trial comparing the sensitivity and specificity of the following three management strategies to detect cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 (CIN3): 1) immediate colposcopy (considered to be the reference standard), 2) triage to colposcopy based on human papillomavirus (HPV) results from Hybrid Capture 2(TM) (HC 2) and thin-layer cytology results, or 3) triage based on cytology results alone. This article summarizes the cross-sectional enrollment results for 3488 women with a referral diagnosis of ASCUS. All statistical tests are two-sided. Among participants with ASCUS, the underlying prevalence of histologically confirmed CIN3 was 5.1%. Sensitivity to detect CIN3 or above by testing for cancer-associated HPV DNA was 96.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 91.6% to 98.8%), with 56.1% of women referred to colposcopy. Sensitivity of a single repeat cytology specimen with a triage threshold of HSIL or above was 44.1% (95% CI = 35.6% to 52.9%), with 6.9% referred. Sensitivity of a lower cytology triage threshold of ASCUS or above was 85.3% (95% CI = 78.2% to 90.8%), with 58.6% referred. HC 2 testing for cancer-associated HPV DNA is a viable option in the management of women with ASCUS. It has greater sensitivity to detect CIN3 or above and specificity comparable to a single additional cytologic test indicating ASCUS or above.","The recent ASCUS-LSIL Triage Study (ALTS), a multicenter randomized trial, directly addressed the appropriate evaluation of ASCUS. The trial compared 3 management strategies for atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance Pap smears: reflex HPV-DNA testing (the initial Pap sample is tested for HPV only if the results are ASCUS), immediate referral for colposcopy, and repeat Pap smears. Reflex HPV testing had a sensitivity of 96% for detecting high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion and a negative predictive value of 98%. The 44% of women with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance who tested negative for high-risk HPV were able to avoid colposcopy. A single repeat Pap smear within 4 to 6 months, with referral for colposcopy if abnormal, had a sensitivity of 85% (sensitivity might be expected to improve with a second repeat test) and a similar colposcopy referral rate."
"How do you evaluate macrocytosis without anemia
The cause of macrocytosis (mean corpuscular volume (MCV) greater than or equal to 105 fl) was investigated over a period of 16 months in the 70 known cases of +/- 4000 patients seen by the Department of Internal Medicine. By means of simple laboratory investigations the cause of elevated MCV was found in more than 90% of the cases. We found vitamin B12 or folic acid deficiency in 27 patients, alcohol abuse in 18, chronic persistent hepatitis in 2, hematological (pre-) malignancy in 9, hemolysis in 4, hypothyroidism in 2, and a drug effect in one patient. In 6 cases the elevated MCV could not be explained. Macrocytosis, a frequent finding that is not related to the hemoglobin concentration, is an indicator of serious pathology. The MCV level can be used to differentiate between the diagnostic categories. Only 21 patients (30%) had megaloblastic erythropoiesis that was difficult to recognize in the peripheral blood. Among the findings at routine laboratory investigations an elevated MCV may be the only indicator of vitamin deficiency, preleukemia or alcoholism.",A prospective study of primary care patients reported little diagnostic value for the peripheral smear.
"When is it OK for children to start drinking fruit juice
To examine American beverage consumption trends and causes. Nationally representative data from the 1977-1978 Nationwide Food Consumption Survey, the 1989-1991 and 1994-1996 (also for children aged 2 to 9 years in 1998) Continuing Surveys of Food Intake by Individuals (CSFII), and 1999-2001 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey were used in this study. The sample consisted of 73,345 individuals, aged >or=2 years. For each survey year, the percentage of total energy intake from meals and snacks was calculated separately for respondents aged 2 to 18 years, 19 to 39, 40 to 59, and >or=60. The percentage of energy intake by location (at home consumption or preparation, vending, store eaten out, restaurant/fast food, and school), as well as for specific beverages was computed separately for all age groups. The proportion consumed, mean portion size, and number of servings were calculated. For all age groups, sweetened beverage consumption increased and milk consumption decreased. Overall, energy intake from sweetened beverages increased 135% and was reduced by 38% from milk, with a 278 total calorie increase. These trends were associated with increased proportions of Americans consuming larger portions, more servings per day of sweetened beverage, and reductions in these same measures for milk. There is little research that has focused on the beneficial impacts of reduced soft drink and fruit drink intake. This would seem to be one of the simpler ways to reduce obesity in the United States.",Consumption of fruit drinks and other sugar-sweetened beverages by American children has increased 135% since 1977; such drinks account for roughly 9% of daily energy intake.
"What is the best therapy for superficial thrombophlebitis
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the beneficial effects of transdermal nitroglycerine (TNG) in the treatment of superficial phlebitis caused by endovenous catheters and to compare them with the effects from the application of heparinoid substances. The study performed was prospective, randomized during a six-day period. One hundred patients (73 male and 27 female), aged 28-89 years (mean 67.3), participated in the study; all presented phlebitis, diagnosed by the presence of pain, erythema, edema, and fibrous cord in the area around the catheter. Among 50 subjects, two cm of NTG gel were administered to the affected zone once a day, and for the other 50 subjects, heparinoid substances were applied three times a day. The value parameters were: time for the disappearance of pain and time for reducing erythema, edema, and fibrous cord in half (all measured in hours). We found significant differences between the two treatments with TNG yielding greater improvement in terms of disappearance of pain (TNG: 50.2 +/- 39.7, heparinoids: 72.0 +/- 39.9), time for reducing erythema in half (TNG: 28.0 +/- 24.2, heparinoids: 54.6 +/- 34.5), and time for reducing fibrous cord in half (TNG: 58.3 +/- 38.4, heparinoids: 84.5 +/- 41.5). Edema was reduce before with TNG; however, this difference was not significant (TNG: 31.2 +/- 20.3, heparinoids: 33.0 +/- 25.7). We conclude that transcutaneous TNG should be applied systematically in patients with superficial phlebitis, given that it is more effective than the usual treatment with heparinoid substances.",A randomized trial of infusion-related superficial venous thrombophlebitis (n=100) found that 2% nitroglycerin gel eliminated pain in 50 hours vs 72 hours with topical heparin (P<.05).
"Does heat or cold work better for acute muscle strain
The classification, pathology, and management of acute soft tissue injuries are reviewed. Classifications based on etiology and severity are outlined. The pathological processes at a cellular level are described in three phases: acute inflammatory, repair, and remodelling. the management of acute soft tissue trauma is embodied in the acronym RICE for rest, ice, compression, and elevation during the first 48 to 72 h. Additional benefit from anti-prostaglandin medications has not been clearly demonstrated in clinical trials, and if used, these medications should be restricted to the first 3 days. Cryotherapy (crushed ice) for 10 to 20 min, 2 to 4 times/day for the first 2 to 3 days is helpful in promoting early return to full activity. Early mobilization, guided by the pain response, promotes a more rapid return to full activity. Early mobilization, guided by the pain response, promotes a more rapid return to full functional recovery. Progressive resistance exercises (isotonic, isokinetic, and isometric) are essential to restore full muscle and joint function. Rehabilitation is complete when the injured and adjacent tissues are restored to full pain-free functional capacity under competitive conditions in association with the necessary level of cardiovascular respiratory fitness.","Most authorities recommend empiric treatment with cryotherapy during the acute inflammatory phase-the first 24 to 48 hours after injury.Although not rigorously studied, some sources recommend applying cold to the involved muscle for the first 4 hours after injury at intervals of 10 to 20 minutes every 30 to 60 minutes."
"Does warfarin prevent deep venous thrombosis in high-risk patients
In patients with idiopathic deep venous thrombosis, continuing anticoagulant therapy beyond three months is associated with a reduced incidence of recurrent thrombosis during the period of therapy. Whether this benefit persists after anticoagulant therapy is discontinued is controversial. Patients with a first episode of idiopathic proximal deep venous thrombosis who had completed three months of oral anticoagulant therapy (with warfarin, in 97 percent of the cases and acenocoumarol in 3 percent) were randomly assigned to the discontinuation of oral anticoagulants or to their continuation for nine additional months. The primary study outcome was recurrence of symptomatic, objectively confirmed venous thromboembolism during at least two years of follow-up. The primary intention-to-treat analysis showed that of 134 patients assigned to continued oral anticoagulant therapy, 21 had a recurrence of venous thromboembolism (15.7 percent; average follow-up, 37.8 months), as compared with 21 of 133 patients assigned to the discontinuation of oral anticoagulant therapy (15.8 percent; average follow-up, 37.2 months), resulting in a relative risk of 0.99 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.57 to 1.73). During the initial nine months after randomization (after all patients received three months of therapy), 1 patient had a recurrence while receiving oral anticoagulant therapy (0.7 percent), as compared with 11 of the patients assigned to the discontinuation of oral anticoagulant therapy (8.3 percent; P=0.003). The incidence of recurrence after the discontinuation of treatment was 5.1 percent per patient-year in patients in whom oral anticoagulant therapy was discontinued after 3 months (95 percent confidence interval, 3.2 to 7.5 percent; average interval since discontinuation, 37.2 months) and 5.0 percent per patient-year in patients who received an additional 9 months of oral anticoagulant therapy (95 percent confidence interval, 3.1 to 7.8 percent; average interval since discontinuation, 29.4 months). None of the recurrences were fatal. Four patients had non-fatal major bleeding during the extended period of anticoagulant therapy (3.0 percent). In patients with idiopathic deep venous thrombosis, the clinical benefit associated with extending the duration of anticoagulant therapy to one year is not maintained after the therapy is discontinued.","A multicenter randomized trial showed that risk for recurrence was the same after treatment was stopped, regardless of the length of treatment."
"How should you further evaluate an adult with a testicular mass
The objectives of this study were to: (1) establish the causes of scrotal swelling in the hospital catchment population; (2) define the role of high frequency ultrasound examination in the management of scrotal swelling. A retrospective study of 582 patients who had high frequency ultrasound examination was carried out. Those requiring more information on perfusion had colour doppler examination. Forty-four per cent of examinations were performed for scrotal swelling. The cause of the scrotal swelling was mainly extratesticular (75% of all scrotal swellings), hydrocele being the commonest. Of the intratesticular causes, infection (50.8%) and tumour (20.6%) were the commonest. In conclusion ultrasound examination distinguishes extratesticular (almost always benign) from intratesticular (potentially malignant) causes of scrotal swelling. Infection, trauma and torsion mimic the ultrasound appearance of tumour as do rare benign entities.","For patients who have a nonacute scrotal mass, ultrasound is often indicated to distinguish intratesticular from extratesticular masses."
"What's the best way to treat Achilles tendonopathy
Achilles tendinopathy is often treated surgically after failure of nonoperative management, but results are not uniformly excellent. We critically assessed the methods of 26 studies that reported surgical outcomes of patients with this condition. Using 10 previously published criteria, and blinded to study outcomes, we derived a ""methodology score"" (0 to 100) for each study. This score was highly reproducible (r = 0.99, P < 0.01). Scores were generally low concerning the type of study, subject selection process, and outcome measures, which indicates methods deficiency in the way the study was designed, performed, and analyzed. We found a negative correlation between reported success rate and overall methods scores (r = -0.53, P < 0.01), and a positive correlation between year of publication and overall methods score (r = 0.70, P < 0.01). Study methods may influence reported surgical outcome, and we suggest guidelines for improving study design in this area of clinical research. We acknowledge that study methods have improved over the course of the past 20 years.","Surgery is an option for patients with chronic noninsertional Achilles tendonopathy who have failed conservative measures and a 3- to 6-month rehabilitation program. In a systematic review of 26 studies of patients managed surgically, the mean success rate (full return to preinjury activity level) was 77%. However, a negative correlation was observed between the reported success rate and the overall methods score, a rating of the quality of studies (r=0.53; P<0.01). Only 5 of the studies reviewed were prospective cohort studies; the remaining 21 were retrospective cohort studies and case studies."
"Which medications can be split without compromising efficacy and safety
To evaluate the effects of tablet splitting on low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and total cholesterol values in patients taking simvastatin and atorvastatin. A retrospective chart review of total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol values of patients instructed to split simvastatin or atorvastatin between January 1999 and November 2000. Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Huntington, WV. Patients were included if they were taking simvastatin or atorvastatin with regular lipid management and follow-up laboratory results. Patients were required to remain on the same milligram-per-day dose at least 6-8 weeks before and after tablet-splitting initiation and have cholesterol values drawn at least 6 weeks after initiation of both whole-tablet and half-tablet dosing. Patients were excluded if they had a triglyceride level > 400 mg/dL or were noncompliant on the basis of pharmacy records and provider notes. MEASUREMENT OUTCOMES: The primary end points were changes in total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol values before and after the patient was switched to half-tablet therapy. The overall results for this review demonstrated no statistically significant increase in total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol concentrations. Total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol values actually decreased from presplitting to postsplitting, p = 0.017 and p = 0.003, respectively. The investigation showed that half-tablet dosing was as effective as whole-tablet dosing. The program will be continued as a part of quality patient care at the Huntington Veterans Affairs Medical Center.",A retrospective evaluation of 109 patients with split atorvastatin or simvastatin found no significant difference in total cholesterol or low density lipoprotein values after initiating the tablet-splitting program.
"Does combining aspirin and warfarin decrease the risk of stroke for patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation
Adjusted-dose warfarin is highly efficacious for prevention of ischaemic stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). However, this treatment carries a risk of bleeding and the need for frequent medical monitoring. We sought an alternative that would be safer and easier to administer to patients with AF who are at high-risk of thromboembolism. 1044 patients with AF and with at least one thromboembolic risk factor (congestive heart failure or left ventricular fractional shortening < or = 25%, previous thromboembolism, systolic blood pressure of more than 160 mm Hg at study enrollment, or being a woman aged over 75 years) were randomly assigned either a combination of low-intensity, fixed-dose warfarin (international normalised ratio [INR] 1.2-1.5 for initial dose adjustment) and aspirin (325 mg/day) or adjusted-dose warfarin (INR 2.0-3.0). Drugs were given open-labelled. The mean INR during follow-up of patients taking combination therapy (n = 521) was 1.3, compared with 2.4 for those taking adjusted-dose warfarin (n = 523). During follow-up, 54% of INRs in patients taking combination therapy were 1.2-1.5 and 34% were less than 1.2. The trial was stopped after a mean, follow-up of 1.1 years when the rate of ischaemic stroke and systemic embolism (primary events) in patients given combination therapy (7.9% per year) was significantly higher than in those given adjusted-dose warfarin (1.9% per year) at an interim analysis (p < 0.0001), an absolute reduction of 6.0% per year (95% Cl 3.4, 8.6) by adjusted-dose warfarin. The annual rates of disabling stroke (5.6% vs 1.7%, p = 0.0007) and of primary event or vascular death (11.8% vs 6.4%, p = 0.002), were also higher with combination therapy. The rates of major bleeding were similar in both treatment groups. Low-intensity, fixed-dose warfarin plus aspirin in this regimen is insufficient for stroke prevention in patients with non-valvular AF at high-risk for thromboembolism; adjusted-dose warfarin (target INR 2.0-3.0) importantly reduces stroke for high-risk patients.","The stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation III investigators further compared adjusted-dose warfarin with low-intensity, fixed-dose warfarin plus aspirin in high-risk patients with NVAF. An interim analysis at 1.1 years revealed superiority in the reduction of ischemic strokes and systemic embolisms with adjusted-dose warfarin 7.9% vs 1.9% per year, respectively; NNT=16, which led to the trial's termination. Rates of major hemorrhage did not differ between treatment groups 2.4% per year with combination vs 2.1% per year with warfarin."
"What is the best treatment for pertussis
Whooping cough is a highly contagious disease. Infants are the population at highest risk of severe disease and death. Erythromycin for 14 days is recommended for treatment and contact prophylaxis but this regime is considered inconvenient and prolonged. The value of contact prophylaxis is uncertain. To study the benefits and risks of antibiotic treatment of and contact prophylaxis against whooping cough. The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2004); MEDLINE (January 1966 to February 2004); EMBASE (January 1974 to August 2003); conference abstracts and reference lists of articles were searched. Study investigators and pharmaceutical companies were approached for additional information (published or unpublished studies). There were no constraints based on language or publication status. All randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials of antibiotics for treatment of and contact prophylaxis against whooping cough were included in the systematic review. At least three reviewers independently extracted data and assessed the quality of each trial. Twelve trials with 1,720 participants met the inclusion criteria. Ten trials investigated treatment regimens and two investigated prophylaxis regimens. The quality of the trials was variable. Results showed that short-term antibiotics (azithromycin for three days, clarithromycin for seven days, or erythromycin estolate for seven days) were equally effective with long-term antibiotic treatment (erythromycin estolate or erythromycin for 14 days) in the microbiological eradication of Bordetella pertussis (B. pertussis) from the nasopharynx. The relative risk (RR) was 1.02 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.98 to 1.05). Side effects were fewer with short-term treatment (RR 0.66; 95% CI 0.52 to 0.83). There were no differences in clinical improvement or microbiological relapse between short and long-term treatment regimens. Contact prophylaxis (of contacts older than six months of age) with antibiotics did not significantly improve clinical symptoms or the number of cases that developed culture positive B. pertussis. Antibiotics are effective in eliminating B. pertussis from patients with the disease, rendering them non-infectious, but do not alter the subsequent clinical course of the illness. Effective regimens include: three days of azithromycin, seven days of clarithromycin, seven or 14 days of erythromycin estolate, and 14 days of erythromycin ethylsuccinate. Considering microbiological clearance and side effects, three days of azithromycin or seven days of clarithromycin are the best regimens. Seven days of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole also appeared to be effective for the eradication of B. pertussis from the nasopharynx and may serve as an alternative antibiotic treatment for patients who cannot tolerate a macrolide. There is insufficient evidence to determine the benefit of prophylactic treatment of pertussis contacts.","A randomized, placebo-controlled trial studied 300 household contacts of children with culture-positive pertussis. There was no statistically significant difference in either the frequency of pertussis disease or rate of positive cultures in household contacts between the erythromycin group (2.1%) and the placebo group (5.1%) (ARR=2.95%; 95% CI, -1.21 to 7.11)."
"Should you use antibiotics to treat acute otitis media in children
To identify which children with acute otitis media are at risk of poor outcome and to assess benefit from antibiotics in these children. Secondary analysis of randomised controlled trial cohort. Primary care. 315 children aged 6 months to 10 years. Immediate or delayed (taken after 72 hours if necessary) antibiotics. Predictors of short term outcome: an episode of distress or night disturbance three days after child saw doctor. Distress by day three was more likely in children with high temperature (adjusted odds ratio 4.5, 95% confidence interval 2.3 to 9.0), vomiting (2.6,1.3 to 5.0), and cough (2.0, 1.1 to 3.8) on day one. Night disturbance by day three was more likely with high temperature 2.4 (1.2 to 4.8), vomiting (2.1,1.1 to 4.0), cough (2.3,1.3 to 4.2), and ear discharge (2.1, 1.2 to 3.9). Among the children with high temperature or vomiting, distress by day three was less likely with immediate antibiotics (32% for immediate v 53% for delayed, chi2=4.0; P=0.045, number needed to treat 5) as was night disturbance (26% v 59%, chi2=9.3; P=0.002; number needed to treat 3). In children without higher temperature or vomiting, immediate antibiotics made little difference to distress by day three (15% v 19%, chi2=0.74; P=0.39) or night disturbance (20% v 27%, chi2=1.6; P=0.20). Addition of cough did not significantly improve prediction of benefit. In children with otitis media but without fever and vomiting antibiotic treatment has little benefit and a poor outcome is unlikely.","In a secondary analysis of cohorts from a single randomized controlled trials (315 patients), children with high temperature or vomiting who were treated immediately with antibiotics were less likely to be in distress by day 3 of illness (32% immediate vs 53% delayed; P=.045; NNT=5) or have night disturbance (26% immediate vs 59% delayed; P=.002; NNT=3). The greatest benefit occurred among children younger than 2 years and children with bilateral infection (NNT=4). The outcomes were reported by parents, who were not blinded."
"How effective is prophylactic therapy for gout in people with prior attacks
Insulin resistance (IR) has been increasingly implicated in the pathogenesis of gout. The lipoprotein abnormalities described in hyperuricaemic subjects are similar to those associated with IR, and insulin influences renal urate excretion. In this study it was investigated whether dietary measures, reported to be beneficial in IR, have serum uric acid (SU) and lipid lowering effects in gout. Thirteen non-diabetic men (median age 50, range 38-62) were enrolled. Each patient had had at least two gouty attacks during the four months before enrollment. Dietary recommendations consisted of calorie restriction to 6690 kJ (1600 kcal) a day with 40% derived from carbohydrate, 30% from protein, and 30% from fat; replacement of refined carbohydrates with complex ones and saturated fats with mono- and polyunsaturated ones. At onset and after 16 weeks, fasting blood samples were taken for determination of SU, serum cholesterol (C), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglycerides (TGs). Results were expressed as median (SD). At onset, the body mass index (BMI) was 30.5 (8.1) kg/m(2). Dietary measures resulted in weight loss of 7.7 (5.4) kg (p=0.002) and a decrease in the frequency of monthly attacks from 2.1 (0.8) to 0.6 (0.7) (p=0.002). The SU decreased from 0.57 (0.10) to 0.47 (0.09) mmol/l (p=0.001) and normalised in 7 (58%) of the 12 patients with an initially raised level. Serum cholesterol decreased from 6.0 (1.7) to 4.7 (0. 9) mmol/l (p=0.002), LDL-C from 3.5 (1.2) to 2.7 (0.8) mmol/l (p=0. 004), TGs from 4.7 (4.2) to 1.9 (1.0) mmol/l (p=0.001), and C:HDL-C ratios from 6.7 (1.7) to 5.2 (1.0) (p=0.002). HDL-C levels increased insignificantly. High baseline SU, frequency of attacks, total cholesterol, LDL-C and TG levels, and total C:HDL-C ratios correlated with higher decreases in the respective variables upon dietary intervention (p<0.05). The results suggest that weight reduction associated with a change in proportional macronutrient intake, as recently recommended in IR, is beneficial, reducing the SU levels and dyslipidaemia in gout. Current dietary recommendations for gout may need re-evaluation.","An average weight loss of 7.7 kg had a beneficial effect on serum uric acid levels and gout attack rates in 13 nondiabetic men, who were placed on a carefully controlled 1600-calorie diet with 40% of calories from complex carbohydrates."
"Which complementary therapies can help patients with PMS
To determine the efficacy of calcium supplementation in women with premenstrual syndrome (PMS). Randomized, double-blind crossover trial. Outpatient medical clinic of a large city hospital. Seventy-eight women were initially screened. Trial selection was based on a history of recurrent PMS symptoms and on the results of a prospective assessment of daily symptom scores. Only women with symptom scores during the late luteal phase that were at least 50% greater than those during the intermenstrual phase were selected. Thirty-three women completed the trial. A preliminary evaluation included physical examination, routine laboratory tests, dietary assessment, and psychiatric evaluation. Each participant received six months of treatment involving three months of daily calcium supplementation (1,000 mg of calcium carbonate) and three months of placebo. Efficacy was assessed prospectively by changes in daily symptom scores over a six-month period and retrospectively by an overall global assessment. Multivariate repeated measures analysis of variance on symptom ratings derived from daily PMS symptom scores demonstrated a reduction in symptoms on calcium treatment during both the luteal (p = 0.011) and the menstrual phases (p = 0.032) of the reproductive cycle. Calcium supplementation had no effect during the intermenstrual phase. Retrospective assessment of overall symptoms confirmed this reduction: 73% of the women reported fewer symptoms during the treatment phase on calcium, 15% preferred placebo, and 12% had no clear preference. Three premenstrual factors (negative affect [p = 0.045]; water retention [p = 0.003]; pain [p = 0.036]) and one menstrual factor (pain [p = 0.02]) were significantly alleviated by calcium. Calcium supplementation is a simple and effective treatment for premenstrual syndrome, but further studies will be needed to determine its precise role in PMS.","A randomized controlled trials (33 patients) comparing 1000 and 1200 mg of calcium with placebo found a significant decrease in PMS symptoms after 3 treatment cycles. Calcium improved negative affect, water retention, food cravings, and pain. In the study, 73% of patients preferred taking calcium, compared with 15% who preferred placebo."
"Do inhaled beta-agonists control cough in URIs or acute bronchitis
The symptomatic effect of inhaled fenoterol, a beta 2-agonist, 0.2 mg 4 times daily for 7 days, was evaluated in 80 patients with acute bronchitis examined at the Chest Clinic, Department of Medicine, University Hospital of Tromsø. Seventy-three patients completed the trial. End-point FEV1 (% predicted) showed a mean increase of 5.1% in the fenoterol group and 0.5% in the placebo group (p = 0.006). The corresponding decrease in total symptom score after one week was 67% and 51%, respectively (p = 0.06). In a subgroup of 35 patients with either bronchial hyper-responsiveness, wheezes on auscultation or FEV1 less than 80% of predicted at entry, a statistically significant difference in reduction of total symptom score in favour of fenoterol was demonstrated on the second day of the trial. No difference was found in the 38 patients with normal lung findings. Fenoterol was useful when objective signs of bronchial involvement was present and may be applicable to the treatment of acute bronchitis.","A trial was a randomized controlled trial of 80 adults with cough due to acute respiratory infection; it compared fenoterol aerosol 4 times daily with placebo. Inhaled fenoterol is not available in the US but is similar to albuterol. This study showed no difference in cough at 7 days (relative risk [RR]=0.83; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.52-1.30). In a subgroup analysis, however, smokers and those wheezing on initial exam had lower overall symptom scores when treated with fenoterol."
"What's the best strategy for bipolar disorder during pregnancy
Bipolar disorders are reported to have a high incidence during childbearing years and the need may arise to start or continue a pharmacological treatment during pregnancy and the postpartum period. In the last few years several investigations have evaluated the efficacy of emerging mood-stabilizing agents in the treatment of bipolar disorders, such as lamotrigine, olanzapine, risperidone, quetiapine, aripiprazole and ziprasidone. A number of studies, which examined the use of oxcarbazepine, point to its potential usefulness in prophylactic treatment. The aim of this review is to compare information from the literature on the safety of lamotrigine, oxcarbazepine, risperidone, olanzapine, and quetiapine to the safety data on classic mood stabilizers during pregnancy and the postpartum period. A computerized search carried out from 1980 to April 5, 2006 led to the summarization of the results. (References were updated after acceptance and prior to publication.) Emerging mood stabilizers show uncertain safety parameters in pregnancy and lactation. Limited information on lamotrigine and oxcarbazepine does not suggest a clear increase in teratogenicity, while olanzapine appears to be associated with a higher risk of metabolic complications in pregnant women. Data about risperidone and quetiapine are still inconclusive. Finally, the literature on the safety of these compounds in breastfeeding is anecdotal. Untreated pregnant bipolar women are at an increased risk of poor obstetrical outcomes and relapse of affective symptoms. On the other hand, classic antiepileptic drugs are well-known human teratogens, whereas data on lithium are partially ambiguous. The safety of emerging mood stabilizers in pregnancy and breastfeeding has not been examined extensively. Therefore, when approaching bipolar disorder, if possible, each episode must be considered separately.","Antiseizure medications, including carbamazepine and valproic acid, are considered human teratogens in the first trimester. If a woman has an unplanned pregnancy and presents late in the first trimester or in the second trimester, discontinuation of these medication in stable patients is not recommended. Valproate and carbamazepine are both compatible with breastfeeding."
"How should you manage an overweight breastfed infant
Filmed records of an entire feeding session of a population of breast-and bottle-fed human infants were made at approximately 1-month intervals. The occurence of maternal and infant behavior is related to the infant's birth weight during the first week of life only in bottle-fed infants; the greater the mother's response, the less the small infant consumes. There are clear behavioral differences between bottle- and breast-feeding which stem from inherent characteristics of the technique of feeding. Breast-feeding allows the infant to have more control during the feed, whereas in the bottle-feeding, the mother has more control. This concept of control is discussed in terms of its implications for somatic growth and the development of obesity in relation to the advice and training of health professionals.",Referral to a lactation consultant is recommended to manage large volumes of milk that exceed infant need.
"Which factors increase the risk of an infant becoming an overweight child
To identify risk factors in early life (up to 3 years of age) for obesity in children in the United Kingdom. Prospective cohort study. Avon longitudinal study of parents and children, United Kingdom. 8234 children in cohort aged 7 years and a subsample of 909 children (children in focus) with data on additional early growth related risk factors for obesity. Obesity at age 7 years, defined as a body mass index (3) 95th centile relative to reference data for the UK population in 1990. Eight of 25 putative risk factors were associated with a risk of obesity in the final models: parental obesity (both parents: adjusted odds ratio, 10.44, 95% confidence interval 5.11 to 21.32), very early (by 43 months) body mass index or adiposity rebound (15.00, 5.32 to 42.30), more than eight hours spent watching television per week at age 3 years (1.55, 1.13 to 2.12), catch-up growth (2.60, 1.09 to 6.16), standard deviation score for weight at age 8 months (3.13, 1.43 to 6.85) and 18 months (2.65, 1.25 to 5.59); weight gain in first year (1.06, 1.02 to 1.10 per 100 g increase); birth weight, per 100 g (1.05, 1.03 to 1.07); and short (< 10.5 hours) sleep duration at age 3 years (1.45, 1.10 to 1.89). Eight factors in early life are associated with an increased risk of obesity in childhood.","Infants of obese parents were more likely to be overweight at 7 years, compared with children whose mothers were normal weight (OR=10.44; 95% CI, 5.11-21.23)."
"What is the best management for patients who have a TIA while on aspirin therapy
Clopidogrel was superior to aspirin in patients with previous manifestations of atherothrombotic disease in the CAPRIE study and its benefit was amplified in some high-risk subgroups of patients. We aimed to assess whether addition of aspirin to clopidogrel could have a greater benefit than clopidogrel alone in prevention of vascular events with potentially higher bleeding risk. We did a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to compare aspirin (75 mg/day) with placebo in 7599 high-risk patients with recent ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack and at least one additional vascular risk factor who were already receiving clopidogrel 75 mg/day. Duration of treatment and follow-up was 18 months. The primary endpoint was a composite of ischaemic stroke, myocardial infarction, vascular death, or rehospitalisation for acute ischaemia (including rehospitalisation for transient ischaemic attack, angina pectoris, or worsening of peripheral arterial disease). Analysis was by intention to treat, using logrank test and a Cox's proportional-hazards model. 596 (15.7%) patients reached the primary endpoint in the group receiving aspirin and clopidogrel compared with 636 (16.7%) in the clopidogrel alone group (relative risk reduction 6.4%, [95% CI -4.6 to 16.3]; absolute risk reduction 1% [-0.6 to 2.7]). Life-threatening bleedings were higher in the group receiving aspirin and clopidogrel versus clopidogrel alone (96 [2.6%] vs 49 [1.3%]; absolute risk increase 1.3% [95% CI 0.6 to 1.9]). Major bleedings were also increased in the group receiving aspirin and clopidogrel but no difference was recorded in mortality. Adding aspirin to clopidogrel in high-risk patients with recent ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack is associated with a non-significant difference in reducing major vascular events. However, the risk of life-threatening or major bleeding is increased by the addition of aspirin.",A large-scale randomized controlled trials concluded that the combination of clopidogrel and aspirin did not provide additional benefit in reducing a combined endpoint of cardioembolic events in comparison with aspirin alone for patients with prior stroke or TIA. The combination resulted in a significantly greater number of life-threatening and major bleeding complications.
"How effective is desmopressin for primary nocturnal enuresis
The Swedish Enuresis Trial (SWEET) was conducted to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of intranasal desmopressin treatment in children with primary, monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis (PMNE). The study had an open, multicentre design and comprised a 4-wk observation period, a 6-wk dose titration period (with 20-40 microg desmopressin) and a 1-y, long-term treatment period. A treatment-free week was introduced every 3 mo to identify dry patients. In total, 399 children aged 6-12 y with PMNE were recruited. Of these, 245 patients (61%) experienced > or = 50% reduction in the number of wet nights during the last 4 wk of dose titration compared with the observation period. These responders entered the long-term phase of the trial. The mean number of wet nights per week decreased from a median of 5.3 (range 1.3-7.0) during the observation period to a median of 0.8 (range 0.0-5.0) during the last 3-mo period. Seventy-seven children became dry, 63 (83%) within 6 mo of treatment initiation. The percentage of children who became dry was similar in all age groups. Significantly fewer children in the lowest age group were defined as responders (52%; 95% CI 45, 59) among the 6-7-y-olds compared to 65% (56, 74) and 81% (72, 90) in the two older age groups. Desmopressin was well tolerated. No serious drug-related adverse events were recorded and no clinical symptoms of hyponatraemia were reported. The SWEET trial has demonstrated that desmopressin is both safe and effective for the long-term treatment of PMNE, with a significant therapeutic effect also in children of 6-7 y of age.",The Swedish Enuresis Trial SWEET demonstrated a similar outcome in an open-label study of 399 children.
"Does acyclovir help herpes simplex virus cold sores if treatment is delayed
Acyclovir cream has been available for the treatment of herpes labialis in numerous countries outside the United States for over a decade. Evidence for its efficacy comes from a few small clinical trials conducted in the 1980s. To examine more comprehensively the efficacy and safety of this formulation, we conducted two independent, identical, parallel, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, large-scale multicenter clinical trials. Healthy adults with a history of frequent herpes labialis were recruited from the general population, screened for eligibility, randomized equally to 5% acyclovir cream or vehicle control, given study medication, and told to self-initiate treatment five times daily for 4 days beginning within 1 h of the onset of a recurrent episode. The number of patients who treated a lesion was 686 in study 1 and 699 in study 2. In study 1, the mean duration of episodes was 4.3 days for patients treated with acyclovir cream and 4.8 days for those treated with the vehicle control (hazards ratio [HR] = 1.23; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.06 to 1.44; P = 0.007). In study 2, the mean duration of episodes was 4.6 days for patients treated with acyclovir cream and 5.2 days for those treated with the vehicle control (HR = 1.24; 95% CI, 1.06 to 1.44; P = 0.006). Efficacy was apparent whether therapy was initiated ""early"" (prodrome or erythema lesion stage) or ""late"" (papule or vesicle stage). There was a statistically significant reduction in the duration of lesion pain in both studies. Acyclovir cream did not prevent the development of classical lesions (progression to vesicles, ulcers, and/or crusts). Adverse events were mild and infrequent.","Topical application of 5% acyclovir cream significantly decreases clinician-assessed duration of the episode and duration of patient-reported pain, based on 2 double-blind, multicenter RCTs that used a vehicle control. In these trials, 686 and 699 patients self-initiated treatment 5 times a day for 4 days beginning within 1 hour of the onset of a recurrent lesion. In the first study, the mean clinician-assessed duration of the episode with topical acyclovir was 4.3 vs 4.8 days for placebo (hazard ratio [HR]=1.23; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.06-1.44), and the mean duration of patient-assessed pain was 2.9 vs 3.2 days (HR=1.20; 95% CI, 1.03-1.40). The second study showed a mean clinician-assessed duration with topical acyclovir of 4.6 vs 5.2 days for control (HR=1.24; 95% CI, 1.06-1.44), and the mean duration of patient-assessed pain was 3.1 vs 3.5 days (HR=1.21; 95% CI, 1.04-1.40). Benefits were seen regardless of whether treatment was initiated early (prodrome or erythema stage) or late (macule, papule, vesicle or crusted stage)."
"What medications are safe and effective for heartburn during pregnancy
A randomised crossover trial was performed in 55 pregnant women who complained of heartburn to see whether alkali or acid treatment alleviated it. Each woman was given a week's treatment with an acid mixture, an alkali mixture, and a placebo in randomised order. Both acid and alkali mixtures were better than placebo, but there was no significant difference between the acid and alkali treatments. Together with the inconsistent reports of some patients, these findings suggest that both acid reflux and bile regurgitation may cause heartburn in pregnant women and that other factors may also play a part. Because the cause of heartburn may be difficult to determine, treatment should be empirical. If the patient does not respond to seven days' acid treatment an alkali mixture should be prescribed; there is a 98% chance that one of these treatments will relieve symptoms.",Atlay and colleagues found that sodium bicarbonate significantly reduced reflux symptoms compared with placebo (P=.021; NNT=6.0).
"How effective is gastric bypass for weight loss
Obesity is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Surgery for morbid obesity may be considered when other conventional measures have failed, and a number of procedures are available. However, the effects of these surgical procedures compared with medical management and with each other are uncertain. To assess the effects of surgery for morbid obesity on weight, comorbidities and quality of life. We searched the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (issue 4, 2001), Medline (SilverPlatter) up to 2001, PubMed (Internet) 01/01/01-19/10/01, Embase (SilverPlatter) up to 09/2001, PsychINFO up to 10/2001, CINAHL (SilverPlatter) up to 07/2001, Science and Social Sciences Citation Index up to 10/12001, British Nursing Index up to 07/2001, Web of Science Proceedings up to 06/2001, BIOSIS up to10/2001, AMED up to 07/2001, National Research Register (issue 2, 2001), reference lists of relevant articles, and handsearched relevant journals. We also contacted experts in the field. Date of the most recent searches: October 2001. Randomised controlled trials comparing different surgical procedures, and randomised controlled trials and non-randomised controlled trials comparing surgery with non-surgical management for morbid obesity. Data were extracted by one reviewer and checked independently by two reviewers. Two reviewers independently assessed trial quality. 18 trials involving 1891 people were included. One randomised controlled trial and one non-randomised controlled trial compared surgery with non-surgical management, and 11 randomised controlled trials compared different surgical procedures. The overall quality of the trials was variable, with just one trial having adequate allocation concealment. A meta-analysis was not possible due to differences in the surgical procedures performed, measures of weight change and length of follow-up. Compared with conventional management, surgery resulted in greater weight loss (23-28 kg more weight loss at two years), with improvements in quality of life and comorbidities. Some complications of surgery occurred, such as wound infection. Gastric bypass was associated with greater weight loss and fewer revisions, reoperations and/or conversions than gastroplasty, but had more side-effects. Greater weight loss and fewer side-effects and reoperations occurred with adjustable gastric banding than vertical banded gastroplasty, while vertical banded gastroplasty was associated with greater weight loss but more vomiting than horizontal gastroplasty. Some postoperative deaths occurred in the studies. Weight loss was similar between open and laparoscopic procedures. Fewer serious complications occurred with laparoscopic surgery. Laparoscopic surgery had a longer operative time, but resulted in reduced blood loss, reduced proportion of patients requiring intensive care unit stay, reduced length of hospital stay, reduced days to return to activities of daily living and reduced days to return to work. The limited evidence suggests that surgery is more effective than conventional management for weight loss in morbid obesity. The comparative safety and effectiveness of different surgical procedures is unclear.","A systematic review assessed multiple randomized controlled trials comparing gastric bypass with gastroplasty and found greater weight loss, fewer revisions, and more side effects from gastric bypass. Five trials comparing gastric bypass with horizontal gastroplasty demonstrated significantly greater weight loss from gastric bypass. Five other trials comparing weight loss from gastric bypass with vertical gastroplasty produced mixed results, with 3 trials favoring gastric bypass and 2 showing no difference. Fewer patients required revision after gastric bypass (0%-4%) compared with vertical gastroplasty (9%) or horizontal gastroplasty (19%-40%). One included trial found that postoperative dumping syndrome (28% vs 0%, P<0.05) and heartburn (59% vs 32%, P<.05) were more common with gastric bypass than with gastroplasty."
"What hormonal contraception is most effective for obese wome
To examine the hypothesis that higher body weight increases the risk of oral contraceptive (OC) failure. We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis of data from 755 randomly selected female enrollees of Group Health Cooperative of Puget Sound who completed an in-person interview and dietary questionnaire between 1990 and 1994 as control subjects for a case-control study of ovarian cysts. Among the 618 women who were OC ever-users, we used Cox proportional hazards regression models to estimate the relative risk (RR) of pregnancy while using OCs associated with body weight quartile. During 2822 person-years of OC use, 106 confirmed pregnancies occurred (3.8 per 100 person-years of exposure). After controlling for parity, women in the highest body weight quartile (70.5 kg or more) had a significantly increased risk of OC failure (RR 1.6, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1, 2.4) compared with women of lower weight. Higher elevations of risk associated with the highest weight quartile were seen among very low-dose OC users (RR 4.5, 95% CI 1.4, 14.4) and low-dose OC users (RR 2.6, 95% CI 1.2, 5.9), controlling for parity, race, religion, and menstrual cycle regularity. Our findings suggest that body habitus may affect metabolism sufficiently to compromise contraceptive effectiveness. Consideration of a woman's weight may be an important element of OC prescription.","One retrospective cohort analysis found that women weighing >70.5 kg had an increased risk of pregnancy compared with women of lower weight (relative risk [RR]=1.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1-2.4), after controlling for parity. Pill compliance was not accounted for in this study."
"What's the best treatment for gestational diabetes
This study was undertaken to compare the use of glyburide with insulin for the treatment of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) unresponsive to diet therapy. A retrospective study was performed among women with singleton pregnancies who had GDM diagnosed, with fasting plasma glucose 140 mg/dL or less on glucose tolerance testing, between 12 and 34 weeks who failed diet therapy from 1999 to 2002. We identified 584 women and compared those treated with insulin between 1999 and 2000 with women treated with glyburide between 2001 and 2002. Maternal and neonatal outcomes and complications were assessed. Statistical methods included univariate analyses and multivariable logistic regression. In 1999 through 2000, 268 women had GDM diagnosed and were treated with insulin; in 2001 through 2002, 316 women had GDM diagnosed of which 236 (75%) received glyburide. The 2 groups were similar with regard to age, nulliparity, and historical GDM risk factors; however, women in the insulin group had a higher mean body mass index (31.9 vs 30.6 kg/m 2 , P=.04), a greater proportion identified themselves as white (43%, 28%, P<.001) and fewer as Asian (24%, 37%, P=.001), and they had a significantly higher mean fasting on glucose tolerance test (105.4 vs 102.4 mg/dL , P=.005) compared with the glyburide group. There were no significant differences in birth weight (3599+/-650 g vs 3661+/-629 g, P=.3), macrosomia (24%, 25%, P=.7), or cesarean delivery (35%, 39 %, P=.4). Women in the glyburide group had a higher incidence of preeclampsia (12%, 6%, P=.02), and neonates in the glyburide group were more likely to receive phototherapy (9%, 5%, P<.05), and less likely to be admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) (15%, 24%, P=.008) though they had a longer NICU length of stay (4.3+/-9.6 vs 8.0+/-10.1, P=.002). Posttreatment glycemic control data were available for 122 women treated with insulin and 137 women treated with glyburide. More women in the glyburide group achieved mean fasting and postprandial goals (86%, 63%, P<.001). These findings remained significant in logistic regression analysis. In a large managed care organization, glyburide was at least as effective as insulin in achieving glycemic control and similar birth weights in women with GDM who failed diet therapy. The increased risk of preeclampsia and phototherapy in the glyburide group warrant further study.","Similarly, a retrospective study comparing glyburide with insulin in 584 women found little difference between the 2 approaches. Women in the glyburide group had better glycemic control, but the women in the insulin group started with higher initial blood sugars. The glyburide group had fewer neonatal intensive care unit admissions than the insulin group (number needed to treat [NNT]=11), but higher rates of jaundice (number needed to harm [NNH]=25), pre-eclampsia (NNH=17), and maternal hypoglycemia (NNH=8). All other neonatal outcomes were similar between groups."
"How useful is a physical exam in diagnosing testicular torsion
To compare historical features, physical examination findings, and testicular color Doppler ultrasound in pediatric patients with epididymitis, testicular torsion, and torsion of appendix testis. A retrospective review of patients with the diagnosis of epididymitis, testicular torsion, or torsion of appendix testis. Ninety patients were included in the study (64 with epididymitis, 13 with testicular torsion, and 13 with torsion of appendix testis). Historical features did not differ among groups except for duration of symptoms. Of 13 patients with testicular torsion all had a tender testicle and an absent cremasteric reflex. When compared with the testicular torsion group, fewer patients with epididymitis had a tender testicle (69%) or an absent cremasteric reflex (14%). 62 (97%) patients with epididymitis had a tender epididymis and 43 (67%) had scrotal erythema/edema. By comparison, 3 (23%) and 5 (38%) patients with testicular torsion had a tender epididymis or scrotal erythema/edema, respectively. Doppler ultrasound showed decreased or absent blood flow in 8 patients, 7 of whom were diagnosed with testicular torsion. Ten out of 13 patients with testicular torsion had a salvageable testicle at the time of surgery. The physical examination is helpful in distinguishing among epididymitis, testicular torsion, and torsion of appendix testis. Patients presenting with a tender testicle and an absent cremasteric reflex were more likely to have a testicular torsion rather than epididymitis or torsion of appendix testis. An absent cremasteric reflex was the most sensitive physical finding for diagnosing testicular torsion. Color Doppler ultrasound is a useful adjunct in the evaluation of the acute scrotum when physical findings are equivocal.","A retrospective study reviewed the records of 90 hospitalized patients, 18 years or younger, who were discharged with a diagnosis of testicular torsion, epididymitis, or torsion appendix testis. The cremasteric reflex was absent, and testicular tenderness present, in all 13 patients with testicular torsion."
"What are the risks and benefits of elective induction for uncomplicated term pregnancies
This study was undertaken to examine associations between induction of labor and maternal and neonatal outcomes among women without an identified indication for induction. This was a population-based cohort study of 2886 women with induced labor and 9648 women with spontaneous labor who were delivered at 37 to 41 weeks' gestation, all without identified medical and obstetric indications for induction. Among nulliparous women 19% of women with induced labor versus 10% of those with spontaneous labor underwent cesarean delivery (adjusted relative risk, 1.77; 95% confidence interval, 1.50-2.08). No association was seen in multiparous women (relative risk, 1.07; 95% confidence interval, 0. 81-1.39). Among all women induction was associated with modest increases in instrumental delivery (19% vs 15%; relative risk, 1.20; 95% confidence interval, 1.09-1.32) and shoulder dystocia (3.0% vs 1. 7%; relative risk, 1.32; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-1.69). Among women who lacked an identified indication for induction of labor, induction was associated with increased likelihood of cesarean delivery for nulliparous but not multiparous women and with modest increases in the risk of instrumental delivery and shoulder dystocia for all women.","A large population-based study suggests that the higher cesarean section rates in elective induction is present only among nulliparous women; in multiparous women, the rate is the same as expectant management."
"How accurate is the use of ECGs in the diagnosis of myocardial infarct
We sought to evaluate quantitatively the evidence on the diagnostic performance of out-of-hospital ECG for the diagnosis of acute cardiac ischemia (ACI) and acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and the clinical effect of out-of-hospital thrombolysis. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the English-language literature published between 1966 and December 1998 on the diagnostic accuracy of out-of-hospital ECG and the clinical effect of out-of-hospital thrombolysis. Both prospective and retrospective studies qualified for the assessment of diagnostic performance. For clinical effect, data from prospective nonrandomized studies were synthesized separately from data from randomized trials. Diagnostic performance was assessed by using estimates of test sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic odds ratios and was summarized by using summary receiver-operating characteristic curves. Measures of clinical effect included time savings, early ventricular function, early mortality, and long-term survival. Diagnostic accuracy was evaluated in 11 studies with a total of 7,508 patients. Data were available for ACI in 5 studies and for AMI in 8 studies. For ACI, the random-effects pooled sensitivity was 76% (95% CI, 54% to 89%), the specificity was 88% (95% CI, 67% to 96%), and the diagnostic odds ratio was 23 (95% CI, 6.3 to 85). The respective figures for AMI were sensitivity of 68% (95% CI, 59% to 76%), specificity of 97% (95% CI, 89% to 92%), and diagnostic odds ratio of 104 (95% CI, 48 to 224). Both in nonrandomized (n=4, total 1,531 patients) and randomized (n=9, total 6,643 patients) studies, out-of-hospital thrombolysis shortened the time from onset of symptoms to thrombolytic treatment by 40 to 60 minutes. Data on short-term ejection fraction were sparse. Hospital mortality was reduced by 16% (95% CI, 2% to 27%) among randomized trials, and a similar estimate of effect was seen in nonrandomized studies. There was no clear effect on long-term mortality, but data were sparse. Out-of-hospital ECG has excellent diagnostic performance for AMI and very good performance for ACI. Out-of-hospital thrombolysis achieves time savings and improves short-term mortality, but the effect on long-term mortality is unknown.","In 2001, a working group of the National Heart Attack Alert Program (NHAAP) performed a systematic review to define the accuracy of ""out of hospital"" electrocardiogram in the diagnosis of acute cardiac ischemia (ACI) and MI. Based on the 8 studies for which data were available, the random effects pooled sensitivity for acute myocardial infarction was 68% (95% CI, 59%-76%), the specificity was 97% (95% CI, 89%-92%), and the diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) was 104 (95% CI, 48-224)."
"What is the most effective beta-blocker for heart failure
Although beta-adrenergic-receptor antagonists reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with mild-to-moderate chronic heart failure, their effect on survival in patients with more advanced heart failure is unknown. A total of 2708 patients with heart failure designated as New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class III (in 92 percent of the patients) or IV (in 8 percent) and a left ventricular ejection fraction of 35 percent or lower were randomly assigned to double-blind treatment with either bucindolol (1354 patients) or placebo (1354 patients) and followed for the primary end point of death from any cause. The data and safety monitoring board recommended stopping the trial after the seventh interim analysis. At that time, there was no significant difference in mortality between the two groups (unadjusted P=0.16). The results presented here are based on complete follow-up at the time of study termination (average, 2.0 years). There were a total of 449 deaths in the placebo group (33 percent) and 411 deaths in the bucindolol group (30 percent; adjusted P=0.13). The risk of the secondary end point of death from cardiovascular causes was lower in the bucindolol group (hazard ratio, 0.86; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.74 to 0.99), as was the risk of heart transplantation or death (hazard ratio, 0.87; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.77 to 0.99). In a demographically diverse group of patients with NYHA class III and IV heart failure, bucindolol resulted in no significant overall survival benefit.","In contrast, the Beta-Blocker Evaluation of Survival Trial (BEST) demonstrated no effect with bucindolol."
"Heat or ice for acute ankle sprain
The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of cold, heat, and contrast bath treatments on the amount of edema in first- and second-degree sprained ankles during the postacute phase of rehabilitation. Thirty subjects with postacute sprained ankles were assigned to a cold (n = 10), heat (n = 10), or contrast bath (n = 10) treatment group. A specially constructed tank was used to take pretreatment and posttreatment volumetric measurements of subjects' sprained ankles. Descriptive statistics, a 3 x 3 two-way analysis of variance for repeated measures, and Tukey's Honestly Significant Difference post hoc test revealed that cold therapy produced the least edema in subjects with sprained ankles (p less than .05). All three treatments (cold, heat, and contrast bath) produced an increase in the amount of edema in the postacute sprained ankles of the subjects. Heat and contrast bath therapy produced almost identical increases in the amount of ankle edema on each of the three days of the study. We concluded that cold therapy is the most appropriate of the three treatments if the therapeutic objective is to minimize edema before rehabilitative exercise during the third, fourth, and fifth days postinjury for first- and second-degree ankle sprains.","The application of ice-but not heat-within 24 to 48 hours of acute ankle sprain also reduced edema. Several studies looked at reduction of edema with cooling. One study measured edema in 30 patients with grade 1 and 2 sprains treated with cold, heat, or contrast baths during the third, fourth, and fifth days. Only ice therapy alone significantly reduced edema."
"What is the best hypnotic for use in the elderly
Insomnia is a frequent complaint in the elderly population. Hypnotic agents, including benzodiazepines, with longer pharmacological half-lives have been associated with side effects, including residual sedation, memory impairment, and discontinuation effects. Zaleplon is a short-acting (elimination half-life of 1 hour), non-benzodiazepine hypnotic that acts on the benzodiazepine type 1 site of the gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA(A)) receptor complex. The pharmacology and pharmacokinetics of Zaleplon suggest a safety profile that is improved over other hypnotics. The objective of this placebo-controlled study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Zaleplon (5 and 10 mg) in elderly (> or =65 years) outpatients with primary insomnia. This was a multicenter, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled 2-week outpatient study. Postsleep questionnaires were used to record subjective sleep variables: sleep latency, sleep duration, number of awakenings, and sleep quality. Zaleplon significantly reduced subjective sleep latency during both weeks of the study with both 5- and 10-mg doses. Subjective sleep quality was improved for significantly more patients treated with zaleplon 10 mg than those treated with placebo during both weeks of treatment. There was a weak indication of rebound insomnia after discontinuation of treatment with the 10-mg dose, but no significant difference in common treatment-emergent adverse events across treatment groups. Zaleplon is an effective and safe hypnotic for the treatment of insomnia in the elderly.",Comparative studies in the elderly have demonstrated that zaleplon is more effective than placebo at decreasing sleep latency and improving sleep quality.
"Does early detection of suspected atherosclerotic renovascular hypertension change outcomes
Patients with hypertension and renal-artery stenosis are often treated with percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty. However, the long-term effects of this procedure on blood pressure are not well understood. We randomly assigned 106 patients with hypertension who had atherosclerotic renal-artery stenosis (defined as a decrease in luminal diameter of 50 percent or more) and a serum creatinine concentration of 2.3 mg per deciliter (200 micromol per liter) or less to undergo percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty or to receive drug therapy. To be included, patients also had to have a diastolic blood pressure of 95 mm Hg or higher despite treatment with two antihypertensive drugs or an increase of at least 0.2 mg per deciliter (20 micromol per liter) in the serum creatinine concentration during treatment with an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor. Blood pressure, doses of antihypertensive drugs, and renal function were assessed at 3 and 12 months, and patency of the renal artery was assessed at 12 months. At base line, the mean (+/-SD) systolic and diastolic blood pressures were 179+/-25 and 104+/-10 mm Hg, respectively, in the angioplasty group and 180+/-23 and 103+/-8 mm Hg, respectively, in the drug-therapy group. At three months, the blood pressures were similar in the two groups (169+/-28 and 99+/-12 mm Hg, respectively, in the 56 patients in the angioplasty group and 176+/-31 and 101+/-14 mm Hg, respectively, in the 50 patients in the drug-therapy group; P=0.25 for the comparison of systolic pressure and P=0.36 for the comparison of diastolic pressure between the two groups); at the time, patients in the angioplasty group were taking 2.1+/-1.3 defined daily doses of medication and those in the drug-therapy group were taking 3.2+/-1.5 daily doses (P<0.001). In the drug-therapy group, 22 patients underwent balloon angioplasty after three months because of persistent hypertension despite treatment with three or more drugs or because of a deterioration in renal function. According to intention-to-treat analysis, at 12 months, there were no significant differences between the angioplasty and drug-therapy groups in systolic and diastolic blood pressures, daily drug doses, or renal function. In the treatment of patients with hypertension and renal-artery stenosis, angioplasty has little advantage over antihypertensive-drug therapy.","One randomized controlled trials of 106 patients with atherosclerotic RAS and serum creatinine (Cr) of <2.3 mg/dL compared percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty with medical therapy of hypertension. By an intentionto-treat analysis, there was no significant difference in renal function at 12 months between the groups."
"When should COX-2 selective NSAIDs be used for osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis
Editor's note: The anti-inflammatory drug rofecoxib (Vioxx) was withdrawn from the market at the end of September 2004 after it was shown that long-term use (greater than 18 months) could increase the risk of heart attack and stroke. Further information is available at www.vioxx.com. Osteoarthritis is a chronic disease of the joints, characterised by joint pain, stiffness and loss of physical function. Its onset is age-related and occurs usually between the ages of 50 and 60. It is the commonest cause of disability in those aged over 65, with OA of the knee and/or hip affecting over 20 per cent of the elderly population. To establish the efficacy and safety of rofecoxib in the management of OA by systematic review of available evidence. We searched the following databases up to August 2004: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, National Research Register, NHS Economic Evaluation Database, Health Technology Assessment Database. The bibliographies of retrieved papers and content experts were consulted for additional references. All eligible randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were included. No unpublished RCTs were included in this edition of the review. Data were abstracted independently by two reviewers. A validated checklist was used to score the quality of the RCTs. Comparable trials were pooled using fixed effects model. Twenty-six RCTs were included. The comparators were placebo, diclofenac, ibuprofen, naproxen, nimesulide, nabumetone, paracetamol, celecoxib and Arthrotec. The evidence reviewed indicated that rofecoxib was more effective than placebo (patient global response RR 1.75 95% CI: 1.35, 2.26) but was associated with more adverse events (RR 1.32 95% CI 1.11, 1.56). There were no consistent differences in efficacy between rofecoxib and any of the active comparators at equivalent doses. Endoscopic studies indicated that compared to ibuprofen 800 mg three times a day, rofecoxib caused fewer erosions and gastric ulcers at doses of 25mg and 50mg; the difference in duodenal ulcers was evident only at a dose of 25mg. Rofecoxib 50mg also caused more endoscopically observed ulcers greater than rofecoxib 25mg (RR 2.48 CI: 1.21, 5.11). Very few of the trials reported overall rates of GI adverse events although rofecoxib was found to cause fewer GI events than naproxen. Only one of the nine trials comparing rofecoxib to celecoxib reported on the overall rates of GI events and this was a comparison of the higher recommended dose of rofecoxib with the lower recommended dose of celecoxib. Similarly, the three trials in older hypertensive patients that examined the cardiovascular safety of rofecoxib and celecoxib used non-comparable doses; the results of these studies indicated that rofecoxib caused more patients to have oedema and a clinically significant increase in systolic blood pressure. This difference between rofecoxib and celecoxib was not evident in studies conducted in more general populations. Rofecoxib was voluntarily withdrawn from global markets in October 2004 therefore there are no implications for practice concerning its use. There remains a number of questions over both the benefits and risks associated with Cox II selective agents and further work is ongoing.","A Cochrane review (26 randomized controlled trials) found that rofecoxib (Vioxx) was more effective than placebo (NNT=5), and equally effective with other NSAIDs in the management of osteoarthritis. They reported fewer gastrointestinal adverse events (endoscopically observed gastric erosion and ulcers) with rofecoxib than with other NSAIDs-naproxen (Naprosyn), ibuprofen (Motrin), diclofenac (Cataflam), nabumetone (Relafen), diclofenac/misoprostol (Arthrotec), and nimesulide. However, the withdrawal rate due to adverse events and the increase in blood pressure and edema were significantly greater with rofecoxib than placebo at 6 weeks."
"How do you evaluate macrocytosis without anemia
The most common causes of macrocytic anemias in the adults are (1) alcoholism, (2) liver diseases, (3) hemolysis or bleeding, (4) hypothyroidism, (5) folate or vitamin B12 deficiency, (6) exposure to chemotherapy and other drugs, and (7) myelodysplasia. A carefully obtained history and examination with evaluation of a peripheral blood smear and reticulocyte count should be performed in most patients with macrocytosis. Serum vitamin B12 and folate levels, serum thyroid studies, liver function studies, and bone marrow aspirate and biopsy with cytogenetic analysis are frequently required to confirm a diagnosis suspected on the basis of the initial evaluation.","A history focusing specifically on alcohol use and medications-especially chemotherapeutics, antiretroviral drugs, and antiseizure medications-can provide important clues to the cause of macrocytosis. During the physical examination, look for signs consistent with chronic liver disease."
"What is the appropriate use of sunscreen for infants and children
The IARC convened a working group of experts in Lyon, France, on 10-18 April, 2000, to evaluate the cancer-preventive activity of sunscreens and to compile the fifth volume of the IARC Handbooks of Cancer Prevention. The working group concluded that the topical use of sunscreens reduces the risk of sunburn in humans and that sunscreens probably prevent squamous-cell carcinoma of the skin when used mainly during unintentional sun exposure. No conclusion can be drawn about the cancer-preventive activity of topical use of sunscreens against basal-cell carcinoma and cutaneous melanoma. Use of sunscreens can extend the duration of intentional sun exposure, such as sunbathing. Such an extension may increase the risk for cutaneous melanoma. The working group warned against relying solely on sunscreens for protection from UV radiation.","Case-control studies demonstrate that sunburn in childhood raises the risk of melanotic and nonmelanotic skin cancers, particularly among those with fair skin."
"Do endovascular filters prevent pulmonary embolism  as effectively as anticoagulants in patients with deep venous thrombosis
Pulmonary emboli can have potentially fatal consequences. Inferior vena caval filters are metal alloy devices that mechanically trap fragmented thromboemboli from the deep leg veins en route to the pulmonary circulation. Filters in current clinical use are designed to be introduced (and in the case of retrievable filters, removed) percutaneously. Although their deployment seems of theoretical benefit, their clinical efficacy and adverse event profile is unclear. To examine evidence for the effectiveness of vena caval filters in preventing pulmonary embolism (PE). Secondary outcomes were mortality, distal (to filter) thrombosis, and filter-related complications. We searched the Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group Specialised Register (last searched August 2007), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library 2007, Issue 3, MEDLINE (1966 to August 2007), and EMBASE (1966 to August 2007). Filter manufacturers and clinicians interested in filters were contacted for information. Controlled clinical trials (CCTs) and randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that examined the efficacy of filters in preventing PE were selected. Three authors extracted information independently. Incidence figures were extracted from survival tables. Dichotomous outcomes were analysed as hazard ratio estimates. One RCT was included. The PREPIC (Prévention du Risque d'Embolie Pulmonaire par Interruption Cave) trial was an open RCT of 400 participants with documented proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or PE and who received concurrent anticoagulation. Permanent caval filters prevented PE at eight years (HR 0.37, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.79, in favour of the filter). No reduction in mortality was seen, but this reflected an older study population (mean age 73 years); the majority of deaths were due to cancer or cardiovascular causes. There was an increased incidence of DVT in the filter group (HR 1.52, 95% CI 1.02 to 2.27). No details were recorded of adverse events of filters. Limited generalisability prevents any conclusions to be drawn from the PREPIC trial in that permanent filters were used and the study lacked statistical power to detect a reduction in PE over shorter and more clinically significant time periods. However, the PREPIC trial demonstrated that permanent caval filters were associated with an increased risk of long term lower limb DVT. There is a marked paucity of caval filter outcomes evidence when used within their currently approved indications. There is also a lack of retrievable filter trials. Further trials are needed to assess vena caval filter safety and effectiveness.",The study lacked statistical power to draw any conclusion about the efficacy of IVCFs in preventing pulmonary embolism  over shorter time periods or in reducing PE-related or overall mortality.
"What is the best therapy for superficial thrombophlebitis
The efficacy and safety of antithrombotic treatment in patients with superficial vein thrombosis remain to be established in adequately designed trials. In a double-blind trial, 427 patients older than 18 years, with documented acute symptomatic superficial vein thrombosis of the legs, were randomly assigned to receive subcutaneous enoxaparin sodium, 40 mg; subcutaneous enoxaparin, 1.5 mg/kg; oral tenoxicam; or placebo, once daily for 8 to 12 days. The primary efficacy outcome was deep venous thromboembolism between days 1 and 12, defined as deep vein thrombosis detected by ultrasonography between days 8 and 12 or earlier if clinically indicated, or documented symptomatic pulmonary embolism. For the secondary efficacy outcomes, superficial vein thrombosis recurrence or extension was also considered. The incidence of deep venous thromboembolism by day 12 was 3.6% (4 of 111 patients) in the placebo group, 0.9% (1 of 109 patients) in the 40-mg enoxaparin group (P =.37 vs placebo), 1.0% (1 of 102 patients) in the 1.5-mg/kg enoxaparin group (P =.37 vs placebo), and 2.1% (2 of 94 patients) in the tenoxicam group (P =.69 vs placebo). The incidence of deep and superficial venous thromboembolism by day 12 was significantly reduced in all active treatment groups, from 30.6% (34 of 111 patients) in the placebo group to 8.3% (9 of 109 patients), 6.9% (7 of 102 patients), and 14.9% (14 of 94 patients) in the 40-mg enoxaparin (P<.001), 1.5-mg/kg enoxaparin (P<.001), and tenoxicam (P<.01) groups, respectively. No death or major hemorrhage occurred during the study. Treatment with a low-molecular-weight heparin or with an oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent should be evaluated further in the prevention of thromboembolic complications in patients with superficial vein thrombosis.","One large double-blind randomized controlled trial compared tenoxicam (an nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs available in Canada, similar to piroxicam), enoxaparin (Lovenox), and placebo for 8 to 12 days in 427 patients with superficial venous thrombophlebitis of the leg measuring 5 cm or more. Patients were also treated with compression hose. Patients who required immediate anticoagulation or venous ligation were excluded. Within 3 months, 35% of patients taking placebo developed an extension or recurrence of their superficial venous thrombophlebitis or a DVT, compared with 16% to 17% of treated patients (NNT=6). There was no significant difference in outcome between subcutaneous enoxaparin at fixed (40 mg/d) or adjusted doses (1.5 mg/kg), or 20 mg/d oral tenoxicam."
"What is the best approach to prevention and treatment of osteoporosis
Risedronate increases bone mineral density in elderly women, but whether it prevents hip fracture is not known. We studied 5445 women 70 to 79 years old who had osteoporosis (indicated by a T score for bone mineral density at the femoral neck that was more than 4 SD below the mean peak value in young adults [-4] or lower than -3 plus a nonskeletal risk factor for hip fracture, such as poor gait or a propensity to fall) and 3886 women at least 80 years old who had at least one nonskeletal risk factor for hip fracture or low bone mineral density at the femoral neck (T score, lower than -4 or lower than -3 plus a hip-axis length of 11.1 cm or greater). The women were randomly assigned to receive treatment with oral risedronate (2.5 or 5.0 mg daily) or placebo for three years. The primary end point was the occurrence of hip fracture. Overall, the incidence of hip fracture among all the women assigned to risedronate was 2.8 percent, as compared with 3.9 percent among those assigned to placebo (relative risk, 0.7; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.6 to 0.9; P=0.02). In the group of women with osteoporosis (those 70 to 79 years old), the incidence of hip fracture among those assigned to risedronate was 1.9 percent, as compared with 3.2 percent among those assigned to placebo (relative risk, 0.6; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.4 to 0.9; P=0.009). In the group of women selected primarily on the basis of nonskeletal risk factors (those at least 80 years of age), the incidence of hip fracture was 4.2 percent among those assigned to risedronate and 5.1 percent among those assigned to placebo (P=0.35). Risedronate significantly reduces the risk of hip fracture among elderly women with confirmed osteoporosis but not among elderly women selected primarily on the basis of risk factors other than low bone mineral density.","Alendronate and risedronate have both reduced vertebral and nonvertebral fractures and increased bone mineral density in clinical trials. The pooled risk estimates for alendronate's antifracture effect are 48% to 53% vertebral and hip fracture reduction and 30% reduction of all clinical fractures (relative risk [RR] = 0.70; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.59-0.82).1 Risedronate reduced hip fractures in osteoporotic women aged 70 to 79 years (RR = 0.6; 95% CI, 0.4-0.9), but women 80 years and older with nonskeletal risk factors did not benefit."
"Do antipyretics prolong febrile illness
To determine whether antipyretic therapy prolongs the course of experimental influenza A, Shigella sonnei, and Rickettsia rickettsii infections. Retrospective observational study. University Center for Vaccine Development. Fifty-four volunteers with experimentally induced influenza A, 45 with S. sonnei, and 21 with R. rickettsii infections participated. Subjects from the six influenza A studies were challenged intranasally. If they met certain criteria, they were offered aspirin or acetaminophen for symptomatic relief. Subjects from the three Shigella studies were challenged with the bacteria and then given trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole. Acetaminophen also could be administered. In the one R. rickettsii trial, subjects were inoculated intradermally and treated with tetracycline. Again, acetaminophen was administered for symptomatic relief. Data, excerpted from subjects' study records, were evaluated using Wilcoxon tests, Spearman's correlation coefficients, and multiple regression analysis. Two-tailed hypotheses with a p value of 0.05 were used for all of the analyses. There was a striking correlation between antipyretic therapy and duration of illness in subjects infected with influenza A and S. sonnei, but not R. rickettsii. Multivariate analysis suggested that antipyretic therapy prolonged illness in subjects infected with influenza A, but its use was the result of prolonged illness in those infected with S. sonnei. The precise nature of these relationships requires a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled trial.","In a retrospective observational study of 54 volunteers, antipyretics were associated with a trend towards prolonged duration of illness in a group of 21 patients infected with S sonnei (4.6 ± 2.1 days with antipyretics vs 1.9 ± 1.6 days without; P=not significant)."
"What is the appropriate use of sunscreen for infants and children
Originally developed to protect against sunburn, sunscreen has been assumed to prevent skin cancer. However, conflicting reports include claims that sunscreen increases risk for melanoma. To examine the strength and consistency of associations between melanoma and sunscreen use in the published literature. A comprehensive MEDLINE search of articles published from 1966 to 2003 that reported information on sunscreen use and melanoma in humans. Analytic studies reporting data on sunscreen use before diagnosis of melanoma. Two independent reviewers extracted data. Inconsistencies were rereviewed until agreement was achieved. When necessary, a third party resolved discrepancies. Odds ratios were pooled across studies by using standard meta-analytic techniques. Pooled odds ratios for ever use among 18 heterogeneous studies did not support an association between melanoma and sunscreen use. Variation among odds ratios was explained by studies that did not adjust for confounding effects of sun sensitivity. The lack of a dose-response effect with frequency of use (never, sometimes, or always) or years of use provided further evidence of a null association. No association was seen between melanoma and sunscreen use. Failure to control for confounding factors may explain previous reports of positive associations linking melanoma to sunscreen use. In addition, it may take decades to detect a protective association between melanoma and use of the newer formulations of sunscreens.",A meta-analysis of 18 observational studies did not show an association between sunscreen use and melanoma incidence.
"Does physical therapy improve symptoms of fibromyalgia
To determine the effectiveness of self-management education and physical training in decreasing fibromyalgia (FMS) symptoms and increasing physical and psychological well being. A pretest-posttest control group design was used. Ninety-nine women with FMS were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups; 86 completed the study. The education only group received a 6-week self-management course. The education plus physical training group received the course and 6 h of training designed to assist them to exercise independently. The control group got treatment after 3 months. The experimental programs had a significant positive impact on quality of life and self-efficacy. Helplessness, number of days feeling bad, physical dysfunction, and pain in the tender points decreased significantly in one or both of the treated groups when retested 6 weeks after the end of the program. Longterm followup of 67 treated subjects showed significant positive changes on the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire primarily in the physical training group. Among all subjects, 87% were exercising at least 3 times/week for 20 min or more; 46% said they had increased their exercise level since participating in the program; 70% were practicing relaxation strategies as needed; 46% were working at least half time as opposed to 37% at pretest. Self-efficacy of the treated groups was enhanced significantly by the program. Other changes were smaller and more delayed than had been expected. Recommendations for future trials include a longer education program, more vigorous physical training, and longterm followup.","A trial randomized 99 patients to 3 groups: education and cognitive behavioral therapy; education, cognitive behavioral therapy and exercise; or a wait-list control group. At the 6-month follow-up, the education group scored significantly higher than the others-but only on self-reported measures of daily functioning and self-efficacy."
"What does the evidence tell us about treating very-high-risk patients to an low density lipoprotein <70 mg/dL
Previous trials have demonstrated that lowering low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels below currently recommended levels is beneficial in patients with acute coronary syndromes. We prospectively assessed the efficacy and safety of lowering LDL cholesterol levels below 100 mg per deciliter (2.6 mmol per liter) in patients with stable coronary heart disease (CHD). A total of 10,001 patients with clinically evident CHD and LDL cholesterol levels of less than 130 mg per deciliter (3.4 mmol per liter) were randomly assigned to double-blind therapy and received either 10 mg or 80 mg of atorvastatin per day. Patients were followed for a median of 4.9 years. The primary end point was the occurrence of a first major cardiovascular event, defined as death from CHD, nonfatal non-procedure-related myocardial infarction, resuscitation after cardiac arrest, or fatal or nonfatal stroke. The mean LDL cholesterol levels were 77 mg per deciliter (2.0 mmol per liter) during treatment with 80 mg of atorvastatin and 101 mg per deciliter (2.6 mmol per liter) during treatment with 10 mg of atorvastatin. The incidence of persistent elevations in liver aminotransferase levels was 0.2 percent in the group given 10 mg of atorvastatin and 1.2 percent in the group given 80 mg of atorvastatin (P<0.001). A primary event occurred in 434 patients (8.7 percent) receiving 80 mg of atorvastatin, as compared with 548 patients (10.9 percent) receiving 10 mg of atorvastatin, representing an absolute reduction in the rate of major cardiovascular events of 2.2 percent and a 22 percent relative reduction in risk (hazard ratio, 0.78; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.69 to 0.89; P<0.001). There was no difference between the two treatment groups in overall mortality. Intensive lipid-lowering therapy with 80 mg of atorvastatin per day in patients with stable CHD provides significant clinical benefit beyond that afforded by treatment with 10 mg of atorvastatin per day. This occurred with a greater incidence of elevated aminotransferase levels.",The safety and tolerability of higher and standard statin doses are similar.
"What is the most effective treatment for external genital warts
Four hundred and fifty patients were enrolled into a randomised clinical trial in a public sexually transmitted diseases clinic to evaluate the efficacy of podophyllin, cryotherapy, and electrodesiccation for treatment of external genital warts. Complete clearance of warts was observed in 41%, 79%, and 94% of patients who received up to six weekly treatments of podophyllin, cryotherapy, and electrodesiccation, respectively. Relapses occurred in 25% of all patients, yielding 3 month clearance rates of 17%, 55%, and 71% for podophyllin, cryotherapy, and electrodesiccation, respectively. Wart volume and duration did not influence treatment outcome. Response to therapy was greater in women than in men, and did not differ by treatment modality. Electrodesiccation and cryotherapy were more effective than podophyllin for the treatment of external genital warts, but none of these three treatments were highly successful.",Cryotherapy is equivalent to electrosurgery.
"What is the best strategy for monitoring the lipid-lowering effects of medical therapy used for the primary prevention of coronary artery disease coronary artery disease
The first report from the Framingham Study that demonstrated an inverse relationship between high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and the incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD) was based on four years of surveillance. These participants, aged 49 to 82 years, have now been followed up for 12 years, and this report shows that the relationship between the fasting HDL-C level and subsequent incidence of CHD does not diminish appreciably with time. Since a second measurement of HDL-C is available eight years after the initial determination, the relationship of HDL-C measurements on the same subjects at two points in time is examined. This second HDL-C measurement is also used in a multivariate model that includes cigarette smoking, relative weight, alcohol consumption, casual blood glucose, total cholesterol, and blood pressure. It is concluded that even after these adjustments, nonfasting HDL-C and total cholesterol levels are related to development of CHD in both men and women aged 49 years and older. Study participants at the 80th percentile of HDL-C were found to have half the risk of CHD developing when compared with subjects at the 20th percentile of HDL-C.",The Framingham Study confirmed the usefulness of total cholesterol and HDL-C in assessing risk.
"Should patients receive 23-valent pneumococcal vaccination more than once
To determine pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine efficacy in selected populations at risk for serious pneumococcal infection for whom vaccination is currently recommended and to assess duration of protection after vaccination. Vaccine efficacy was estimated using indirect cohort analysis to compare the proportion of pneumococcal infections caused by serotypes included in the vaccines of vaccinated and unvaccinated persons who were identified during 14 years of national surveillance. Hospital laboratories in the United States that submitted pneumococcal isolates to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention between May 1978 and April 1992. A total of 2837 persons older than 5 years who had pneumococcus isolated from blood or cerebrospinal fluid. Overall efficacy for preventing infection caused by serotypes included in the vaccine was 57% (95% confidence interval [CI], 45% to 66%). Efficacy among persons with diabetes mellitus was 84% (95% CI, 50% to 95%); with coronary vascular disease, 73% (95% CI, 23% to 90%); with congestive heart failure, 69% (95% CI, 17% to 88%); with chronic pulmonary diseases, 65% (95% CI, 26% to 83%); and with anatomic asplenia, 77% (95% CI, 14% to 95%). Efficacy was not documented for patients with alcoholism or cirrhosis, sickle cell disease, chronic renal failure, lymphoma, leukemia, or multiple myeloma, although sample sizes were small for these groups. Efficacy for immunocompetent persons older than 65 years was 75% (95% CI, 57% to 85%). Efficacy did not decline with increasing interval after vaccination: 5 to 8 years after vaccination it was 71% (95% CI, 24% to 89%), and 9 years or more after vaccination it was 80% (95% CI, 16% to 95%). Intensified efforts to improve pneumococcal vaccine coverage among certain populations for whom vaccination is currently recommended is indicated, but universal revaccination is not warranted at this time.","Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common cause of community-acquired pneumonia and the second most common cause of bacterial meningitis in the United States.

"What is the most effective treatment for acute low back pain
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are the most frequently prescribed medications worldwide and are widely used for patients with low back pain. The objective of this systematic review was to assess the effects of NSAIDs in the treatment of non-specific low back pain and to assess which type of NSAID is most effective. We searched the Medline and Embase databases and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (CCTR) up to and including September 1998 if reported in English, Dutch or German. We also screened references given in relevant reviews and identified trials. Randomised trials and double-blind controlled trials of NSAIDs in non-specific low back pain with or without radiation were included. Two reviewers blinded with respect to authors, institution and journal independently extracted data and assessed methodological quality. A methodological quality score was applied, and studies meeting at least six of 11 specified criteria were considered high quality studies. If data were considered clinically homogeneous, a meta-analysis was performed using a fixed effects model for statistically homogeneous subgroups and a random effects model for statistically heterogeneous subgroups. If data were considered clinically heterogeneous, a qualitative analysis was performed using a rating system with four levels of evidence (strong, moderate, limited, no). A total of 51 trials (total number of patients = 6057) were included in this review, of which 46 were published in English and five in German. Sixteen trials (31%) were of high quality. The pooled Relative Risk for global improvement after one week was 1.24 (95% CI 1.10, 1.41) and for additional analgesic use 1.29 (95% CI 1.05, 1.57), indicating a statistically significant effect in favour of NSAIDs compared to placebo. The results of the qualitative analysis showed that there is conflicting evidence (level 3) that NSAIDs are more effective than paracetamol for acute low back pain, and that there is moderate evidence (level 2) that NSAIDs are not more effective than other drugs for acute low back pain. There is strong evidence (level 1) that various types of NSAIDs are equally effective for acute low back pain. In conclusion, the evidence from the 51 trials included in this review suggests that NSAIDs are effective for short-term symptomatic relief in patients with acute low back pain. Furthermore, there does not seem to be a specific type of NSAID which is clearly more effective than others. Sufficient evidence on chronic low back pain is still lacking.",A recent systematic review found NSAIDs more effective than placebo for pain relief in patients with acute low back pain.
"Which healthy adults should take aspirin
This report presents final 1999 data on U.S. deaths and death rates according to demographic and medical characteristics. Trends and patterns in general mortality, life expectancy, and infant and maternal mortality are also described. A previous report presented preliminary mortality data for 1999. In 1999 a total of 2,391,399 deaths were reported in the United States. This report presents tabulations of information reported on the death certificates completed by funeral directors, attending physicians, medical examiners, and coroners. Original records are filed in the State registration offices. Statistical information is compiled into a national data base through the Vital Statistics Cooperative Program of the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. For the first time in a final mortality data report, age-adjusted death rates are based upon the year 2000 population and causes of death are processed in accordance with the Tenth Revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10). The 1999 age-adjusted death rate for the United States was 881.9 deaths per 100,000 standard population, a 0.7 percent increase from the 1998 rate, and life expectancy at birth remained the same at 76.7 years. For all causes of death, age-specific death rates rose for those 45-54 years, 75-84 years, and 85 years and over and declined for a number of age groups including those 5-14 years, 55-64 years, and 65-74 years. Aortic aneurysm and dissection made its debut in the list of leading causes of death and atherosclerosis exited from the list. Heart disease and cancer continued to be the leading and second leading causes of death. The age-adjusted death rate for firearm injuries decreased for the sixth consecutive year, declining 6.2 percent between 1998 and 1999. The infant mortality rate, 7.1 infant deaths per 1,000 live births, was not statistically different from the rate in 1998. Generally, mortality continued long-term trends. Life expectancy in 1999 was unchanged from 1998 despite a slight increase in the age-adjusted death rate from the record low achieved in 1998. Although statistically unchanged from 1998, the trend in infant mortality has been of a steady but slowing decline. Some mortality measures for women and persons 85 years and over worsened between 1998 and 1999.","The leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States is cardiovascular disease (ischemic CHD, stroke, peripheral vascular disease)."
"What is the target for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in patients with heart disease
Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is associated with excellent short-term improvements in ischemic symptoms, yet only three fifths of PCI patients at 5 years and one third of patients at 10 years remain free of major adverse cardiac events (MACE). To determine whether treatment with fluvastatin reduces MACE in patients who have undergone PCI. Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted at 77 referral centers in Europe, Canada, and Brazil. A total of 1677 patients (aged 18-80 years) recruited between April 1996 and October 1998 with stable or unstable angina or silent ischemia following successful completion of their first PCI who had baseline total cholesterol levels between 135 and 270 mg/dL (3.5-7.0 mmol/L), with fasting triglyceride levels of less than 400 mg/dL (4.5 mmol/L). Patients were randomly assigned to receive treatment with fluvastatin, 80 mg/d (n = 844), or matching placebo (n = 833) at hospital discharge for 3 to 4 years. Survival time free of MACE, defined as cardiac death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or reintervention procedure, compared between the treatment and placebo groups. Median time between PCI and first dose of study medication was 2.0 days, and median follow-up was 3.9 years. MACE-free survival time was significantly longer in the fluvastatin group (P =.01). One hundred eighty-one (21.4%) of 844 patients in the fluvastatin group and 222 (26.7%) of 833 patients in the placebo group had at least 1 MACE (relative risk [RR], 0.78; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.64-0.95; P =.01). This result was independent of baseline total cholesterol levels (above [RR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.56-1.04] vs below [RR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.57-1.02] the median). In subgroup analysis, the risk of MACE was reduced in patients with diabetes (n = 202; RR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.29-0.97; P =.04) and in those with multivessel disease (n = 614; RR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.48-0.91; P =.01) who received fluvastatin compared with those who received placebo. There were no instances of creatine phosphokinase elevations 10 or more times the upper limit of normal or rhabdomyolysis in the fluvastatin group. Fluvastatin treatment in patients with average cholesterol levels undergoing their first successful PCI significantly reduces the risk of major adverse cardiac events.",The Lescol Intervention Prevention study randomized patients after angioplasty to fluvastatin 40 mg twice daily or placebo.

One hundred two patients with mild to moderate facial acne vulgaris completed a 12-week, investigator-masked, randomized, parallel-group comparison of a gel formation of erythromycin (2%) with clindamycin phosphate 1% solution. Patients were evaluated at a baseline visit and after 4, 8, and 12 weeks of twice-daily treatment. Both medications significantly reduced the numbers of papules and open and closed comedones. No significant differences in lesion count reductions were detected between the treatment groups after 8 and 12 weeks of treatment. By the end of 12 weeks, 48% of the patients in the erythromycin group and 47% in the clindamycin group had good or excellent responses to treatment. No patient was terminated from the study for side effects. Most patients, 65% in the erythromycin 2% gel group and 67% in the clindamycin phosphate 1% solution group, had a favorable impression of the overall cosmetic characteristics of their study medication.",Both 1% clindamycin and 2% erythromycin were comparable in reducing inflammatory and noninflammatory lesions for patients with moderate acne.
"How do we evaluate a marginally low B12 level
To examine the relationship between the two diagnostic tests, plasma methylmalonic acid and plasma cobalamins, and their association with plasma creatinine, age and sex. Cross-sectional study of simultaneous laboratory measurements. County of Aarhus, Denmark. Records on 1689 patients who had their first plasma methylmalonic acid measurement during 1995 and 1996, and who had a simultaneous measurement of plasma cobalamins. Plasma creatinine values measured within a week of measurements of plasma methylmalonic acid and plasma cobalamins were available for 1255 of the patients. Predictors of variation in plasma methylmalonic acid; plasma cobalamins, plasma creatinine, age and sex. Plasma methylmalonic acid was positively correlated with plasma creatinine, even for plasma creatinine within the normal range. These associations remained in a multiple regression analysis. For plasma cobalamins below 200 pmol L-1, there was a strong negative correlation between plasma methylmalonic acid and plasma cobalamins, whilst the association was weak for higher plasma cobalamin levels. Plasma methylmalonic acid increased and plasma cobalamins decreased with age. The strong correlation between plasma methylmalonic acid and plasma creatinine suggests that plasma creatinine - also within the normal range - must be taken into consideration when interpreting plasma methylmalonic acid.","Vitamin B12 is a necessary coenzyme in the metabolism of methylmalonic acid to succinyl choline, and is also a necessary coenzyme with folate in the metabolism of homocysteine to methionine. Therefore, a vitamin B12 deficiency leads to elevated levels of unmetabolized methylmalonic acid and homocysteine. At a local lab the normal range of methylmalonic acid is 0.00 to 0.40 umol/L, and homocysteine's normal range is 4.0 to 10.0 mmol/L. Normal levels might vary by laboratory. Other conditions, such as renal insufficiency, may also cause elevation of methylmalonic acid and homocysteine."

Using an evidence-based technique, systematically review the literature to evaluate the accuracy of routine clinical history and physical examination in the diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) in the pediatric patient. The biomedical literature was systematically reviewed. Articles comparing the results of clinical evaluation to polysomnography (PSG) were selected. The level of evidence was assessed using established evidence-based medicine (EBM) guidelines. Twelve articles were identified using the search criteria. Eleven of 12 articles concluded that clinical evaluation is inaccurate in the diagnosis of OSAHS. The level of evidence was good to very good (Grade B/B+). Clinical history and physical examination are not reliable for diagnosing OSAHS compared with overnight PSG. Complicating the interpretation of this work is the lack of a validated PSG threshold of clinically significant disease. There is an urgent need for the development of adequate screening tests with validated clinical outcomes. B-3.","A systematic review of 12 studies including 1058 children under age 18 compared evaluation by polysomnography with clinical evaluation by history and physical examination alone. Clinical evaluation had a positive predictive value (PPV) of 55.8% (95% CI, 42.1%-69.6%); no single component demonstrated sensitivity and specificity more than 65%."
"What medications are effective for treating symptoms of premenstrual syndrome PMS
To determine the effectiveness of oral micronized progesterone, alprazolam, and placebo in premenstrual syndrome (PMS) treatment and the effect of clinical contact on treatment responses. Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 3-month parallel treatment arms with flexible dosage and with the length of clinical contact randomized within each treatment group. University hospital PMS medical treatment outpatient program in obstetrics/gynecology department. Among volunteers for PMS treatment, 444 were evaluated and 185 meeting defined PMS criteria were randomized to treatment; treatment data are available for 170. There were no medical withdrawals for adverse events. A double-blinded protocol in which 300 mg of oral micronized progesterone, 0.25 mg of alprazolam, or placebo was administered four times a day from day 18 of the menstrual cycle through day 2 of the next cycle, including taper. The mean daily dose at the third treatment was 1760 mg of progesterone or 1.5 mg of alprazolam. Subjects were randomized to brief (< 20 minutes) or extended (50 minutes) visits. Daily symptom report (DSR) scored for total DSR symptoms, four DSR factors. Alprazolam was significantly better than placebo or progesterone for total premenstrual symptoms and DSR factors of mental function, pain, and mood. Thirty-seven percent of the alprazolam group experienced a 50% reduction in total DSR scores. There were no clinically significant withdrawal symptoms when alprazolam administration was restricted to the luteal phase. Oral micronized progesterone therapy was no better than placebo. Brief vs extended visits had no effect on treatment outcome. Treatment response was associated with severity of premenstrual symptoms at baseline but with no other diagnostic variables. Alprazolam has a role in PMS treatment and offers a therapy limited to the luteal phase. Oral micronized progesterone is ineffective for PMS.","Benzodiazepines have shown mixed results in treating PMS, and overall their benefit appears smaller than that of SSRIs."
"What is appropriate management of iron deficiency for young children
Two groups of infants, one fed whole cow milk commencing at 6 months of age (n = 69) and the other continuing to receive iron-fortified infant formula (n = 98), were closely observed over their second 6 months of life. At 12 months of age, infants fed cow milk had significantly lower mean serum ferritin levels and mean corpuscular volume, higher free erythrocyte protoporphyrin values, and greater incidence of hemoglobin values less than 11 g/dl than did formula-fed infants. There were no significant differences in frequency of otitis media, wheezing episodes, nasal discharge or congestion, diaper dermatitis, constipation, guaiac-positive stools, or hospital admissions between the two groups. These data suggest that, to avoid iron deficiency, infants should continue to receive iron-fortified formula throughout the first year of life or a daily iron supplement if they are fed whole cow milk before their first birthday.","In a cohort study, infants given iron-fortified formula (n=98) were less likely to become iron-deficient by their 12-month visit than infants fed whole cow milk (n=69) (11.2% vs 24.6%, number needed to treat [NNT]=8)."
"When should COX-2 selective NSAIDs be used for osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis
We assessed the risk of ulcers with low-dose aspirin and the interaction of low-dose aspirin with a COX-2 selective inhibitor in a double-blind trial that compared placebo, low-dose aspirin, rofecoxib + low-dose aspirin, and ibuprofen. Osteoarthritis patients > or =50 years of age without ulcers or erosive esophagitis at baseline endoscopy were assigned randomly to placebo, enteric-coated aspirin 81 mg/day, rofecoxib 25 mg combined with aspirin 81 mg/day, or ibuprofen 800 mg 3 times a day. Repeat endoscopies were performed at 6 and 12 weeks. The 12-week cumulative incidence of ulcers was placebo (N = 381) 5.8%, aspirin (N = 387) 7.3%, rofecoxib combined with aspirin (N = 377) 16.1%, and ibuprofen (N = 374) 17.1% (P < 0.001 for rofecoxib combined with aspirin and for ibuprofen vs. each of placebo and aspirin). Over 12 weeks, mean increases in the number of erosions were placebo 0.17, aspirin 0.85 (P = 0.002 vs. placebo), rofecoxib combined with aspirin 1.67, and ibuprofen 1.91 (both P < 0.001 vs. aspirin and placebo). Low-dose aspirin alone did not significantly increase ulcer incidence. Addition of a cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) selective inhibitor to low-dose aspirin increased ulcer incidence, to a rate not significantly less than a nonselective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) alone. Determining the relative impact of COX-2 selective inhibitors and nonselective NSAIDs on gastrointestinal mucosal injury in low-dose aspirin users will require further study.","A recent double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled trial found that 12 weeks of treatment with a combination of low-dose aspirin and a COX-2 selective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (rofecoxib) had more than twice the incidence of endoscopically confirmed gastric and duodenal ulcers, compared with aspirin alone, and no difference with a nonselective NSAID. This has raised the safety concern of concomitant use of a COX-2 selective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs with low-dose aspirin."
"How much does smoking cessation cut coronary heart disease risk
The goal of this study was to determine the influence of smoking cessation on mortality after coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG), which has still not been established clearly. Cigarette smoking is one of the known major risk factors of coronary artery disease. One thousand and forty-one patients underwent CABG between 1971 and 1980. The preoperative and postoperative smoking habits of 985 patients (95%) could be retrieved and were analyzed in a multivariate Cox analysis. The median follow-up was 20 years (range 13 to 26 years). Smoking status before surgery did not entail an increased risk of mortality: patients who had smoked before surgery and those who had not smoked in the year before surgery had a similar probability of survival. However, smoking cessation after surgery was an important independent predictor of a lower risk of death and coronary reintervention during the 20-year follow-up when compared with patients who continued smoking. In analyses adjusted for baseline characteristics, the persistent smokers had a greater relative risk (RR) of death from all causes (RR 1.68 [95% confidence interval 1.33 to 2.13]) and cardiac death (RR 1.75 [1.30 to 2.37]) as compared with patients who stopped smoking for at least one year after surgery. The estimated benefit of survival for the quitters increased from 3% at five years to 14% at 15 years. The quitters were less likely to undergo repeat CABG or a percutaneous coronary angioplasty procedure (RR 1.41 [1.02 to 1.94]). Patients who continued to smoke after CABG had a greater risk of death than patients who stopped smoking. They also underwent repeat revascularization procedures more frequently. Cessation of smoking is therefore strongly recommended after CABG. Clinicians are encouraged to start or to continue smoking-cessation programs in order to help smokers to quit smoking, especially after CABG.","A study found similar results at 20-year follow-up: Patients who had quit smoking underwent fewer repeat CABGs than smokers (RR=1.41; 95% CI, 1.02-1.94).8 The difference between post-CABG survival curves for quitters versus smokers increased from 3% at 5 years (98% vs 95%) to 15% at 15 years (70% vs 55%; P<.0001; NNT=6.7)."
"Do insulin-sensitizing drugs increase ovulation rates for women with PCOS
In women suffering from polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), correction of hyperinsulinemia results enhances spontaneous ovulation or alternatively, the responsiveness to ovulation induction agents such as clomiphene citrate (CC). We investigated the effect of rosiglitazone maleate on ovulation induction in overweight and obese, CC-resistant women with PCOS. Double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. Academic reproductive endocrinology clinic. Overweight and obese women with clinical and laboratory manifestations of PCOS who desired pregnancy and were resistant to CC. Twenty-five women were randomized into two treatment groups. Subjects in Group I (n = 12) were randomized to receive rosiglitazone 4 mg b.i.d. with a placebo on cycle days 5-9. Group II (n = 13) was randomized to receive rosiglitazone 4 mg b.i.d. with CC on cycle days 5-9. The duration of the study was 2 months. The primary outcome was ovulation as defined by luteal serum progesterone greater than 5 ng/dL assessed on days 21, 24, and 28 of the cycle. Secondary outcomes were pregnancy and changes in insulin sensitivity, serum lipoproteins, and androgens. Overall, 14 of 25 (56%) women, who were previously resistant to CC, successfully ovulated. In subjects taking rosiglitazone alone (Group I), 4 of 12 (33%) subjects ovulated compared with 10 of 13 (77%) women randomized to rosiglitazone with CC (Group II) (P=.04, Fisher's exact). One subject in Group I became pregnant, resulting in one uncomplicated live birth; two subjects in Group II conceived, with one successful live birth and one first trimester, spontaneous abortion. For all subjects, fasting insulin declined from 29.4 +/- 13.8 microU/mL to 17.3 +/- 7.8 microU/mL after rosiglitazone (P=.003, paired t-test). Although mean levels of total testosterone (T) and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) did not decline significantly, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) did increase from 0.7 +/- 0.3 microg/dL to 1.0 +/- 0.3 microg/dL after rosiglitazone therapy (P=.001, paired t test). There was also a decrease in luteinizing hormone (LH) from 9.4 +/- 6.3 mU/mL to 7.2 +/- 3.7 mU/mL (P=.01). Lipoproteins including total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and triglycerides did not change. Short-term rosiglitazone therapy enhances both spontaneous and clomiphene-induced ovulation in overweight and obese women with PCOS. Rosiglitazone therapy improves insulin sensitivity and decreases hyperandrogenemia primarily through increases in SHBG.","A small randomized controlled trials which studied the use of rosiglitazone (Avandia) in combination with clomiphene reported both spontaneous and clomiphene-induced ovulation rates (52% of clomiphene-resistant women ovulated after rosiglitazone therapy and 77% vs 33% ovulated with combination therapy vs rosiglitazone alone, P=.04)."
"What is the best hypnotic for use in the elderly
To systematically review the benefits and risks associated with the use of benzodiazepines to treat insomnia in adults. MEDLINE and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Registry were searched for English-language articles published from 1966 to December 1998 that described randomized controlled trials of benzodiazepines for the treatment of insomnia. Key words included ""benzodiazepines"" (exploded), ""randomized controlled trial"" and ""insomnia."" Bibliographies of relevant articles were reviewed for additional studies and manufacturers of benzodiazepines were asked to submit additional randomized controlled trial reports not in the literature. Articles were considered for the meta-analysis if they were randomized controlled trials involving patients with insomnia and compared a benzodiazepine with placebo or another active agent. Of the 89 trials originally identified, 45 met our criteria, representing a total of 2672 patients. Data were extracted regarding the participants, the setting, details of the intervention, the outcomes (including adverse effects) and the methodologic quality of the studies. The meta-analyses of sleep records indicated that, when compared with placebo, benzodiazepines decreased sleep latency by 4.2 minutes (non-significant; 95% confidence interval (CI -0.7 to 9.2) and significantly increased total sleep duration by 61.8 minutes (95% CI 37.4 to 86.2). Patient-reported outcomes were more optimistic for sleep latency; those randomized to benzodiazepine treatment estimated a sleep latency decrease of 14.3 minutes (95% CI 10.6 to 18.0). Although more patients receiving benzodiazepine treatment reported adverse effects, especially daytime drowsiness and dizziness or light-headedness (common odds ratio 1.8, 95% CI 1.4 to 2.4), dropout rates for the benzodiazepine and placebo groups were similar. Cognitive function decline including memory impairment was reported in several of the studies. Zopiclone was not found to be superior to benzodiazepines on any of the outcome measures examined. The use of benzodiazepines in the treatment of insomnia is associated with an increase in sleep duration, but this is countered by a number of adverse effects. Additional studies evaluating the efficacy of nonpharmacological interventions would be valuable.","Benzodiazepines have been used since the 1960s for their hypnotic, anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, muscle-relaxing, and amnesic properties. A recent meta-analysis showed that benzodiazepines improve sleep latency by only 4.2 minutes compared with placebo."
"What treatments are effective for varicose veins
The study was planned to evaluate efficacy and costs of endovascular sclerotherapy (ES) in comparison with surgery and surgery associated with sclerotherapy in a prospective (10-year follow-up), good-clinical-practice study. Patients with varicose veins and pure, superficial venous incompetence were included. Of the patients randomized into the three groups 39 (group A) were treated with ES, 40 (B) with surgery + sclerotherapy, and 42 with surgery only (C). Surgery consisted of ligation of the SFJ (saphenofemoral junction) and of incompetent veins detected with color duplex. Of the preselected 150 patients, 121 subjects entered the study; 96 completed the 10-year follow-up (mean age 52.6 +/- 6 years; 51 men, 45 women). Dropouts were due to nonmedical problems. At 10 years no incompetence was observed in subjects treated with SPJ ligation (B and C). In the ES group 18.8% of the SFJs were patent and incompetent and in 43.8% of limbs the distal (below-knee) venous system was still incompetent [16.1% in the surgery + sclerotherapy group (p < 0.05) and 36% in the group treated with surgery only (p < 0.05 vs B and 0.05 vs A)]. Color duplex of the long saphenous vein indicated atrophy or obstruction of a segment (average 6.7 cm) after SFJ ligation (4.2 cm after ES). The cost of ES was 68% of surgery while the cost of surgery and sclerotherapy was 122% of surgery only. Endovascular sclerotherapy is an effective, cheaper treatment option, but surgery after 10 years is superior.","Belcaro reported results of a 10-year randomized trial including 121 subjects, 96 of whom completed the study. Surgery consisted of ligation of the saphenopopliteal junction without stripping. At 10 years, 16.1% of patients receiving surgery plus sclerotherapy had distal venous incompetence (assessed with color duplex scanning and ambulatory venous pressure measurement), compared with 36.4% of those who underwent surgery alone and 43.8% of those who received sclerotherapy alone. The authors concluded that long-term outcomes (defined as saphenofemoral junction competence) are superior with strategies that included surgery, but at greater cost."
"Heat or ice for acute ankle sprain
Cooling treatment with 'Cryogel' is compared with the use of crepe bandaging in patients with recent ankle sprains. All patients were followed up regularly and the results appears to favour cooling when it is used in the early period of treatment. Cooling reduced oedema, pain and disability, and shortened the recovery period.","A randomized controlled trial compared ice with placebo in 30 patients with grade 3 and 4 sprains referred to a physiotherapy department within 2 days of ankle injury. No statistical difference was found in recovery time, defined as ability to bear weight with only mild to moderate pain."
"What steps can reduce morbidity and mortality caused by hip fractures
Untreated pain is a major health care issue and very little is known about the treatment of pain and the effect of pain on post-operative outcomes in older adults. This study was performed to identify the impact of pain on outcomes following hip fracture in older adults. Four hundred and eleven consecutive cognitively intact patients admitted with hip fracture to four New York hospitals were enrolled in a prospective cohort study. Patients were interviewed daily using standardized pain assessments. We used multiple logistic regression and ordinary least squares linear regression to examine the association of post-operative pain on immediate post-operative outcomes (duration of stay, physical therapy sessions missed or shortened, ambulation following surgery, and post-operative complications) and outcomes 6 months following fracture (locomotion, mortality, return to the community, residual pain). Patients with higher pain scores at rest had significantly longer hospital lengths of stay (P=0.03), were significantly more likely to have physical therapy sessions missed or shortened (P=0.002), were significantly less likely to be ambulating by post-operative day 3 (P<0.001), took significantly longer to ambulate past a bedside chair (P=0.01), and had significantly lower locomotion scores at 6 months (P=0.02). Pain at rest was not significantly associated with post-operative complications, nursing home placement, survival at 6 months, or residual pain at 6 months. Post-operative pain is associated with increased hospital length of stay, delayed ambulation, and long-term functional impairment. Whereas appropriate caution is warranted in administering opioid analgesics to older adults, these data suggest that improved pain control may decrease length of stay, enhance functional recovery, and improve long-term functional outcomes.","In a 2003 prospective cohort study, patients without sufficient analgesia had an increased risk of poor functional recovery and longer hospitalization."
"What is the best hypnotic for use in the elderly
Insomnia affects 30-35% of people living in developed countries. The impact of insomnia on daytime functioning and its relationship with medical and psychiatric illnesses necessitate early treatment to prevent insomnia becoming persistent and to avoid the development of complications. However, pharmacological strategies must achieve a balance between sedative and adverse effects. In the last 30 years, benzodiazepines have been the preferred drugs for the treatment of insomnia. Benzodiazepines act nonselectively at two central receptor sites, named omega(1) and omega(2), which are located in different areas of the CNS. The sedative action of benzodiazepines is related to omega(1) receptors, whereas omega(2) receptors are responsible for their effects on memory and cognitive functioning. According to their pharmacokinetic profile, benzodiazepines can be classified into three groups: short half-life (<3 hours), medium half-life (8-24 hours) and long half-life (>24 hours). The newer non-benzodiazepine agents zopiclone, zolpidem and zaleplon have a hypnosedative action comparable with that of benzodiazepines, but they display specific pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. These three 'Z' agents all share a short plasma half-life and limited duration of action. In addition, these agents are selective compounds that interact preferentially with omega(1) receptors (sedative effect), whereas benzodiazepines also interact with omega(2) receptors (adverse effects on cognitive performance and memory). Zaleplon is characterised by an ultrashort half-life (approximately 1 hour). Zolpidem and zopiclone have longer half-lives (approximately 2.4 and 5 hours, respectively). These properties, together with the low risk of residual effect, may explain the limited negative influences of these agents on daytime performance. Psychomotor tasks and memory capacities appear to be better preserved by non-benzodiazepine agents than by benzodiazepines. When present, cognitive deficits almost exclusively coincide with the peak plasma concentration. In particular, impairment can emerge in the first hours after drug administration, whereas psychomotor and memory tests carried out 7-8 hours later (i.e. in the morning) generally show no relevant alterations. As with benzodiazepines, the three 'Z' non-benzodiazepine agents should be used for a limited period, even in chronic relapsing conditions. Further evaluation is needed of the safety of hypnosedative medications in the long-term management of insomnia.","Tolerance, withdrawal symptoms, or rebound insomnia occur less frequently than with benzodi-azepines."
"What are effective medical treatments for adults with acute migraine
To compare the safety and efficacy of isometheptene mucate, dichloralphenazone with acetaminophen to sumatriptan succinate for the treatment of mild-to-moderate migraine, with or without aura, when taken at the first sign of an attack. The Food and Drug Administration approved sumatriptan succinate and the combination of isometheptene mucate, dichloralphenazone with acetaminophen for the treatment of migraine. As part of the stratified treatment of migraine, those patients whose headaches are mild or moderate may benefit from nontriptan medications. Additionally, early treatment of acute migraine before the headache has become moderate or severe may improve response to treatment. This was a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group study to assess the safety and efficacy of the combination of isometheptene mucate, dichloralphenazone with acetaminophen and sumatriptan succinate in the early stages of a single migraine attack. Patients diagnosed with migraine, with or without aura, as defined by the International Headache Society diagnostic criteria were enrolled. One hundred thirty-seven patients were enrolled in the study. Data for efficacy were available for 126 patients; safety data were available for 128 patients. No statistically significant difference between the two active agents in the patient's response to treatment was demonstrated. Headache recurrence was not significantly different over the 24-hour evaluation period for those patients responding in the first 4 hours. In those with headache recurrence, it was statistically significantly more severe in those patients treated with sumatriptan succinate. Improvement in functional disability was, in general, better among those treated with isometheptene mucate, dichloralphenazone with acetaminophen. Global analysis of efficacy was similar in the two active groups. Patients treated with sumatriptan succinate were somewhat more likely to have adverse effects than the isometheptene mucate, dichloralphenazone with acetaminophen group. Both isometheptene mucate, dichloralphenazone with acetaminophen and sumatriptan succinate are safe and effective when used early in the treatment of an acute migraine. Several parameters suggest that isometheptene mucate, dichloralphenazone with acetaminophen may have a slight advantage compared with sumatriptan succinate in the early treatment of mild-to-moderate migraine.","A multicenter, double-blind, randomized parallel group study showed no difference between the combination product isometheptene mucate, dichloralphenazone with acetaminophen (Midrin, Duradrin, etc) (used as recommended in the package insert with a maximum of up to 5 tablets within 24 hours) vs oral sumatriptan (initial dose of 25 mg with a repeat 25 mg dose in 2 hours). No placebo arm was used in this study."
"Which diuretics are safe and effective for patients with a sulfa allergy
The safety of sulfonamide nonantibiotics is unclear in patients with prior allergic reactions to sulfonamide antibiotics. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the General Practice Research Database in the United Kingdom, examining the risk of allergic reactions within 30 days after the receipt of a sulfonamide nonantibiotic. Patients with evidence of prior hypersensitivity after the receipt of a sulfonamide antibiotic were compared with those without such evidence. Similar analyses were also performed with the use of penicillins instead of sulfonamides, to determine whether any risk was specific to sulfonamide cross-reactivity. Of 969 patients with an allergic reaction after a sulfonamide antibiotic, 96 (9.9 percent) had an allergic reaction after subsequently receiving a sulfonamide nonantibiotic. Of 19,257 who had no allergic reaction after a sulfonamide antibiotic, 315 (1.6 percent) had an allergic reaction after receiving a sulfonamide nonantibiotic (adjusted odds ratio, 2.8; 95 percent confidence interval, 2.1 to 3.7). However, the risk of allergic reactions was even greater after the receipt of a penicillin among patients with a prior hypersensitivity reaction to a sulfonamide antibiotic, as compared with patients with no such history (adjusted odds ratio, 3.9; 95 percent confidence interval, 3.5 to 4.3). Furthermore, among those with a prior hypersensitivity reaction after the receipt of a sulfonamide antibiotic, the risk of an allergic reaction after the subsequent receipt of a sulfonamide nonantibiotic was lower than the risk of an allergic reaction after the subsequent receipt of a penicillin (adjusted odds ratio, 0.7; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.5 to 0.9). Finally, the risk of an allergic reaction after the receipt of a sulfonamide nonantibiotic was lower among patients with a history of hypersensitivity to sulfonamide antibiotics than among patients with a history of hypersensitivity to penicillins (adjusted odds ratio, 0.6; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.5 to 0.8). There is an association between hypersensitivity after the receipt of sulfonamide antibiotics and a subsequent allergic reaction after the receipt of a sulfonamide nonantibiotic, but this association appears to be due to a predisposition to allergic reactions rather than to cross-reactivity with sulfonamide-based drugs.","A large retrospective cohort study using Britain's General Practice Research Database identified 20,226 patients seen from 1987 through March 1999 who were prescribed a systemic sulfonamide antibiotic, and then at least 60 days later received a nonantibiotic sulfonamide (eg, thiazide diuretic, furosemide, oral hypoglycemic). Researchers reviewed records to determine whether patients described as having an allergic reaction to a sulfonamide antibiotic were at increased risk of having a subsequent allergic reaction to a sulfonamide nonantibiotic. researchers identified allergies to sulfonamide antibiotics in 969 patients. Of this group, 96 patients (9.9%) had a subsequent reaction to a sulfonamide nonantibiotic, which included drugs from the loop and thiazide diuretic classes (including bumetanide, chlorothiazide, furosemide, hydrochlorothiazide, indapamide, and torsemide). It was unclear if any patients taking a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor experienced an allergic reaction. For comparison purposes, of the 19,257 patients who were not identified as having an allergy to a sulfonamide antibiotic, again using the broad definition, 315 (1.6%), had a subsequent allergic reaction to a sulfonamide nonantibiotic, for an unadjusted odds ratio of 6.6 (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.2-8.4). When the results were adjusted for age, sex, history of asthma, use of medications for asthma or corticosteroids, the adjusted odds ratio for individuals experiencing an allergy to a nonantibiotic sulfonamide in those persons with a history of allergy to a sulfonamide antibiotic was 2.8 (95 % CI, 2.1-3.7). Of note, the adjusted odds ratio for the occurrence of a penicillin allergy in a patient with a history of sulfonamide antibiotic allergy was significantly higher at 3.9 (95% CI, 3.5-4.3)"
"What physical exam techniques are useful to detect malingering
This is a structured, evidence-based review of all available studies addressing the concept of nonorganic findings: Waddell signs (WSs). To determine what evidence, if any, exists for the various interpretations for the presence of WSs on physical examination. WSs are a group of eight physical findings divided into five categories, the presence of which has been alleged at times to have the following interpretations: Malingering/secondary gain, hysteria, psychological distress, magnified presentation, abnormal illness behavior, abnormal pain behavior, and somatic amplification. At the present time, there is, therefore, significant confusion as to what these findings mean. A computer and manual literature search produced 61 studies and case series reports relating to WSs. These references were reviewed in detail, sorted, and placed into tabular form according to the following subject areas: 1) Reliability (test-retest); 2) Reliability (inter-rater); 3) Reliability (factor analysis); 4) Validity, psychological distress; 5) Validity, correlation Minnesota Multiphasic Pain Inventory (MMPI); 6) Validity, correlation abnormal illness behavior; 7) Validity, other behaviors; 8) Validity, as a nonorganic phenomenon; 9) Validity, correlation pain drawing; 10) Validity, functional performance; 11) Validity, treatment outcome; 12) Validity, predicting surgical treatment outcome; 13) Validity, return to work outcome; 14) Validity, secondary gain correlation; and 15) Validity, pain correlation. Each study in each topic area was classified according to the type of study it represented according to the type of evidence guidelines developed by the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR). In addition, a list of 14 study quality criteria was used to measure the quality of each study. Each study was categorized for each criterion as positive, (criterion filled), negative (criterion not filled), or not applicable independently by two of the authors. A percent quality score was obtained for each study by counting the total number of positives obtained, dividing by 14 minus the total number of not applicables, and multiplying by 100. Only studies having a quality score of 75% or greater were used to formulate the conclusions of this review. The strength and consistency of the evidence represented by the remaining studies in each topic area (above) was then categorized according to the strength and consistency AHCPR guidelines. Conclusions of this review for each topic area are based on these results. Of the 61 studies, four had quality scores below 75% and were not used to generate the results of this review. According to the AHCPR guidelines for strength and consistency of the reviewed data, the following results were obtained: 1) There was consistent evidence for WSs being associated with decreased functional performance, poor nonsurgical treatment outcome, and greater levels of pain; 2) There was generally consistent evidence for WSs not being associated with psychological distress, abnormal illness behavior, or secondary gain; 3) There was also generally consistent evidence that WSs are an organic phenomenon and that they cannot be used to discriminate organic from nonorganic problems; 4) There was inconsistent evidence that WSs do demonstrate inter-rater reliability, do not correlate with the neurotic triad of the MMPI, are associated with poorer surgical treatment outcome, and are associated with nonreturn to work; 5) There was little or no evidence that WSs demonstrate test-retest reliability, or reliable factors, and are associated with self-esteem problems, catastrophizing, or the nonorganic pain drawing. Based on the above results, the following conclusions were made: 1) WSs do not correlate with psychological distress; 2) WSs do not discriminate organic from nonorganic problems; 3) WSs may represent an organic phenomenon; 4) WSs are associated with poorer treatment outcome; 5) WSs are associated with greater pain levels; 6) WSs are not associated with secondary gain; and 7) As a group, WS studies demonstrate some methodological problems.","A systematic review critiqued 60 studies of Waddell's signs published between 1980 and 2000. The authors performed a thorough database search, including hand searches of key pain journals, meeting abstracts, and textbooks. The majority of the reviewed studies were small and of lower quality. The review found little evidence on test-retest or interrater reliability. There was consistent evidence that Waddell's signs are associated with poorer treatment outcomes and generally consistent evidence that they are not associated with secondary gain and cannot discriminate organic from nonorganic problems."
"What is the best initial treatment for orbital cellulitis in children
Preseptal and orbital cellulitis range in severity from minor to potentially severe complications. The purpose of this study is to describe the clinical features of patients with preseptal or orbital cellulitis in one medical center in Taiwan, and to assess the effectiveness of treatments and the complications. Patients admitted between 1996 and 2005 to Taipei Veterans General Hospital under the diagnosis of preseptal or orbital cellulitis were retrospectively reviewed. The demographics, administrative history, past history, clinical presentations, treatments, and complications were analyzed. In total, 94 patients fulfilling the diagnostic criteria for preseptal or orbital cellulitis were identified (67 had preseptal cellulitis, 27 had orbital cellulitis). While paranasal sinus disease was the most common predisposing cause in orbital cases, skin lesions in children and dacryocystitis in adults were the most common in preseptal cases. Microbiologic investigations showed variable results, but the most common pathogen isolated was Staphylococcus aureus. Cultures from eye swabs and local abscesses gave the highest positive yield. Blood cultures were taken in some patients, but the positive rate was extremely low. Treatments included intravenous antibiotics alone, or intravenous antibiotics combined with surgical drainage. Only one case had permanent ocular motility impairment after removal of the orbital foreign body. Despite the past history of potential morbidity and even mortality from orbital cellulitis, early diagnosis and prompt treatment with proper antibiotics and/or surgical intervention can achieve a good prognosis.",A retrospective case series of 94 patients of all ages in China implicated Staphylococcus aureus and streptococcal species based on cultures taken from eye purulence and abscesses.
"What is the best treatment for gastroesophageal reflux and vomiting in infants
To determine the prevalence of symptoms associated with overt gastroesophageal reflux (GER) during the first year of life, to describe when most infants outgrow these symptoms, and to assess the prevalence of parental reports of various symptoms associated with GER and the percentages of infants who have been treated for GER. Cross-sectional survey. Nineteen Pediatric Practice Research Group practices in the Chicago, Ill, area (urban, suburban, and semirural). A total of 948 parents of healthy children 13 months old and younger. None. Reported frequency of regurgitation. Regurgitation of at least 1 episode a day was reported in half of 0- to 3-month-olds. This symptom decreased to 5% at 10 to 12 months of age (P < .001). Peak reported regurgitation was 67% at 4 months; the prevalence of symptoms decreased dramatically from 61% to 21% between 6 and 7 months of age. Infants with at least 4 episodes daily of regurgitation showed a similar pattern (P < .001). Peak regurgitation reported as a ""problem"" was most often seen at 6 months (23%); this prevalence decreased to 14% at 7 months of age. Parental perception that regurgitation was a problem was associated with the frequency and volume of regurgitation, increased crying or fussiness, reported discomfort with spitting up, and frequent back arching. Reported treatment for regurgitation included a change in formula in 8.1%, thickened feedings in 2.2%, termination of breast-feeding in 1.1%, and medication in 0.2%. Complaints of regurgitation are common during the first year of life, peaking at 4 months of age. Many infants ""outgrow"" overt GER by 7 months and most by 1 year. Parents view this symptom as a problem more often than medical intervention is given.","In a cross-sectional survey of 948 parents of healthy infants aged 0 to 13 months, regurgitation occurred daily in half of infants from birth to 3 months old, peaked to 67% at age 4 months, and was absent in 95% by age 12 months."
"Which oral antifungal is best for toenail onychomycosis
Onychomycosis is a common nail disease that is often chronic, difficult to eradicate, and has a tendency to recur. The most common oral therapies for dermatophyte toenail onychomycosis include terbinafine, itraconazole and fluconazole. A cumulative meta-analysis of the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for antimycotic agents was performed to determine whether the pooled estimate of the cure rates has remained consistent over the years. Furthermore, for each agent we compared the overall meta-analytical average of both mycological and clinical response rates of RCTs vs. open studies. We searched MEDLINE (1966 to November 2002) for relevant studies evaluating the efficacy of the oral antifungal agents terbinafine, itraconazole (pulse or continuous), fluconazole and griseofulvin for treating dermatophyte toenail onychomycosis. Studies included in this meta-analysis required a standard accepted dosage regimen, treatment duration and follow-up period. To determine the cumulative meta-analytical average, studies were sequentially pooled by adding one study at a time according to the date of publication (i.e. earliest to the most recent). There were 36 studies included in the analyses. For RCTs the change in efficacy of mycological cure rates from the first trial to the overall cumulative meta-average for each drug comparator is as follows (with 95% confidence interval): terbinafine, 78 +/- 6% (n = 2 studies, 79 patients) to 76 +/- 3% (n = 18 studies, 993 patients) (P = 0.68); itraconazole pulse, 75 +/- 10% (n = 1 study, 20 patients) to 63 +/- 7% (n = 6 studies, 318 patients) (P = 0.25); itraconazole continuous, 63 +/- 5% (n = 1 study, 84 patients) to 59 +/- 5% (n = 7 studies, 1131 patients) (P = 0.47); fluconazole, 53 +/- 6% (n = 1 study, 72 patients) to 48 +/- 5% (n = 3 studies, 131 patients) (P = 0.50); and griseofulvin, 55 +/- 8% (n = 2 studies, 109 patients) to 60 +/- 6% (n = 3 studies, 167 patients) (P = 0.41). The cumulative meta-analytical average of mycological cure rates when comparing RCTs vs. open studies was: terbinafine, 76 +/- 3% (n = 18 studies, 993 patients) vs. 83 +/- 12% (n = 2 studies, 391 patients) (P = 0.0028); itraconazole pulse, 63 +/- 7% (n = 6 studies, 318 patients) vs. 84 +/- 9% (n = 3 studies, 194 patients) (P = 0.0001); and fluconazole, 48 +/- 5% (n = 3 studies, 131 patients) vs. 79 +/- 3% (n = 3 studies, 208 patients) (P = 0.0001). The cumulative meta-analysis of cure rates for RCTs suggests that over time, as new RCTs have been conducted, the efficacy rates have remained consistent. The efficacy rates of open studies are substantially higher compared with RCTs and may therefore overestimate cure rates.","A meta-analysis comparing the efficacy of terbinafine (Lamisil), pulse-dosed and continuous-dosed itraconazole (Sporanox), fluconazole (Diflucan), and griseofulvin showed mycological cure rates of varying degrees for each treatment."
"What is the best macrolide for atypical pneumonia
The efficacy and safety of orally administered clarithromycin and erythromycin in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia were assessed in a multicenter, double-blind, randomized study. Two hundred sixty-eight patients were randomized to receive either clarithromycin, 250 mg twice a day, or erythromycin stearate, 500 mg 4 times a day, for 7 to 14 days. Efficacy was evaluable in 173 patients (92 for clarithromycin, 81 for erythromycin). No statistically significant difference in clinical success rate (cure or improvement) was observed between the two groups (clarithromycin, 97 percent; erythromycin, 96 percent). Both groups had identical radiologic response (97 percent with resolution or improvement). Similarly, no statistically significant difference in bacteriologic response toward the target pathogens was observed among evaluable patients (clarithromycin, 23/26; erythromycin, 17/17; p value = 0.287). Clinical response toward Mycoplasma and Chlamydia pneumonia was comparable between the two groups (clarithromycin, 15/16; erythromycin, 10/11). However, patients receiving erythromycin had a twofold higher incidence of adverse events, mostly related to the gastrointestinal system, and were five times more likely to withdraw from therapy because of drug-related adverse events. These results show that clarithromycin is as effective as erythromycin in the outpatient treatment of community-acquired pneumonia. Furthermore, the lower incidence of adverse events associated with clarithromycin indicates that it is more acceptable to patients and, therefore, can enhance compliance.","A study compared antibiotics for patients with community acquired pneumonia aged 12 to 93 years. Subgroup analysis of those with M pneumoniae or C pneumoniae (n=27) showed similar efficacy. Pooling all 268 patients with CAP, side effects were seen in 31% of patients on clarithromycin and 59% on erythromycin (P<.001)."
"What is appropriate fetal surveillance for women with diet-controlled gestational diabetes
Our purpose was to evaluate an antepartum testing program based on twice-weekly nonstress testing and amniotic fluid evaluation in pregnancies complicated by diabetes mellitus and to weight the test components in the prediction of fetal distress requiring cesarean delivery. During the 4-year period of 1987 through 1990, 2134 women with pregnancies complicated by diabetes underwent antepartum testing. Of these 1501 women (class A1, n = 505; A2-diet, n = 305; A2-insulin, n = 580; B, n = 71; C to D, n = 29; R to F, n = 11) were delivered within 4 days of their last test. Categoric analysis of data was performed according to diabetic class, fetal heart rate results, and the presence of decreased, normal, or increased amniotic fluid assessment. A univariate logistical regression was first conducted with cesarean delivery for fetal distress as outcome variable by use of the following variables: fetal weight and sex, diabetic class, gestational age at delivery, presence of additional indications for antepartum testing, largest vertical pocket, amniotic fluid index (summation of the four quadrants of the largest vertical pocket), nonstress test reactivity (two accelerations of > or = 15 beats/min of 15 seconds' duration), presence of decelerations (> or = 15 beats/min for 15 seconds) during the nonstress test, and the interactions of the nonstress test with deceleration, largest vertical pocket, and amniotic fluid index. Multivariate analysis was then applied to predict the best model. No stillbirths occurred within 4 days of the last antepartum test. However, the corrected stillbirth rate of the entire tested population was 1.4 per 1000. Eighty-five women required cesarean delivery for fetal distress. The factors most predictive of cesarean delivery for fetal distress (p < 0.05, odds ratio and 95% confidence interval) were a deceleration (3.60, 2.14 to 6.06), nonreactive nonstress test (2.68, 1.60 to 4.49), and the interaction of both a nonreactive nonstress test and decelerations (5.63, 2.67 to 11.9). Amniotic fluid assessment by largest vertical pocket or amniotic fluid index were not statistically significant. The multivariate analysis selected the interaction of nonstress test and deceleration as the best significant predictor for cesarean delivery for fetal distress. An antepartum fetal surveillance program using twice-weekly nonstress test and fluid index assessment in pregnancies complicated by diabetes was successful in preventing stillbirth. The absence of fetal heart rate reactivity and the presence of decelerations were predictive of the diagnosis of fetal distress in labor requiring cesarean delivery. Ultrasonographic assessment of amniotic fluid volume was not a significant predictor of fetal distress in labor in the diabetic pregnancy.","One study evaluated antepartum predictors of fetal distress requiring a cesarean delivery among 2134 pregnant women with gestational diabetes. Antepartum surveillance consisted of biweekly nonstress testing with amniotic fluid index determination starting at 34 weeks gestation. Of the 1501 eligible participants, the study included 810 and 580 class A1 and A2 patients, respectively; the remaining 111 were classes B-T. They considered women with A1 gestational diabetes with fasting plasma glucose levels <105 mg/dL to be well-controlled. Results of antepartum surveillance did not significantly differ among the different diabetic classes."
"Do statins reduce the risk of stroke
Throughout the usual LDL cholesterol range in Western populations, lower blood concentrations are associated with lower cardiovascular disease risk. In such populations, therefore, reducing LDL cholesterol may reduce the development of vascular disease, largely irrespective of initial cholesterol concentrations. 20,536 UK adults (aged 40-80 years) with coronary disease, other occlusive arterial disease, or diabetes were randomly allocated to receive 40 mg simvastatin daily (average compliance: 85%) or matching placebo (average non-study statin use: 17%). Analyses are of the first occurrence of particular events, and compare all simvastatin-allocated versus all placebo-allocated participants. These ""intention-to-treat"" comparisons assess the effects of about two-thirds (85% minus 17%) taking a statin during the scheduled 5-year treatment period, which yielded an average difference in LDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L (about two-thirds of the effect of actual use of 40 mg simvastatin daily). Primary outcomes were mortality (for overall analyses) and fatal or non-fatal vascular events (for subcategory analyses), with subsidiary assessments of cancer and of other major morbidity. All-cause mortality was significantly reduced (1328 [12.9%] deaths among 10,269 allocated simvastatin versus 1507 [14.7%] among 10,267 allocated placebo; p=0.0003), due to a highly significant 18% (SE 5) proportional reduction in the coronary death rate (587 [5.7%] vs 707 [6.9%]; p=0.0005), a marginally significant reduction in other vascular deaths (194 [1.9%] vs 230 [2.2%]; p=0.07), and a non-significant reduction in non-vascular deaths (547 [5.3%] vs 570 [5.6%]; p=0.4). There were highly significant reductions of about one-quarter in the first event rate for non-fatal myocardial infarction or coronary death (898 [8.7%] vs 1212 [11.8%]; p<0.0001), for non-fatal or fatal stroke (444 [4.3%] vs 585 [5.7%]; p<0.0001), and for coronary or non-coronary revascularisation (939 [9.1%] vs 1205 [11.7%]; p<0.0001). For the first occurrence of any of these major vascular events, there was a definite 24% (SE 3; 95% CI 19-28) reduction in the event rate (2033 [19.8%] vs 2585 [25.2%] affected individuals; p<0.0001). During the first year the reduction in major vascular events was not significant, but subsequently it was highly significant during each separate year. The proportional reduction in the event rate was similar (and significant) in each subcategory of participant studied, including: those without diagnosed coronary disease who had cerebrovascular disease, or had peripheral artery disease, or had diabetes; men and, separately, women; those aged either under or over 70 years at entry; and--most notably--even those who presented with LDL cholesterol below 3.0 mmol/L (116 mg/dL), or total cholesterol below 5.0 mmol/L (193 mg/dL). The benefits of simvastatin were additional to those of other cardioprotective treatments. The annual excess risk of myopathy with this regimen was about 0.01%. There were no significant adverse effects on cancer incidence or on hospitalisation for any other non-vascular cause. Adding simvastatin to existing treatments safely produces substantial additional benefits for a wide range of high-risk patients, irrespective of their initial cholesterol concentrations. Allocation to 40 mg simvastatin daily reduced the rates of myocardial infarction, of stroke, and of revascularisation by about one-quarter. After making allowance for non-compliance, actual use of this regimen would probably reduce these rates by about one-third. Hence, among the many types of high-risk individual studied, 5 years of simvastatin would prevent about 70-100 people per 1000 from suffering at least one of these major vascular events (and longer treatment should produce further benefit). The size of the 5-year benefit depends chiefly on such individuals' overall risk of major vascular events, rather than on their blood lipid concentrations alone.",The Heart Protection Study showed no difference in the number of hemorrhagic strokes between treatment and placebo groups. There were 3500 subjects with pretreatment low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol <100 mg/dL; lowering low density lipoprotein to 65 mg/dL reduced major vascular event risk by about 25%.
"Do inhaled steroids increase the risk of osteoporosis
To evaluate the effects of treatment with fluticasone propionate vs placebo on bone, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis function, and the eyes in patients with asthma. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 160 patients with asthma who had minimal previous exposure to corticosteroids was conducted from July 1994 through June 1997. Patients received fluticasone at 88 microg twice daily, fluticasone at 440 microg twice daily, or placebo twice daily for 2 years. Bone mineral density (BMD) was evaluated every 6 months by lumbar spine, proximal femur, and total body scans. Measurements of HPA axis function and ophthalmic evaluations were conducted at similar intervals. Among the 3 groups, no significant differences were observed in BMD at week 104 (at any anatomical site). Mean percent change from baseline in the lumbar spine was less than 1% for all 3 groups. At all time points, HPA axis function was similar in the 88-microg fluticasone group compared with the placebo group. For mean change from baseline in corticotropin-stimulated peak cortisol (P = .003 and P = .02 at weeks 24 and 52, respectively) and area under the stimulated plasma cortisol vs time curve (P = .002 and P = .02 at weeks 24 and 52, respectively), statistically significant reductions from baseline were observed in the 440-microg fluticasone group compared with the placebo group. These reductions of 10% to 13% from baseline were not accompanied by other signs of systemic effect and did not persist with continued treatment (at weeks 76 and 104). No important ocular changes were observed. Long-term treatment with 88 microg of fluticasone twice daily was comparable to placebo in all skeletal, ophthalmic, and HPA axis function assessments. Treatment with fluticasone at 440 microg twice daily resulted in no significant effects on BMD and a statistically significant but not clinically important temporary reduction in cortisol production.",A fair-quality 2004 randomized controlled trials did not demonstrate any clinically relevant effect on bone mineral density at 2 years follow-up. This study used 800 mcg/day of fluticasone for patients with mild asthma.
"What is the dietary treatment for low high density lipoprotein cholesterol
Plasma levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) at entry and subsequent changes from these baseline levels were inversely predictive of coronary heart disease (CHD) end points in hypercholesterolemic men followed for 7 to 10 years in the Lipid Research Clinics Coronary Primary Prevention Trial, especially in the 1907 participants receiving cholestyramine. When the men in this cohort were compared, each 1 mg/dl increment in baseline HDL-C (mean 44.3 mg/dl) was associated with a 5.5% decrement in risk of ""definite"" CHD death or myocardial infarction (Z = -5.4), and each 1 mg/dl increase from baseline HDL-C levels (mean increase = 1.6 mg/dl) during the trial was associated with a 4.4% risk reduction (Z = -2.2). In the 1899 participants receiving placebo, the corresponding risk decrements were 3.4% and 1.1%. Although baseline HDL-C level (mean = 44.4 mg/dl) remained a significant risk predictor (Z = -3.8) in the placebo cohort, increases in HDL-C (mean increase 0.5 mg/dl) were not significantly predictive of CHD (Z = -0.6) unless ""suspect"" as well as ""definite"" end points were analyzed (Z = -2.0). When the associations between HDL-C (baseline plus change) and incidence of definite CHD end points within each treatment cohort were compared, their difference approached nominal significance (Z = 1.9). The results suggest a synergistic interaction, in which cholestyramine treatment reduced CHD risk most substantially in men maintaining the highest HDL-C levels.","A systematic review with meta-analysis of 5 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of low-carbohydrate versus low-fat diets showed a 10% increase in high density lipoprotein attributed to the low-carbohydrate diet, which translated to an absolute increase of 4.6 mg/dL (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.5-8.1)."
"What's the best way to screen for anxiety and panic disorders
Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is one of the most common mental disorders; however, there is no brief clinical measure for assessing GAD. The objective of this study was to develop a brief self-report scale to identify probable cases of GAD and evaluate its reliability and validity. A criterion-standard study was performed in 15 primary care clinics in the United States from November 2004 through June 2005. Of a total of 2740 adult patients completing a study questionnaire, 965 patients had a telephone interview with a mental health professional within 1 week. For criterion and construct validity, GAD self-report scale diagnoses were compared with independent diagnoses made by mental health professionals; functional status measures; disability days; and health care use. A 7-item anxiety scale (GAD-7) had good reliability, as well as criterion, construct, factorial, and procedural validity. A cut point was identified that optimized sensitivity (89%) and specificity (82%). Increasing scores on the scale were strongly associated with multiple domains of functional impairment (all 6 Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form General Health Survey scales and disability days). Although GAD and depression symptoms frequently co-occurred, factor analysis confirmed them as distinct dimensions. Moreover, GAD and depression symptoms had differing but independent effects on functional impairment and disability. There was good agreement between self-report and interviewer-administered versions of the scale. The GAD-7 is a valid and efficient tool for screening for GAD and assessing its severity in clinical practice and research.","For diagnosing generalized anxiety disorder, the GAD-7 has the best evidence for its utility. It was studied in a large, primary care-based sample size, is brief, and is in the public domain. It has a positive likelihood ratio of 4.9 (ie, the odds that a person has generalized anxiety disorder are 4.9 times higher if the GAD-7 is positive)."
"How does colonoscopy compare with fecal occult blood testing as a screening tool for colon cancer
Three randomised trials have demonstrated reduction in mortality from colorectal cancer (CRC) by repeated screening with faecal occult blood tests, including the trial presented here, which is the only one still in progress. To evaluate reduction in mortality after seven screening rounds and the possible influence of compliance on mortality from CRC. At Funen in Denmark, random allocation to biennial screening with Hemoccult-II in 30 967 subjects aged 45-75 years and 30,966 controls was performed in 1985 from a population of 137,485 of the same age. Only participants who completed the first screening round were invited for further screening. Colonoscopy was offered if the test was positive. The primary end point was death from CRC, and the 10 year results were published in 1996. From the beginning of the first screening to the seventh round, mean age increased from 59.8 to 70.0 years in the screening and control groups, and the male/female ratio decreased from 0.92 to 0.81. Those who accepted screening were younger than non-responders. Positivity rates varied from 0.8% to 3.8%, the cumulative ratio of a positive test was 5.1% after seven rounds, and 4.8% of patients had at least one colonoscopy. Mortality from CRC was significantly less in the screening group (relative risk (RR) 0.82 (0.69-0.97)), and the reduction in mortality was most pronounced above the sigmoid colon. After seven rounds, RR was reduced to less than 0.70 compared with controls. Mortality rates from causes other than CRC did not differ. Non-responders had a significantly increased risk of death from CRC compared with those who accepted the full programme. Subjects who accepted the first screening, but not subsequent ones, demonstrated a tendency towards increased risk. The persistent reduction in mortality from CRC in a biennial screening program with Hemoccult-II, and a reduction in RR to less than 0.70 in those adhering to the programme, support attempts to introduce larger scale population screening programmes. The smaller effect on mortality from CRC in the rectum and sigmoid colon suggests evaluation by additional flexible sigmoidoscopy with longer intervals.","Long-term follow up of one of the RCTs in a Cochrane review showed a continued reduction in colorectal cancer mortality of 34% (RR=0.66; 95% CI, 0.54-0.81) in subjects adhering to the fecal occult blood test screening protocol over a 13-year interval. Overall mortality did not differ between the screened and unscreened groups."
"What are contraindications to IUDs
To clarify the effect of the using the intrauterine device on fertility in nulliparous women. Prospective cohort study of two groups of nulliparous women, one recruited while using an intrauterine device and the other while using an oral contraceptive. Seventeen family planning clinics in England and Scotland. 1,071 nulliparous, married women, aged 18-40 years, 558 of whom contributed information to the main objective of the study. The women were recruited between 1982 and 1985 and followed up annually to 1994. Dates and reasons for any contraceptive method changes (which were most frequently to barrier methods) were recorded, together with the outcome of any pregnancies, at each follow up. The number of nulliparous women giving birth at term after stopping contraception (oral contraceptive, intrauterine device or barrier method) in order to conceive. Women who stopped using a barrier method to achieve a planned pregnancy conceived most quickly: 54% were delivered after one year vs 39% of intrauterine device and 32% of oral contraceptive users (log rank P = 0.002). There was no association between fertility and duration of oral contraceptive use: However, short term intrauterine device users (< 42 months) showed a fertility pattern more favourable than seen in those discontinuing oral contraceptives, with increasing duration of intrauterine device use being associated with decreasing fertility (linear trend P = 0.005); the fertility of women who had used the intrauterine device for 78 + months was the most impaired (28% were delivered by 12 months vs 46% of short term users; at 36 months the corresponding figures were 79% vs 91%). This association remained after adjusting for potential confounding factors, including maternal age, husband's social class, and history of gynaecological illnesses, factors which themselves had independent associations with fertility. Long term intrauterine device use in nulliparous women appears to be associated with an increased risk of fertility impairment.","One cohort study demonstrated lower fertility with use of a copper IUD for longer periods: hazard ratio (HR): 0.69 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.497-0.97) for 42-78 months; HR=0.50 (95% CI, 0.34-0.73) for >78 months."
"How should we manage infants at risk for group B streptococcal disease
Guidelines issued in 1996 in the United States recommend either screening of pregnant women for group B streptococcal colonization by means of cultures (screening approach) or assessing clinical risk factors (risk-based approach) to identify candidates for intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis. In a multistate retrospective cohort study, we compared the effectiveness of the screening and risk-based approaches in preventing early-onset group B streptococcal disease (in infants less than seven days old). We studied a stratified random sample of the 629,912 live births in 1998 and 1999 in eight geographical areas where there was active surveillance for group B streptococcal infection, including all births in which the neonate had early-onset disease. Women with no documented culture for group B streptococcus were considered to have been cared for according to the risk-based approach. We studied 5144 births, including 312 in which the newborn had early-onset group B streptococcal disease. Antenatal screening was documented for 52 percent of the mothers. The risk of early-onset disease was significantly lower among the infants of screened women than among those in the risk-based group (adjusted relative risk, 0.46; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.36 to 0.60). Because women whose providers had no strategy for prophylaxis may have been misclassified in the risk-based group, we excluded all women with risk factors and adequate time for prophylaxis who did not receive antibiotics. The adjusted relative risk of early-onset disease associated with the screening approach in this secondary analysis was similar--0.48 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.37 to 0.63). Routine screening for group B streptococcus during pregnancy prevents more cases of early-onset disease than the risk-based approach. Recommendations that endorse both strategies as equivalent warrant reconsideration.","A multicenter population-based study demonstrated that basing prophylaxis on screening cultures is twice as effective as risk stratification, a previously recommended strategy."
"When are antibiotics indicated for acute COPD exacerbations
Most patients with an exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are treated with antibiotics. However the value of their use remains uncertain. Some controlled trials of antibiotics have shown benefit (Berry 1960; Pines 1972) while others have not (Elmes 1965b; Nicotra 1982). To conduct a systematic review of the literature estimating the value of antibiotics in the management of acute COPD exacerbations. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 4, 2005); MEDLINE (1966 to December 2005); EMBASE (1974 to December 2005); Web of Science (December 2005), and other electronically available databases. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in patients with acute COPD exacerbations comparing antibiotic (for a minimum of five days) and placebo. Data were analysed using Review Manager software. Continuous data were analysed using weighted mean differences (WMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Relative risks (RR) (and 95% CI) were calculated for all dichotomous data. Where appropriate, number needed to treat to benefit (NNT) and 95% CI were calculated. Eleven trials with 917 patients were included. Ten trials used increased cough, sputum volume and purulence diagnostic criteria for COPD exacerbation. Eight-hundred and fifty-seven patients provided data for outcomes including mortality, treatment failure, increased sputum volume, sputum purulence, PaCO(2), PaO(2), peak flow and adverse events. Antibiotic therapy regardless of antibiotic choice significantly reduced mortality (RR 0.23; 95% CI 0.10 to 0.52 with NNT of 8; 95% CI 6 to 17), treatment failure (RR 0.47; 95% CI 0.36 to 0.62 with NNT of 3; 95% CI 3 to 5) and sputum purulence (RR 0.56; 95% CI 0.41 to 0.77 with NNT of 8; 95% CI 6 to 17). There was a small increase in risk of diarrhoea with antibiotics (RR 2.86; 95% CI 1.06 to 7.76). Antibiotics did not improve arterial blood gases and peak flow. This review shows that in COPD exacerbations with increased cough and sputum purulence antibiotics, regardless of choice, reduce the risk of short-term mortality by 77%, decrease the risk of treatment failure by 53% and the risk of sputum purulence by 44%; with a small increase in the risk of diarrhoea. These results should be interpreted with caution due to the differences in patient selection, antibiotic choice, small number of included trials and lack of control for interventions that influence outcome, such as use of systemic corticosteroids and ventilatory support. Nevertheless, this review supports antibiotics for patients with COPD exacerbations with increased cough and sputum purulence who are moderately or severely ill.","A recent Cochrane review identified 11 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (with a total of 917 patients) addressing antibiotic therapy for COPD exacerbations characterized by 1 or more of the following: an increase in sputum purulence or volume, dyspnea, wheezing, chest tightness, or fluid retention. Eight trials were conducted on hospital wards, 1 was in a medical intensive care unit, and 2 trials were in the outpatient setting. Antibiotics were given orally in 9 of the 11 studies. Overall, antibiotics reduced risk of short-term mortality by 77% (relative risk [RR]=0.23; 95% confidence interval [CI],0.10-0.52; number needed to treat [NNT]=8), treatment failure by 53% (RR=0.47; 95% CI, 0.36-0.62; NNT=3), and sputum purulence by 44% (RR=0.56; 95% CI, 0.41-0.77; NNT=8). A subgroup analysis that excluded the outpatient and intensive-care unit studies did not change the result. Another subgroup analysis of the 2 outpatient studies failed to find a significant effect, although the studies had very different designs."
"Which nondrug alternatives can help with insomnia
Approximately 20% of patients presenting in general medical settings have severe and persistent insomnia. Studies consistently find that trouble initiating and maintaining sleep are independent risk factors for medical and psychiatric morbidity, but insomnia is often underdetected and undertreated in primary care settings. Cognitive-behavioral treatment approaches for chronic insomnia and related sleep disorders have been shown to be effective in various patient populations. This article reviews the most common cognitive-behavioral interventions for insomnia, and discusses their efficacy and durability. Possible adaptations for the integration of these approaches into primary care settings and a description of the emerging field of behavioral sleep medicine as a resource for health care providers treating patients with chronic insomnia are also presented.","cognitive-behavioral treatment interventions are based on the notion that distorted thoughts about sleep and learned behavior patterns hyperarouse the central nervous system and deregulate sleep cycles, resulting in chronic insomnia."
"What are the risks and benefits of elective induction for uncomplicated term pregnancies
To determine if elective induction (IND) increases the risk of cesarean delivery compared to expectant management (EM). A randomized clinical trial involving women 39 weeks' gestation, according to strict dating criteria, with a Bishop score of 5 or more in nulliparous patients and 4 or more in multiparous patients. The control group was expectantly managed and delivered for obstetric indications, but not later than 42 weeks' gestation. The study had 80% power to detect a three-fold increase in cesarean delivery. One-hundred-and-sixteen patients (45 nulliparous) were randomized to IND and 110 (58 nulliparous) to EM. Demographic characteristics were no different between the groups. The cesarean delivery rate in the IND group was 6.9% (8/116) compared to 7.3% (8/110) in the EM group (p = NS). Rates of cesarean delivery for nulliparous patients randomized to IND compared to EM were also not significantly different: 13.3% (6/45) versus 10.3% (6/58) respectively (p = NS). Neonates delivered of IND patients weighed less than those of the EM group (3459 +/- 347 versus 3604 +/- 438, p = 0.006). In women with favorable Bishop scores, elective induction of labor resulted in no increase in cesarean delivery compared to expectant management.","A randomized controlled trial, found a much lower incidence of cesarean section and operative vaginal deliveries among induced vs expectantly managed women at term."
"How best to manage the patient in term labor whose group B strep status is unknown
Guidelines issued in 1996 in the United States recommend either screening of pregnant women for group B streptococcal colonization by means of cultures (screening approach) or assessing clinical risk factors (risk-based approach) to identify candidates for intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis. In a multistate retrospective cohort study, we compared the effectiveness of the screening and risk-based approaches in preventing early-onset group B streptococcal disease (in infants less than seven days old). We studied a stratified random sample of the 629,912 live births in 1998 and 1999 in eight geographical areas where there was active surveillance for group B streptococcal infection, including all births in which the neonate had early-onset disease. Women with no documented culture for group B streptococcus were considered to have been cared for according to the risk-based approach. We studied 5144 births, including 312 in which the newborn had early-onset group B streptococcal disease. Antenatal screening was documented for 52 percent of the mothers. The risk of early-onset disease was significantly lower among the infants of screened women than among those in the risk-based group (adjusted relative risk, 0.46; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.36 to 0.60). Because women whose providers had no strategy for prophylaxis may have been misclassified in the risk-based group, we excluded all women with risk factors and adequate time for prophylaxis who did not receive antibiotics. The adjusted relative risk of early-onset disease associated with the screening approach in this secondary analysis was similar--0.48 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.37 to 0.63). Routine screening for group B streptococcus during pregnancy prevents more cases of early-onset disease than the risk-based approach. Recommendations that endorse both strategies as equivalent warrant reconsideration.","A multistate retrospective cohort study (N=5144) concluded that universal screening by culture for group b streptococcus at 35 to 37 weeks' gestation is more effective than treating patients based on risk-factor criteria (relative risk [RR]=0.46; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.36-0.60)."
"Are breast self-exams or clinical exams effective for screening breast cancer
To synthesize new data on breast cancer screening for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. MEDLINE; the Cochrane Controlled Trials Registry; and reference lists of reviews, editorials, and original studies. Eight randomized, controlled trials of mammography and 2 trials evaluating breast self-examination were included. One hundred fifty-four publications of the results of these trials, as well as selected articles about the test characteristics and harms associated with screening, were examined. Predefined criteria were used to assess the quality of each study. Meta-analyses using a Bayesian random-effects model were conducted to provide summary relative risk estimates and credible intervals (CrIs) for the effectiveness of screening with mammography in reducing death from breast cancer. For studies of fair quality or better, the summary relative risk was 0.84 (95% CrI, 0.77 to 0.91) and the number needed to screen to prevent one death from breast cancer after approximately 14 years of observation was 1224 (CrI, 665 to 2564). Among women younger than 50 years of age, the summary relative risk associated with mammography was 0.85 (CrI, 0.73 to 0.99) and the number needed to screen to prevent one death from breast cancer after 14 years of observation was 1792 (CrI, 764 to 10 540). For clinical breast examination and breast self-examination, evidence from randomized trials is inconclusive. In the randomized, controlled trials, mammography reduced breast cancer mortality rates among women 40 to 74 years of age. Greater absolute risk reduction was seen among older women. Because these results incorporate several rounds of screening, the actual number of mammograms needed to prevent one death from breast cancer is higher. In addition, each screening has associated risks and costs.","The CNBSS-2 trial showed no mortality advantage when mammography was added to an annual, standardized 10- to 15-minute breast examination, implying that careful, detailed, annual clinical breast examinations may be as effective as a mammography screening program."
"What is the best way to identify patients with white-coat hypertension
The clinical significance of white-coat hypertension is still unclear. Moreover, no study has examined metabolic predictors of white-coat versus sustained hypertension. We investigated men (n=602) in a longitudinal population-based cohort who at age 70 years were identified as normotensive, white-coat hypertensive (office blood pressure [BP] > or =140/90 and daytime ambulatory BP <135/85 mm Hg), and sustained hypertensive (office BP > or =140/90 and daytime ambulatory BP > or =135/85 mm Hg). At baseline, when the subjects were aged 50 years, blood glucose, insulin, lipids, and fatty acid composition of the serum cholesterol esters were analyzed. The investigations at age 70 years included determination of insulin sensitivity and target organ damage. At age 50 years, individuals who 20 years later were identified as white-coat hypertensive or sustained hypertensive showed significantly elevated BP, heart rate, and impaired glucose tolerance compared with normotensive subjects but white coat hypertensive subjects were leaner and had a more favorable serum cholesterol ester fatty acid profile than did sustained hypertensive subjects. At age 70 years, both white-coat and sustained hypertensive subjects showed an impaired insulin sensitivity, elevated blood glucose, and increased serum insulin and heart rate compared with normotensive subjects, but left ventricular mass and urinary albumin excretion were increased only in sustained hypertensive subjects. These findings indicate that although metabolic abnormalities and elevated heart rate were consistent over time in both hypertensive groups, a lower body mass index and more favorable dietary fat composition predicted the development of white-coat as opposed to sustained hypertension over 20 years.","A study of more than 600 men over 20 years in Finland compared those who developed white-coat hypertension and those with sustained hypertension. The hypertensive patients had more microalbuminuria, a greater left ventricular mass on echo, increased cholesterol esters, and a greater body-mass index (all P.05) than patients with white-coat hypertension. Smoking status was similar in both groups, in contrast to other studies."
"How does colonoscopy compare with fecal occult blood testing as a screening tool for colon cancer
To assess the effectiveness of different colorectal cancer screening tests for adults at average risk. Recent systematic reviews; Guide to Clinical Preventive Services, 2nd edition; and focused searches of MEDLINE from 1966 through September 2001. The authors also conducted hand searches, reviewed bibliographies, and consulted context experts to ensure completeness. When available, the most recent high-quality systematic review was used to identify relevant articles. This review was then supplemented with a MEDLINE search for more recent articles. One reviewer abstracted information from the final set of studies into evidence tables, and a second reviewer checked the tables for accuracy. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus. For average-risk adults older than 50 years of age, evidence from multiple well-conducted randomized trials supported the effectiveness of fecal occult blood testing in reducing colorectal cancer incidence and mortality rates compared with no screening. Data from well-conducted case-control studies supported the effectiveness of sigmoidoscopy and possibly colonoscopy in reducing colon cancer incidence and mortality rates. A nonrandomized, controlled trial examining colorectal cancer mortality rates and randomized trials examining diagnostic yield supported the use of fecal occult blood testing plus sigmoidoscopy. The effectiveness of barium enema is unclear. Data are insufficient to support a definitive determination of the most effective screening strategy. Colorectal cancer screening reduces death from colorectal cancer and can decrease the incidence of disease through removal of adenomatous polyps. Several available screening options seem to be effective, but the single best screening approach cannot be determined because data are insufficient.","The us preventive services task force review did not find any screening trials of colonoscopy but analyzed data from the National Polyp Study and a case-control study to draw its conclusions. The review reported an odds ratio for colorectal cancer mortality for patients who had colonoscopy to be 0.43 (95% CI, 0.30-63)."
"Does lowering diastolic blood pressure to less than 90 mm Hg decrease cardiovascular risk
Despite treatment, there is often a higher incidence of cardiovascular complications in patients with hypertension than in normotensive individuals. Inadequate reduction of their blood pressure is a likely cause, but the optimum target blood pressure is not known. The impact of acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) has never been investigated in patients with hypertension. We aimed to assess the optimum target diastolic blood pressure and the potential benefit of a low dose of acetylsalicylic acid in the treatment of hypertension. 18790 patients, from 26 countries, aged 50-80 years (mean 61.5 years) with hypertension and diastolic blood pressure between 100 mm Hg and 115 mm Hg (mean 105 mm Hg) were randomly assigned a target diastolic blood pressure. 6264 patients were allocated to the target pressure < or =90 mm Hg, 6264 to < or =85 mm Hg, and 6262 to < or =80 mm Hg. Felodipine was given as baseline therapy with the addition of other agents, according to a five-step regimen. In addition, 9399 patients were randomly assigned 75 mg/day acetylsalicylic acid (Bamycor, Astra) and 9391 patients were assigned placebo. Diastolic blood pressure was reduced by 20.3 mm Hg, 22.3 mm Hg, and 24.3 mm Hg, in the < or =90 mm Hg, < or =85 mm Hg, and < or =80 mm Hg target groups, respectively. The lowest incidence of major cardiovascular events occurred at a mean achieved diastolic blood pressure of 82.6 mm Hg; the lowest risk of cardiovascular mortality occurred at 86.5 mm Hg. Further reduction below these blood pressures was safe. In patients with diabetes mellitus there was a 51% reduction in major cardiovascular events in target group < or =80 mm Hg compared with target group < or =90 mm Hg (p for trend=0.005). Acetylsalicylic acid reduced major cardiovascular events by 15% (p=0.03) and all myocardial infarction by 36% (p=0.002), with no effect on stroke. There were seven fatal bleeds in the acetylsalicylic acid group and eight in the placebo group, and 129 versus 70 non-fatal major bleeds in the two groups, respectively (p<0.001). Intensive lowering of blood pressure in patients with hypertension was associated with a low rate of cardiovascular events. The HOT Study shows the benefits of lowering the diastolic blood pressure down to 82.6 mm Hg. Acetylsalicylic acid significantly reduced major cardiovascular events with the greatest benefit seen in all myocardial infarction. There was no effect on the incidence of stroke or fatal bleeds, but non-fatal major bleeds were twice as common.","The Hypertension Optimal Treatment (HOT) trial was specifically designed to determine the optimal target blood pressure for hypertensive patients: 18,790 men and women with diastolic blood pressure 100 to 115 mm Hg were randomly assigned to target diastolic blood pressure groups of <90, <85, or <80 mm Hg. All were treated with felodipine and other agents in a stepped-care protocol; average follow-up was 3.8 years. The lowest incidence of cardiovascular events occurred at a mean diastolic blood pressure of 82.6 mm Hg and fewest cardiovascular deaths at 86.5 mm Hg. Further reductions in diastolic blood pressure neither lowered nor increased cardiovascular risk."
"What measures relieve postherpetic neuralgia
The main risk factor for postherpetic neuralgia is increasing age; it is uncommon in people under 50 years, but develops in 20% of people aged 60-65 years who have had acute herpes zoster, and in more than 30% of those people aged over 80 years. Up to 2% of people with acute herpes zoster may continue to have postherpetic pain for 5 years or more. METHODS AND OUTCOMES: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of interventions, during an acute attack of herpes zoster, aimed at preventing postherpetic neuralgia? What are the effects of interventions to relieve established postherpetic neuralgia after the rash has healed? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to December 2006 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). We found 28 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions. In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: corticosteroids, dextromethorphan, dressings, gabapentin, oral antiviral agents, oral opioid analgesics, topical anaesthesia (lidocaine), topical antiviral agents (idoxuridine), topical counterirritants (capsaicin), tricyclic antidepressants.","A systematic review reported only limited evidence of effectiveness.6 In pooled results from systematic reviews, opioids decreased pain by 50% on the visual analogue scale (NNT=2.67; 95% CI, 2.10-3.77). Tramadol, a selective opioid agonist, showed moderate effectiveness in a small randomized controlled trials (N=125), with an number needed to treat of 4.76 (95% CI, 2.61-26.97)."
"Does the age you introduce food to an infant affect allergies later
To evaluate existing data from published studies investigating outcomes (growth, nutritional status and morbidity) in relation to the age of introduction of complementary foods to the healthy full-term infant. To assess the methodological quality of current scientific evidence on which infant feeding recommendations are based. A database was created following a search of electronic databases MEDLINE and BIDS, a handsearch of relevant journals and consultation with international experts in infant feeding practices. The search was conducted during a 6-month period and encompassed the years 1982-1998. Randomised/non-randomised controlled trials and cohort studies investigating the relationship to the health of full-term infants of the introduction of complementary foods to childhood health. Assessment of studies for inclusion and their compliance with methodological criteria was undertaken independently by two reviewers and discrepancies were resolved by discussion. From over 400 published papers identified, 33 met specific inclusion criteria. Significant differences in baseline characteristics of subjects in included studies meant that data were not amenable to meta-analysis. The consensus of the authors was that, of the 33 included publications, 13 contained data supporting the current WHO recommendations which attempt to accommodate all infants, including those whose nutritional requirements are not met by exclusive breast-feeding for 6 months. An equal number contained data that would support a recommendation for delaying the introduction of complementary foods until 6 months of age within the study population. The remaining seven were unable to provide evidence to support a change from the current WHO infant feeding recommendations which state that 'infants should be fed exclusively on breast milk from birth to 4-6 months of age'. None of the studies met all the methodological criteria. This review has shown that there is a lack of clear evidence to either support or refute a change to the current recommendations for the age of introduction of complementary foods to the breast milk or formula fed infant. Whilst exclusive breast feeding for the first 6 months of life can support growth and development in some infants, sub-groups have been identified within certain populations who may require complementary feeding prior to this age.","There is speculation that introducing certain solid foods early increases the risk of allergies to these foods, as well as causing generalized atopic symptoms. Few studies have examined this, and no systematic reviews focus on atopic disease."
"What is the best way to identify patients with white-coat hypertension
The rise in blood pressure (BP) associated with clinical visit (white coat effect) may be one basic mechanism of white coat hypertension (persistently raised clinic BP together with a normal BP outside the clinic), but the relations between white coat hypertension, white coat effect, and target organ damage have not yet been assessed on large populations. Thus, we performed 24-h noninvasive ambulatory BP monitoring and 2D-guided M-mode echocardiography in 1,333 untreated subjects with essential hypertension and 178 control normotensive subjects. White coat hypertension was defined by an average daytime ambulatory BP < 131/86 mm Hg in women and < 136/87 mm Hg in men and its prevalence was 18.9% (n = 252). The white coat effect was calculated for systolic and diastolic BP as the difference between clinic BP and average daytime ambulatory BP. Echocardiographic left ventricular mass was slightly but not significantly greater in the group with white coat hypertension than in the normotensive group (93 v 87 g/m2, P = NS), and increased in the group with ambulatory hypertension (112 g/m2, P < .01). The prevalence of white coat hypertension markedly decreased from the first to the fourth Joint National Committee V (JNC V) stage of severity of hypertension (186/559 subjects (33%) in I; 59/501 (11%) in II; 7/230 (3%) in III; 0/43 (0%) in IV; P < .001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","In another analysis of 1333 Italian subjects, the prevalence of white-coat hypertension was 33.3% in those with stage I hypertension, 11% with stage II, and 3 % with stage III."
"What is the best way to evaluate secondary infertility
To clarify the role of a combined diagnostic approach using laparoscopy and hysteroscopy in the evaluation of female infertility in developing countries. In a prospective study, 612 consecutive infertile women underwent complete fertility evaluation at a tertiary university infertility clinic: 300 complained of primary infertility, 221 of secondary infertility, and 91 were requesting reversal of a previous tubal ligation. All the patients were examined by simultaneous combined laparoscopy and hysteroscopy as a part of their routine infertility evaluation. Focused hysteroscopic evaluation of the region of utero-tubal junction was attempted. Laparoscopy was successful in 608 and hysteroscopy in 597 patients. The most frequent pathologies detected hysteroscopically in the infertile group were adhesive in nature and believed to be post-traumatic and/or post-phlogistic. The number of intrauterine abnormalities found by hysteroscopy was significantly greater than by hysterosalpingography. The rate of diagnosis of significant lesions by laparoscopy of 64.3% rose to 76.6% when the hysteroscopic findings were included. A significant number of women with secondary infertility had abnormal hysteroscopic findings when compared to either women with primary infertility or those requesting sterilization reversal. Hysteroscopic evaluation of the region of utero-tubal junction revealed significant lesions believed to have caused infertility in comparison with those requesting sterilization reversal. The combined diagnostic approach of laparoscopy and hysteroscopy is recommended in the evaluation of female infertility in communities where the risk of pelvic infections is great.","One study demonstrated increased diagnostic yield with a combined approach of hysteroscopy and laparoscopy, in communities where the risk of pelvic infection was great."
"What is the best approach for managing recurrent bacterial vaginosis
Accumulating evidence has associated bacterial vaginosis (BV) with serious medical complications such as premature delivery. The present article synthesizes available data on the treatment of nonpregnant and pregnant women with BV to prevent preterm delivery. A literature search identified articles published since 1976 that evaluated treatment of BV. An intention-to-treat sensitivity analysis was performed, to better compare studies. Studies that evaluated therapy efficacy varied with regard to diagnostic criteria, patient characteristics, clinicians, and laboratories. Therapies varied in efficacy for cure 4 or more weeks after therapy, from 48% to 85%. Intervention studies to reduce BV-related adverse outcomes of pregnancy differed in populations studied, medication used, type of therapy (oral or intravaginal), and timing of treatment. The benefit of treating women at high risk with oral metronidazole has been shown in several studies; however, the effect of treating women without a history of premature delivery is unclear. The use of intravaginal clindamycin therapy, especially during the latter half of the second trimester and thereafter, appears to increase infections during the neonatal period.","A meta-analysis by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) bacterial vaginosis working group reviewed the indications for therapy and best treatments for bacterial vaginosis. The group found 25 trials evaluating oral metronidazole therapy involving 2742 women. Although cure rates using either 500 mg twice daily for 5 to 7 days or 2 g as a single dose were similar at 2 weeks post follow-up (85%; range 67%-98%), the single-dose regimen led to higher relapse rates 1 month after treatment (35%-50% vs 20%-33%). Six trials enrolling 946 women assessed the efficacy of various topical vaginal treatments. Metronidazole gel, clindamycin cream, and clindamycin ovules had a wide range of initial cure rates (50%-95%), but all had higher relapse rates at 4 weeks than did oral metronidazole for 1 week (34%-49%)."
"Does ambulatory blood pressure monitoring aid in the management of patients with hypertension
Ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) monitoring is used increasingly in clinical practice, but how it affects treatment of blood pressure has not been determined. To compare conventional blood pressure (CBP) measurement and ABP measurement in the management of hypertensive patients. Multicenter, randomized, parallel-group trial. Family practices and outpatient clinics at regional and university hospitals. A total of 419 patients (> or =18 years), whose untreated diastolic blood pressure (DBP) on CBP measurement averaged 95 mm Hg or higher, randomized to CBP or ABP arms. Antihypertensive drug treatment was adjusted in a stepwise fashion based on either the average daytime (from 10 AM to 8 PM) ambulatory DBP (n=213) or the average of 3 sitting DBP readings (n=206). If the DBP guiding treatment was above (>89 mm Hg), at (80-89 mm Hg), or below (<80 mm Hg) target, 1 physician blinded to the patients' randomization intensified antihypertensive treatment, left it unchanged, or reduced it, respectively. The CBP and ABP levels, intensity of drug treatment, electrocardiographic and echocardiographic left ventricular mass, symptoms reported by questionnaire, and cost. At the end of the study (median follow-up, 182 days; 5th to 95th percentile interval, 85-258 days), more ABP than CBP patients had stopped antihypertensive drug treatment (26.3% vs 7.3%; P<.001), and fewer ABP patients had progressed to sustained multiple-drug treatment (27.2% vs 42.7%; P<.001). The final CBP and 24-hour ABP averaged 144.1/89.9 mm Hg and 129.4/79.5 mm Hg in the ABP group and 140.3/89.6 mm Hg and 128.0/79.1 mm Hg in the CBP group. Left ventricular mass and reported symptoms were similar in the 2 groups. The potential savings in the ABP group in terms of less intensive drug treatment and fewer physician visits were offset by the costs of ABP monitoring. Adjustment of antihypertensive treatment based on ABP monitoring instead of CBP measurement led to less intensive drug treatment with preservation of blood pressure control, general well-being, and inhibition of left ventricular enlargement but did not reduce the overall costs of antihypertensive treatment.","In a randomized parallel-group trial, 419 untreated patients were followed up using either ambulatory blood pressure monitoring or conventional office measurements to initiate and adjust antihypertensive therapy."
"How should we follow up a positive screen for anemia in a 1-year old
Standard therapy for anemia in infants is ferrous sulfate drops administered 3 times/d. Adherence to treatment, however, is often poor. One likely reason for poor adherence is the unpleasant side effects associated with drops. The objective was to evaluate the use of a new form of iron and a delivery system to treat anemia in infants that is likely to produce better adherence to treatment. Using a prospective, randomized, controlled design, we studied 557 anemic children aged 6-18 mo (hemoglobin: 70-99 g/L) in rural Ghana. One group received a daily sachet of microencapsulated ferrous fumarate (80 mg elemental Fe) in powder form plus ascorbic acid to be sprinkled onto any complementary food eaten (sprinkles group); a control group received ferrous sulfate drops 3 times/d for 2 mo (total dose: 40 mg elemental Fe). Hemoglobin and serum ferritin concentrations were measured at baseline and at the end of treatment. Successful treatment of anemia (hemoglobin > 100 g/L) occurred in 58% of the sprinkles group and in 56% of the drops group, with minimal side effects in both groups. Geometric mean ferritin concentrations increased significantly in each group from baseline to the end of treatment (P < 0.001). Use of ferrous sulfate drops or a single daily dose of microencapsulated ferrous fumarate sprinkles plus ascorbic acid resulted in a similar rate of successful treatment of anemia without side effects. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of the use of microencapsulated iron sprinkles to treat anemia. Improved ease of use may favor the use of sprinkles to deliver iron.",A study demonstrated that iron sulfate drops (40 mg elemental iron divided 3 times a day) or a single daily dose of microencapsulated ferrous fumarate sprinkles (80 mg elemental iron) plus ascorbic acid resulted in a similar rate of successful treatment of anemia without side effects.
"What is the best treatment for plantar fasciitis
Forty-three patients (47 heels) underwent decompression of the nerve to abductor digiti minimi with partial plantar fascia release for intractable plantar fasciitis over a 4-year period. Forty-one patients (45 heels) were available for follow-up. All of the patients had failed to respond to nonoperative treatment. The mean duration of symptoms before surgery was 34.8 months (range, 12-132 months), and the mean follow-up was 31.4 months (range, 11-66 months). Seventy percent of the patients in the study were overweight or obese. Before surgery, 39 patients (43 heels) rated their heel pain as severe. At follow-up, 34 of 45 (75.6%) of the heels were pain-free or only mildly painful. The mean visual analogue pain score dropped from 8.5 of 10 preoperatively to 2.5 of 10 postoperatively. Only four patients failed to report an improvement in their activity restrictions, and only one patient had a walking distance of under 100 m after surgery; this patient had been affected by a reflex sympathetic dystrophy. Overall, however, only 20 of 41 patients were totally satisfied with the outcome (48.8%). We recommend that the small group of patients who fail to respond to nonoperative treatment be considered for surgical intervention. The results in terms of symptomatic relief are generally good but in terms of patient satisfaction can only be rated as moderate. The patients should be counseled about the likely outcome of surgery.","In a prospective study of 43 patients with 47 painful heels followed for an average of 31 months, only 49% of the patients were satisfied with their outcome. Patient expectations should be considered in preoperative counseling. In contrast to surgery, either open or endoscopic, extracorporeal shock wave therapy does not require the patient avoid weightbearing or a prolonged time for return to work."
"Which diuretics are safe and effective for patients with a sulfa allergy
Celecoxib, a selective cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitor, is a diaryl-substituted pyrazole derivative containing a sulfonamide substituent. Because of this structural component, celecoxib is contraindicated for use in patients who have demonstrated allergic reactions to sulfonamides. However, there is a lack of data demonstrating cross-reactivity among sulfonamide medications. A sulfonamide is any compound with an SO2NH2 moiety. The major difference between sulfonamide antimicrobials and other sulfonamide-containing medications such as furosemide, thiazide diuretics and celecoxib, is that sulfonamide antimicrobials contain an aromatic amine group at the N4 position. This allows for division of the sulfonamides into 2 groups: aromatic amines (i.e., sulfonamide antimicrobials) and nonaromatic amines. In addition, sulfonamide antimicrobials contain a substituted ring at the N1-position; this group is not found with nonaromatic amine-containing sulfonamides. Adverse reactions to sulfonamide antimicrobials include type I, or immunoglobulin (Ig) E-mediated reactions, hypersensitivity syndrome reactions, and severe skin reactions such as toxic epidermal necrolysis. The aromatic amine portion of the sulfonamide antimicrobial is considered to be critical in the development of latter 2 reactions. In susceptible individuals, the hydroxylamine metabolite is unable to be detoxified leading to a cascade of cytotoxic and immunological events that eventually results in the adverse reaction. Since celecoxib does not contain the aromatic amine, adverse reactions such as hypersensitivity syndrome reactions and toxic epidermal necrolysis would not be expected to occur at the same frequency as they do with sulfonamide antimicrobials. Similarly, for IgE-mediated reactions, the N1-substituent and not the sulphonamide moiety is important in determining specificity to antibodies. Celecoxib and other nonaromatic amine-containing sulfonamide medications do not contain the N1-substituent. Cross-reactivity among the various sulfonamide-containing medications has also not been substantiated by published case reports. In fact, conflicting information exists in the literature. Reports showing lack of cross-reactivity balance the few case reports suggesting cross-reactivity. Cross-reactivity between sulfonamide medications should be based on scientific data, including chemistry, metabolism, immune responses and clinical data. Based on the current information, there is no documentation for cross-reactivity between sulfonamide antimicrobials and other sulfonamide medications, such as celecoxib.",In a literature review-in which the main focus was cross-reactivity between sulfonamide antibiotics and celecoxib-the authors concluded that little evidence supported definitive cross-reactivity between sulfonamide antibiotics and diuretics.
"How useful are autoantibodies in diagnosing thyroid disorders
A new commercial method for measurement of anti-thyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO DYNOtest, Henning, Berlin) was evaluated in normal subjects and in patients with autoimmune thyroid and non-thyroid diseases, and compared to an immune fluorescence method for measurement of anti-microsomal antibodies (MicAb), and a radioimmunological method for quantifying thyroglobulin antibodies (TgAb). The majority of normal subjects had anti-TPO levels below 52 U/ml and patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis had levels above 200 U/ml, with a good correlation to MicAb. In other autoimmune thyroid diseases the correlation was less pronounced. In non-thyroid autoimmune diseases MicAb showed falsely positive reactions in the presence of other autoantibodies, e.g. mitochondrial antibodies. The present study indicates that the anti-TPO method should probably replace measurements of MicAb for routine clinical use, thus providing a sensitive, precise, antigen specific method with the ability to reveal quantitative fluctuations. The study also indicates that TgAb could be abolished in routine diagnosis of autoimmune thyroid diseases and be reserved for special clinical situations, research purposes as well as measurement in sera before evaluation of serum thyroglobulin levels.",One study of 235 people in a university endocrinology department found that a TPOAb level >190 U/mL yielded an LR+ of 10.75 and an LR- of 0.15 for chronic autoimmune (Hashimoto's) thyroiditis [CAHT]; the AMA-positive sera yielded an LR+ of 13.67 and an LR- of 0.19. Both TPOAb and AMA test characteristics were highly associated with CAHT (P<.001).
"What is the best strategy for monitoring the lipid-lowering effects of medical therapy used for the primary prevention of coronary artery disease coronary artery disease
The Münster Heart Study (PROCAM) was initiated in 1979 in order to examine cardiovascular risk factors, cardiovascular events including myocardial infarction and stroke, and mortality in people at work. Examination at entry comprised a standardized case history, measurement of blood pressure and anthropometric data, a resting electrocardiogram, and measurement of more than 20 laboratory parameters in a fasting blood sample. The prevalence data in this report are based upon a single examination of 17,437 men aged 40.4 +/- 11.3 years (mean +/- SD) and 8065 women aged 35.7 +/- 12.1 years, which took place between 1979 and 1991. Severe hypercholesterolaemia (> 300 mg.dl-1) was seen in 5% of men and 8% of women aged 45 to 64 years. In men, the prevalence of hypertriglyceridaemia (> 200 mg.dl-1) rose from 5% at age 20 to 20% at age 45 and remained constant thereafter; in women the prevalence of hypertriglyceridaemia increased linearly from 2% at age 20 to 7% at age 60. The LDL/HDL ratio was higher in men than in women at all age groups; in the age group 45 to 64 years, LDL/HDL ratios > 5 were approximately twice as common in men. Lipoprotein(a) levels were distributed in a highly skewed fashion. In men, a slight rise in the geometric mean lipoprotein(a) concentration occurred with age, whereas in women a dramatic increase was seen after age 40. Using multivariate analysis by the multiple logistic function method, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and log-transformed triglycerides showed a significant (P < 0.001) age-adjusted correlation with the presence of major coronary events. A risk algorithm has been developed for men aged 40 to 65 years which takes into account the independent risk factors of HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, fibrinogen, age, systolic blood pressure, cigarette smoking, presence of diabetes mellitus and family history of myocardial infarction and angina pectoris. This algorithm can be used in clinical practice to calculate the 8-year risk of an individual suffering a myocardial infarction.","The Munster Heart Study (PROCAM) demonstrated that ""the ranking of continuous risk factors in terms of predicting major coronary events was LDL-C, total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein (HDL-C), triglycerides (TG)...."""
"Which factors increase the risk of an infant becoming an overweight child
The association between early life factors and body mass index (BMI) in adulthood has been demonstrated in developed countries. The aim of the present study was to assess the influence of early life factors (birth weight, gestational age, maternal smoking, and social class) on BMI in young adulthood with adjustment for adult socioeconomic position. A cohort study was carried out in 1978/79 with 6827 mother-child pairs from Ribeirão Preto city, located in the most developed economic area of the country. Biological, economic and social variables and newborn anthropometric measurements were obtained shortly after delivery. In 1996, 1189 males from this cohort, 34.3% of the original male population, were submitted to anthropometric measurements and were asked about their current schooling on the occasion of army recruitment. A multiple linear regression model was applied to determine variables associated with BMI. Mean BMI was 22.7 (95%CI = 22.5-23.0). After adjustment, BMI was 1.22 kg/m(2) higher among infants born with high birth weight ( > or = 4000 g), 1.21 kg/m(2) higher among individuals of low social class at birth and 0.69 kg/m(2) higher among individuals whose mothers smoked during pregnancy (P < 0.05). The association between social class at birth and BMI remained statistically significant (P < 0.05) even after adjustment for adult schooling. These findings suggest that early life social influences on BMI were more important and were not reversed by late socioeconomic position. Therefore, prevention of overweight and obesity should focus not only on changes in adult life styles but also on factors such as high birth weight.","A Brazilian study found that children born in the lowest socioeconomic group had body mass index measurements at 18 years of age that were an average of 1.21 kg/m2 higher than children in the highest socioeconomic group (P<.05). The study controlled for birth weight, maternal smoking, gestational age, and level of schooling eventually achieved by the child."
"Does bed rest for preeclampsia improve neonatal outcomes
Forty patients participated in a randomized controlled trial of complete bed rest versus ambulation as desired in the management of proteinuric hypertension during pregnancy. Daily increases in serum human placental lactogen and oestriol concentrations were greater in the rested group. An especially 'at risk' group of 10 patients with both hyperuricaemia and severe fetal growth retardation was identified. Strict confinement to bed in these cases seemed to encourage the development of the premonitory symptoms of eclampsia, but was associated with a better prognosis for the fetus.","A small, unblinded randomized controlled trials of 40 preeclamptic patients treated in the hospital with strict bed confinement or without restrictions found no significant difference in fetal or perinatal mortality. No power calculations were reported for detecting differences in neonatal outcome rates in either of these studies."
"Is the ThinPrep better than conventional Pap smear at detecting cervical cancer
Every year approximately 2 million US women are diagnosed as having a cervical cytological result of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US). To determine the most efficient and cost-effective management strategy for women in the United States diagnosed as having ASC-US. Cost-effectiveness analysis of data from clinical trials, prospective studies, and other published literature. A computer-based model was used to compare 4 management strategies for a cytological result of ASC-US: immediate colposcopy; human papillomavirus (HPV) triage, which includes colposcopy if high-risk HPV types are detected; repeat cytology, which includes follow-up cytology at 6 and 12 months and referral for colposcopy if a repeat abnormal result occurs; and reclassifying ASC-US as normal in which a cytological result of ASC-US is ignored. Reflex HPV DNA testing uses either residual liquid-based cytological specimens or samples co-collected at the time of the initial screening for conventional cytology. Another method, referred to as the 2-visit HPV DNA triage, requires a woman with an ASC-US result to return within 1 month to provide another speciman sample. Years of life saved (YLS), quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. The least costly strategy for biennial screening was to reclassify ASC-US as normal, resulting in a reduction in total cancer incidence of 75% for conventional cytology and 84% for liquid-based cytology compared with no screening. The next least costly strategy was HPV DNA testing resulting in a reduction in total cancer incidence of 86% for conventional cytology and 90% for liquid-based cytology, followed by immediate colposcopy with a reduction of 87% and 91%, respectively. Compared with reflex HPV DNA testing, a strategy of repeat cervical cytology or delayed HPV testing costs more but is less effective. When all strategies were compared simultaneously, varying frequency and type of cytological test, biennial (vs every 3 years) liquid-based cytology with reflex HPV testing had a cost of $174 200 per YLS. In a similar comparison, liquid-based cytology with reflex HPV testing conducted every 3 years (vs every 5 years) had a cost of $59 600 per YLS and was more effective and less costly than a strategy of conventional cytology incorporating repeat cytology or immediate colposcopy conducted biennially. Reflex HPV DNA testing provides the same or greater life expectancy benefits and is more cost-effective than other management strategies for women diagnosed as having ASC-US.",Another computer-based model evaluated different triage strategies for atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance Pap smears and found that reflex HPV testing provides the same or greater life expectancy benefits and is more cost-effective. This strategy requires the use of liquid-based cytology.
"What is the recommended workup for a man with a first urinary tract infection
To investigate the prevalence and clinical importance of urological abnormalities in men with community-acquired febrile urinary tract infection (UTI). In this prospective study, 85 men (median age 63 years, range 18--86) were followed for 1 year after an episode of febrile UTI. They were investigated by excretory urography, cysto-urethroscopy, uroflowmetry, digital rectal examination and measurement of postvoid residual urine volume by abdominal ultrasonography. The radiological examination of the upper urinary tract in 83 patients revealed 22 abnormal findings in 19 men. Relevant clinical abnormalities leading to surgical intervention were found in only one patient who had renal calyceal stones. The lower urinary tract investigation disclosed 46 findings in 35 men. In all, surgically correctable disorders were found in 20 patients, of whom 15 had previously unrecognized abnormalities. All patients who required surgery were identified either by a history of voiding difficulties, acute urinary retention at the time of infection, the presence of microscopic haematuria at follow-up after one month, or early recurrent symptomatic UTI. Routine imaging studies of the upper urinary tract seem dispensable in men with febrile UTI. To reveal abnormalities of clinical importance, any urological evaluation should primarily be focused on the lower urinary tract.","A small prospective study of 85 men, 18 to 86 years of age, with febrile UTI, concluded that routine imaging of the upper urinary tract was unnecessary, and that, if indicated, further workup should focus on the lower urinary tract. Abnormalities in this group were suggested by a history of voiding problems, hematuria, or recurrent infection. One limitation of this study was the incomplete urodynamic and endoscopic evaluation of the lower urinary tract."
"What is the best way to distinguish type 1 and 2 diabetes
The incidence of pediatric type 2 diabetes has recently seen an alarming increase. To improve our understanding of pediatric type 2 diabetes and identify markers that discriminate these subjects from those with type 1 diabetes, we performed a multivariant analysis associating serum adiponectin and leptin levels with anthropometrical parameters and disease state. Samples from children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes (n = 41) and type 2 diabetes (n = 17) and from nondiabetic individuals of similar age from the general population (n = 43) were investigated. An analysis included the parameters of matching for BMI and Tanner stage. Receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curves were established to assess these analytes' association with disease. Contrary to studies of adult type 1 diabetes, adiponectin levels in our pediatric type 1 diabetic subjects (10.2 microg/ml [95% CI 8.6-11.7]) did not differ from those of healthy control subjects (10.6 microg/ml [9.2-12.0]; P = NS). Children with type 2 diabetes (5.5 microg/ml [4.8-6.2]) had significantly lower adiponectin levels than both of those groups. Conversely, type 2 diabetic subjects showed marked elevations in serum leptin concentrations (24.3 ng/ml [17.1-31.5]) compared with healthy control subjects (2.7 ng/ml [1.3-4.1]; P < 0.001) and type 1 diabetic subjects (5.1 ng/ml [3.5-6.7]; P < 0.001). Importantly, each of the properties ascribed to pediatric type 2 diabetes was present when the comparison was restricted to healthy children or type 1 diabetic patients whose BMI was >85th percentile or who had Tanner stage 4 and 5. The evaluation of adiponectin-to-leptin ratios revealed a striking difference between children with type 1 diabetes (6.3 [3.8-8.8]) and type 2 diabetes (0.3 [0.2-0.5]; P < 0.001). In pediatric diabetes, where diagnosis of disease is often difficult, these studies suggest that the adiponectin-to-leptin ratio may provide additional help in the discrimination between type 1 and type 2 diabetes.","The ratio of adiponectin to leptin hormone may show diagnostic merit. Adipocytes secrete adiponectin which acts as an insulin sensitizer, antiatherogenic and anti-inflammatory agent. Obesity and type 2 phenotype correlate with lower levels of adiponectin, but are associated with higher levels of leptin hormone, another molecule secreted by adipocytes. A recent case-control study of children aged 6 to 21 years analyzed adiponectin and leptin hormone levels in patients with classical type 1 and 2 diabetes, as determined by 2 pediatric endocrinologists; interestingly, 29% of the type 1 patients were autoantibody negative. After plotting a receiver-operating characteristic curve, they found the area under the curve was 0.97 (95% CI, 0.93-1.00). At an adiponectin-to-leptin ratio cutoff less than 0.7, they found the sensitivity to diagnose type 2 was 88% (95% CI, 64-99%), the specificity was 90% (95% CI, 77-97), and the likelihood ratio for a positive test was 8.8."
"Does warfarin prevent deep venous thrombosis in high-risk patients
Warfarin is very effective in preventing recurrent venous thromboembolism but is also associated with a substantial risk of bleeding. After three months of conventional warfarin therapy, a lower dose of anticoagulant medication may result in less bleeding and still prevent recurrent venous thromboembolism. We conducted a randomized, double-blind study, in which 738 patients who had completed three or more months of warfarin therapy for unprovoked venous thromboembolism were randomly assigned to continue warfarin therapy with a target international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.0 to 3.0 (conventional intensity) or a target INR of 1.5 to 1.9 (low intensity). Patients were followed for an average of 2.4 years. Of 369 patients assigned to low-intensity therapy, 16 had recurrent venous thromboembolism (1.9 per 100 person-years), as compared with 6 of 369 assigned to conventional-intensity therapy (0.7 per 100 person-years; hazard ratio, 2.8; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.1 to 7.0). A major bleeding episode occurred in nine patients assigned to low-intensity therapy (1.1 events per 100 person-years) and eight patients assigned to conventional-intensity therapy (0.9 event per 100 person-years; hazard ratio, 1.2; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.4 to 3.0). There was no significant difference in the frequency of overall bleeding between the two groups (hazard ratio, 1.3; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.8 to 2.1). Conventional-intensity warfarin therapy is more effective than low-intensity warfarin therapy for the long-term prevention of recurrent venous thromboembolism. The low-intensity warfarin regimen does not reduce the risk of clinically important bleeding.","A double-blind randomized controlled trial of 738 patients demonstrated that conventional-intensity warfarin therapy INR=2.0-3.0 was more effective than low-intensity therapy INR=1.5-1.9 in prevention of recurrent DVT. There were 1.9 vs 0.7 DVTs per 100 person-years in the low-intensity vs conventional-intensity therapy groups hazard ratio=2.8; 95% CI, 1.1-7.0; number needed to treat [NNT]=37. No significant difference was seen in the frequency of bleeding complications between the groups. This and other studies suggest that low-intensity warfarin therapy reduces the relative risk of thrombosis by about 75%, and conventional-intensity therapy reduces this risk by over 90%."
"What is the best way to evaluate secondary infertility
To investigate the impact of the postcoital test on the pregnancy rate among subfertile couples and on the number of other diagnostic tests and treatments. Randomised controlled study. A university and two non-university teaching hospitals in the Netherlands. New couples at infertility clinics, 1 March 1993 to 1 October 1995; randomisation to an intervention group (series of infertility investigations that include the postcoital test) or to a control group (series excluding the test). Cumulative pregnancy rate. Of 736 consecutive new couples, 444 fulfilled the inclusion criteria and consented to participate (intervention group, 227; control group, 217). Treatment was given more often in the intervention group than in the control group (54% v 41%; difference 13% (95% confidence interval 4% to 22%)). Yet cumulative pregnancy rates at 24 months in the intervention group (49% (42% to 55%)) and the control group (48% (42% to 55%)) were closely similar (difference 1% (-9.0% to 9.0%)). Routine use of the postcoital test in infertility investigations leads to more tests and treatments but has no significant effect on the pregnancy rate.",A randomized controlled trial compared 227 couples who received the postcoital test with 217 couples who did not. Routine use of the postcoital test led to more tests and more treatments but had no significant effect on the pregnancy rate.
"What is the best test to diagnose urinary tract stones
To compare nonenhanced helical computed tomography (CT) with ultrasonography (US) for the depiction of urolithiasis. During 9 months, 45 patients (mean age, 44 years; mean weight, 92.5 kg) prospectively underwent both nonenhanced helical CT (5-mm collimation; pitch of 1.5) and US of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder. US evaluation included a careful search for ureteral calculi. Presence of calculi and obstruction and incidental diagnoses were recorded. Clinical, surgical, and/or imaging follow-up data were obtained in all patients. The McNemar test was used to compare groups. Diagnoses included 23 ureteral calculi and one each of renal cell carcinoma, appendicitis, ureteropelvic junction obstruction, renal subcapsular hematoma, cholelithiasis, medullary calcinosis, and myelolipoma. CT depicted 22 of 23 ureteral calculi (sensitivity, 96%). US depicted 14 of 23 ureteral calculi (sensitivity, 61%). Differences in sensitivity were statistically significant (P: =.02). Specificity for each technique was 100%. When modalities were compared for the detection of any clinically relevant abnormality (eg, unilateral hydronephrosis and/or urolithiasis in patients with an obstructing calculus), sensitivities of US and CT increased to 92% and 100%, respectively. One case of appendicitis was missed at US, whereas medullary calcinosis and myelolipoma were missed at CT. Nonenhanced CT has a higher sensitivity for the detection of ureteral calculi compared with US.",The accuracy of ultrasonography appears to fall somewhere in between hematuria testing and IVP.
"What is the best management for patients with evidence of asymptomatic ischemia on exercise stress testing
We investigated the prognostic significance of exercise-induced silent myocardial ischemia in both high and low risk men with no prior coronary heart disease (CHD). Silent ischemia predicts future coronary events in patients with CHD, but there is little evidence of its prognostic significance in subjects free of CHD. We investigated the association of silent ischemia, as defined by ST depression during and after maximal symptom-limited exercise test, with coronary risk in a population-based sample of men with no prior CHD followed for 10 years on average. Silent ischemia during exercise was associated with a 5.9-fold (95% CI 2.3 to 11.8) CHD mortality in smokers, 3.8-fold (95% CI 1.9 to 7.9) in hypercholesterolemic men and 4.7-fold (95% CI 2.4 to 9.1) in hypertensive men adjusting for other risk factors. The respective relative risks (RRs) of any acute coronary event were 3.0 (95% CI 1.7 to 5.1), 1.9 (95% CI 1.2 to 3.1) and 2.2 (95% CI 1.4 to 3.5). These associations were weaker in men without these risk factors. Furthermore, silent ischemia after exercise was a stronger predictor for the risk of acute coronary events and CHD death in smokers and in hypercholesterolemic and hypertensive men than in men without risk factors. Exercise-induced silent myocardial ischemia was a strong predictor of CHD in men with any conventional risk factor, emphasizing the importance of exercise testing to identify asymptomatic high risk men who could benefit from risk reduction and preventive measures.","Investigators found increased mortality from coronary artery disease to be associated with smoking (relative risk [RR]=5.0 [95% CI, 2.1-11.9]), hypercholesterolemia (RR=7.6 [95% CI, 3.0-19.5]) and hypertension (RR=6.7 [95% CI, 2.9-16.0])."
"What is the recommended workup for a man with a first urinary tract infection
To determine in a prospective study whether urinary tract infection (UTI) in men younger than 45 years of age is associated with anomalies of the genitourinary tract that necessitate additional urologic evaluation. UTI in young men is uncommon. In these patients, it is customary to follow the same policy as that for children or older men and to routinely perform urologic investigations. Twenty-nine consecutive, otherwise healthy, male patients aged 16 to 45 years (mean 30.5) were hospitalized for a first event of acute UTI. All patients underwent an imaging evaluation, including ultrasonography and intravenous urography. Those with macroscopic hematuria underwent cystoscopy. Uroflowmetry was performed at least 1 month after recovery, and patients with a maximal flow rate of less than 15 mL/s underwent a pressure flow study. Significant urethral stricture was excluded in all patients. Twenty-seven patients (93%) had a postvoid residual urine volume of less than 20 mL, and only two had values of 120 and 200 mL. The imaging and cystoscopic evaluation demonstrated a normal urinary tract in all patients. The maximal urinary flow rate was greater than 15 mL/s in 22 patients (76%) and lower than 15 mL/s in 7 patients (24%). In the latter group, urodynamic investigations, including free flowmetry and/or pressure flow study, revealed normal lower urinary tract function in 6 patients and a bladder outflow obstruction in 1 (3%). A first event of UTI in men younger than 45 years is usually not associated with significant structural or functional urinary tract abnormalities. Therefore, no radiologic, endoscopic, or urodynamic investigation is required.","A very small prospective study of 29 heterosexual, circumcised men 16 to 45 years old (those who were sexually active had a steady partner) who were hospitalized with a first febrile urinary tract infection failed to find any significant structural or functional urinary tract abnormalities."
"What is the best approach to a solitary pulmonary nodule identified by chest x-ray
Positron emission tomography (PET) with 18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is a potentially useful but expensive test to diagnose solitary pulmonary nodules. To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of strategies for pulmonary nodule diagnosis and to specifically compare strategies that did and did not include FDG-PET. Decision model. Accuracy and complications of diagnostic tests were estimated by using meta-analysis and literature review. Modeled survival was based on data from a large tumor registry. Cost estimates were derived from Medicare reimbursement and other sources. All adult patients with a new, noncalcified pulmonary nodule seen on chest radiograph. Patient lifetime. Societal. 40 clinically plausible combinations of 5 diagnostic interventions, including computed tomography, FDG-PET, transthoracic needle biopsy, surgery, and watchful waiting. Costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. The cost-effectiveness of strategies depended critically on the pretest probability of malignancy. For patients with low pretest probability (26%), strategies that used FDG-PET selectively when computed tomography results were possibly malignant cost as little as 20 000 dollars per QALY gained. For patients with high pretest probability (79%), strategies that used FDG-PET selectively when computed tomography results were benign cost as little as 16 000 dollars per QALY gained. For patients with intermediate pretest probability (55%), FDG-PET strategies cost more than 220 000 dollars per QALY gained because they were more costly but only marginally more effective than computed tomography-based strategies. The choice of strategy also depended on the risk for surgical complications, the probability of nondiagnostic needle biopsy, the sensitivity of computed tomography, and patient preferences for time spent in watchful waiting. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis, FDG-PET strategies were cost saving or cost less than 100 000 dollars per QALY gained in 76.7%, 24.4%, and 99.9% of computer simulations for patients with low, intermediate, and high pretest probability, respectively. FDG-PET should be used selectively when pretest probability and computed tomography findings are discordant or in patients with intermediate pretest probability who are at high risk for surgical complications. In most other circumstances, computed tomography-based strategies result in similar quality-adjusted life-years and lower costs.","A solitary pulmonary nodule, or ""coin lesion"", is an intraparenchymal finding on chest radiograph or computerized tomography that is less than 3 to 4 cm in diameter and not associated with atelectasis or adenopathy. Malignancy rates range from 15% to 75%, depending on the population studied."

Treatment effect was evaluated using the status of thrombophlebitis, the thrombophlebitic area, pain intensity with a visual analogue scale, and side effects were registered. Both in the treatment groups and the placebo group there was a significant decrease of signs and symptoms during the treatment period. There was no statistical difference between the treatment groups and no difference between spontaneous and infusion thrombophlebitis.","An underpowered double-blind trial of topical heparin, piroxicam gel, and placebo (22 to 24 patients in each treatment arm) failed to find efficacy with either therapy."
"What is the appropriate use of sunscreen for infants and children
The use of sunscreens on the skin can prevent sunburn but whether long-term use can prevent skin cancer is not known. Also, there is evidence that oral betacarotene supplementation lowers skin-cancer rates in animals, but there is limited evidence of its effect in human beings. In a community-based randomised trial with a 2 by 2 factorial design, individuals were assigned to four treatment groups: daily application of a sun protection factor 15-plus sunscreen to the head, neck, arms, and hands, and betacarotene supplementation (30 mg per day); sunscreen plus placebo tablets; betacarotene only; or placebo only. Participants were 1621 residents of Nambour in southeast Queensland, Australia. The endpoints after 4.5 years of follow-up were the incidence of basal-cell and squamous-cell carcinomas both in terms of people treated for newly diagnosed disease and in terms of the numbers of tumours that occurred. Analysis of the effect of sunscreen was based only on skin cancers that developed on sites of daily application. All analyses were by intention to treat. 1383 participants underwent full skin examination by a dermatologist in the follow-up period. 250 of them developed 758 new skin cancers during the follow-up period. There were no significant differences in the incidence of first new skin cancers between groups randomly assigned daily sunscreen and no daily sunscreen (basal-cell carcinoma 2588 vs 2509 per 100,000; rate ratio 1.03 [95% CI 0.73-1.46]; squamous-cell carcinoma 876 vs 996 per 100,000; rate ratio 0.88 [0.50-1.56]). Similarly, there was no significant difference between the betacarotene and placebo groups in incidence of either cancer (basal-cell carcinoma 3954 vs 3806 per 100,000; 1.04 [0.73-1.27]; squamous-cell carcinoma 1508 vs 1146 per 100,000; 1.35 [0.84-2.19]). In terms of the number of tumours, there was no effect on incidence of basal-cell carcinoma by sunscreen use or by betacarotene but the incidence of squamous-cell carcinoma was significantly lower in the sunscreen group than in the no daily sunscreen group (1115 vs 1832 per 100,000; 0.61 [0.46-0.81]). There was no harmful effect of daily use of sunscreen in this medium-term study. Cutaneous squamous-cell carcinoma, but not basal-cell carcinoma seems to be amenable to prevention through the routine use of sunscreen by adults for 4.5 years. There was no beneficial or harmful effect on the rates of either type of skin cancer, as a result of betacarotene supplementation.",A randomized controlled trial in adults supports that daily sunscreen use reduces the risk of squamous cell carcinoma but not basal cell carcinoma (number needed to treat=884 for 4.5 years).
"What are the most practical primary care screens for post-traumatic stress disorder
The posttraumatic diagnostic scale (PDS) is a self-report instrument for PTSD that is simple to administer and has demonstrated good psychometric properties. We compared the PDS with the gold standard clinician administered PTSD scale (CAPS) diagnostic interview for PTSD. We assessed 138 women who were victims of domestic violence using both the PDS and the CAPS. Findings confirmed that PTSD develops at a high base rate in this sample. The PDS generally performed well in relation to the CAPS although with a tendency to overdiagnose PTSD. The findings lend further support to the use of the PDS as a diagnostic tool for PTSD but indicate that it is better at identifying survivors with PTSD than those without the disorder.","The clinician administered ptsd scale and the civilian version of the PTSD Symptom Checklist (PCL-C), both with 17 items, are widely used as ""screens"" for PTSD. However, their length and the recommendation that they be administered by a mental health professional make them cumbersome and impractical for use in primary care."
"What effect do inhaled steroids have on delaying the progression of COPD
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a syndrome of chronic progressive airflow limitation which occurs as a result of chronic inflammation of the airways and lung parenchyma. However, the role of inhaled corticosteroids in the treatment of COPD is controversial. We hypothesised that inhaled corticosteroids reduce the progression of airflow limitation in COPD. A comprehensive literature search was conducted and data were analysed using random effects methodology. The effect of inhaled steroids on annual change in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) was determined for all trials, for trials with high dose treatment regimens, and for trials in subjects with moderate to severe airflow limitation. Data from eight controlled clinical trials of > or =2 years were included (n=3715 subjects). Meta-analysis of all study data revealed that inhaled corticosteroids reduce the rate of FEV1 decline by 7.7 ml/year (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.3 to 14.2, p=0.02). Meta-analysis of studies with high dose regimens revealed a greater effect of 9.9 ml/year (95% CI 2.3 to 17.5, p=0.01) compared with the meta-analysis of all studies. Inhaled corticosteroid treatment for > or =2 years slows the rate of lung function decline in COPD. The effect observed with high dose regimens is greater than that with all regimens combined. These data suggest a potential role for inhaled corticosteroids in modifying the long term natural history of COPD.","One meta-analysis evaluated 8 controlled clinical trials lasting at least 2 years (n=3715) and found that, when compared with placebo, inhaled glucocorticosteroids significantly reduced the rate of FEV1 decline by 7.7 mL/year (P=.02) and that high-dose inhaled glucocorticosteroids had a greater effect of 9.9 mL/year (P=.01)."
"What is the best strategy for impaired glucose tolerance in nonpregnant adults
Type 2 diabetes frequently results from progressive failure of pancreatic beta-cell function in the presence of chronic insulin resistance. We tested whether chronic amelioration of insulin resistance would preserve pancreatic beta-cell function and delay or prevent the onset of type 2 diabetes in high-risk Hispanic women. Women with previous gestational diabetes were randomized to placebo (n = 133) or the insulin-sensitizing drug troglitazone (400 mg/day; n = 133) administered in double-blind fashion. Fasting plasma glucose was measured every 3 months, and oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs) were performed annually to detect diabetes. Intravenous glucose tolerance tests (IVGTTs) were performed at baseline and 3 months later to identify early metabolic changes associated with any protection from diabetes. Women who did not develop diabetes during the trial returned for OGTTs and IVGTTs 8 months after study medications were stopped. During a median follow-up of 30 months on blinded medication, average annual diabetes incidence rates in the 236 women who returned for at least one follow-up visit were 12.1 and 5.4% in women assigned to placebo and troglitazone, respectively (P < 0.01). Protection from diabetes in the troglitazone group 1) was closely related to the degree of reduction in endogenous insulin requirements 3 months after randomization, 2) persisted 8 months after study medications were stopped, and 3) was associated with preservation of beta-cell compensation for insulin resistance. Treatment with troglitazone delayed or prevented the onset of type 2 diabetes in high-risk Hispanic women. The protective effect was associated with the preservation of pancreatic beta-cell function and appeared to be mediated by a reduction in the secretory demands placed on beta-cells by chronic insulin resistance.","In the TRIPOD study, troglitazone use was associated with a 17% absolute risk reduction in the incidence of diabetes in high-risk Hispanic women (NNT=6 over an average of 30 months). The preventive effect of the drug was maintained more than 8 months after troglitazone therapy was discontinued (due to withdrawal from the US market).

To assess the evidence from controlled trials on the efficacy and tolerability of parenteral metoclopramide for acute migraine in adults. Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Medline, Embase, LILACS, CINAHL, conference proceedings, clinical practice guidelines, and other sources. Randomised controlled trials of parenteral metoclopramide for acute migraine in adults. We reviewed 596 potentially relevant abstracts and found 13 eligible trials totalling 655 adults. In studies comparing metoclopramide with placebo, metoclopramide was more likely to provide significant reduction in migraine pain (odds ratio 2.84, 95% confidence interval 1.05 to 7.68). Used as the only agent, metoclopramide showed mixed effectiveness when compared with other single agents. Heterogeneity of studies for combination treatment prevented statistical pooling. Treatments that did include metoclopramide were as, or more, effective than comparison treatments for pain, nausea, and relapse outcomes reported in all studies. Metoclopramide is an effective treatment for migraine headache and may be effective when combined with other treatments. Given its non-narcotic and antiemetic properties, metoclopramide should be considered a primary agent in the treatment of acute migraines in emergency departments.","When compared with other antiemetics (chlorpromazine [Thorazine] and prochlorperazine [Compazine]), metoclopramide was either less effective (OR=0.39; 95% CI, 0.18-0.87) or no different (OR=0.64; 95% CI, 0.23-1.76) than other therapies for reducing migraine pain."
"What gastrointestinal stress ulcer prophylaxis should we provide hospitalized patients
The implications of recent studies for guidelines that pertain to stress ulcer prophylaxis in the postoperative period are discussed. The therapeutic guidelines on stress ulcer prophylaxis published by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP) provided clinicians with recommendations regarding appropriate candidates for stress ulcer prophylaxis and selection of a pharmacologic agent. Since these guidelines were published in 1999, additional research has been completed to resolve some of the controversial issues surrounding stress ulcer prophylaxis. The frequency of stress-induced bleeding in recent investigations continues to be highly variable, depending on the definition used to describe bleeding. In general, investigations that evaluate overt bleeding or bleeding without hemodynamic changes or blood transfusion report higher frequencies of bleeding than those that evaluate clinically important bleeding. Similar to that reported in the initial ASHP guidelines, the frequency of clinically important bleeding in recent investigations is low. In addition, the majority of recently published prospective studies and a meta-analysis have been unable to demonstrate a reduction in clinically important bleeding with pharmacologic agents. As a result, some experts have suggested that advances in critical care are more influential in the development of stress-induced bleeding than the use of pharmacologic agents. Recently published investigations support the effectiveness of institution-specific guidelines to help clinicians identify appropriate candidates for stress ulcer prophylaxis. The selection of an optimal pharmacologic agent for stress ulcer prophylaxis continues to be debated. The majority of recent studies have involved the administration of proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs). In general, these studies have demonstrated that PPIs are at least as effective as histamine H2-receptor antagonists at increasing gastric pH, but adequately powered studies investigating the endpoint of clinically important bleeding are needed. Similar to the initial ASHP guidelines, the development of institution-specific guidelines is recommended to identify the most appropriate pharmacologic treatment. The frequency of clinically important bleeding reported in recent studies is low. The majority of recently published prospective studies and meta-analyses found little significant reduction in bleeding with pharmacologic prophylaxis.","Since then, improvements in ICU management have decreased this incidence to 0% to 2.8%."
"Menstrual disturbances in perimenopausal women: What's best
To assess clinical status, changes in health related quality of life, and subsequent management five years after medical management or transcervical resection of the endometrium for treatment of heavy menstrual loss. Five year follow up using postal questionnaires and operative databank review. Gynaecology department of a large UK teaching hospital. Women referred to the gynaecologist for treatment of heavy menstrual loss. Eligible women, without a treatment preference, were randomised equally to either medical treatment or transcervical resection of the endometrium. Women's satisfaction with treatment, menstrual status, changes in health related quality of life, and additional treatments received at five years. One hundred and forty-four patients completed questionnaires, achieving 77% follow up (medical n = 71/94; transcervical resection of the endometrium n = 73/93). At five-year follow up, 7/71 (10%) of those randomised to the medical arm still used medical treatment, while 72/94 (77%) had undergone surgical treatment and 17/94 (18%) a hysterectomy. Twenty-five (27%) women allocated to transcervical resection of the endometrium had undergone further surgery, 18/93 (19%) a hysterectomy. At five years women initially randomised to medical treatment were significantly less likely to be totally satisfied (P < 0.01, difference 21%, 95% CI -37% to -4%), or to recommend their allocated treatment to a friend (P < 0.001, difference 59%, 95% CI -73% to -45%). Bleeding and pain scores were similar in both groups and highly significantly reduced. Significantly more women in the transcervical resection of the endometrium arm had no bleeding or very light bleeding (P < 0.02, difference -22%, CI -31% to -4%), and they had significantly less days heavy bleeding (P < 0.02). Short Form 36 health survey scores were significantly improved from baseline for all eight health scales in the transcervical resection of the endometrium arm, and four in the medical arm. A policy of immediate transcervical resection of the endometrium for women referred to a gynaecologist for treatment of heavy menstrual loss achieves higher levels of satisfaction, better menstrual status, and greater improvements in health related quality of life than medical treatment. In addition, transcervical resection of the endometrium is safe and does not lead to an increase in the number of hysterectomies. An effective endometrial ablative technique should be offered to all eligible women seeking treatment of their heavy menses from a gynaecologist.","An randomized controlled trials of 187 women, average age 42 years, compared immediate transcervical resection of the endometrium to medical management for heavy menstrual bleeding. A 5-year follow-up was completed on 144 patients. The study showed transcervical resection of the endometrium to be superior with regard to menstrual status (less bleeding or no bleeding), patient satisfaction with outcomes, and health-related quality of life as indicated on patient questionnaires."
"What's the best drug treatment for premature ejaculation
Premature ejaculation (PE) is the most common ejaculatory dysfunction. We assessed the efficacy of sildenafil to increase the time to ejaculation, improve ejaculatory control, and decrease the postejaculatory erectile refractory time in men with PE. The main study was an 8-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study in men between 18 and 65 years of age with diagnosed PE. A substudy was also conducted using a subset of patients (two-way crossover, one center) before entry to the main study. The primary study measured intravaginal ejaculatory latency (IELT) and responses to the Index of Premature Ejaculation (IPE) questionnaire. The substudy measured vibrotactile stimulation ejaculatory latency time (VTS-ELT) and postejaculatory erectile refractory time. Differences between treatment groups were determined by ancova at the 5% level of significance. The change in IELT (1.6 +/- 6.08 vs. 0.6 +/- 2.07 minutes) and VTS-ELT (2.9 +/- 0.4 vs. 2.4 +/- 0.4 minutes) were higher after taking sildenafil, compared with placebo, but did not reach statistical significance. However, patients who took sildenafil (vs. placebo) reported significantly (P < 0.05) increased ejaculatory control (1.8 +/- 0.3 vs. 1.5 +/- 0.3), increased ejaculatory confidence (2.2 +/- 0.2 vs. 1.9 +/- 0.2), and improved overall sexual satisfaction scores (3.1 +/- 0.2 vs. 2.8 +/- 02) on the IPE, and had a decreased postejaculatory erectile refractory time (3.2 +/- 0.7 vs. 6.4 +/- 0.7 minutes). The most common adverse events for sildenafil (vs. placebo) were headache (15% vs. 1%), flushing (15% vs. 0%), dyspepsia (5% vs. 1%), abnormal vision (5% vs. 0%), and rhinitis (5% vs. 0%). Although IELT and VTS-ELT were not significantly improved, sildenafil increased confidence, the perception of ejaculatory control, and overall sexual satisfaction, and decreased the refractory time to achieve a second erection after ejaculation in men with PE.","One randomized controlled trials found no increase in IELT from baseline in men taking sildenafil when compared with placebo, although patients reported overall sexual satisfaction and confidence based on a questionnaire."
"Should you treat a symptomatic patient by phone when his child has confirmed strep throat
Sore throat is a common complaint, and identifying patients with group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis (strep throat) is an important task for clinicians. Previous reviews have not systematically reviewed and synthesized the evidence. To review the precision and accuracy of the clinical examination in diagnosing strep throat. MEDLINE search for articles about diagnosis of strep throat using history-taking and physical examination. Large blinded, prospective studies (having > or =300 patients with sore throat) reporting history and physical examination data and using throat culture as the reference standard were included. Of 917 articles identified by the search, 9 met all inclusion criteria. Pairs of authors independently reviewed each article and used consensus to resolve discrepancies. The most useful findings for evaluating the likelihood of strep throat are presence of tonsillar exudate, pharyngeal exudate, or exposure to strep throat infection in the previous 2 weeks (positive likelihood ratios, 3.4, 2.1, and 1.9, respectively) and the absence of tender anterior cervical nodes, tonsillar enlargement, or exudate (negative likelihood ratios, 0.60, 0.63, and 0.74, respectively). No individual element of history-taking or physical examination is accurate enough by itself to rule in or rule out strep throat. Three validated clinical prediction rules are described for adult and pediatric populations. While no single element of history-taking or physical examination is sufficiently accurate to exclude or diagnose strep throat, a well-validated clinical prediction rule can be useful and can help physicians make more informed use of rapid antigen tests and throat cultures.","Only 5% to 10% of adults and 20% to 25% of children presenting in an office setting with acute pharyngitis actually have group a beta-hemolytic streptococci pharyngitis. The prevalence of group a beta-hemolytic streptococci pharyngitis is higher for patients presenting to urgent care centers or emergency rooms than office practices. Of the primary clinical prediction rules for pharyngitis, only the Walsh Diagnostic Algorithm explicitly includes a history of streptococcal exposure. In that algorithm, only patients with tender or enlarged cervical lymph nodes who either had exudative pharyngitis or a recent exposure were in the highest risk category (23% prevalence of GABHS)."
"How should we treat major depression combined with anxiety
The aim of this study was to determine both the clinical and cost-effectiveness of usual general practitioner (GP) care compared with two types of brief psychological therapy (non-directive counselling and cognitive-behaviour therapy) in the management of depression as well as mixed anxiety and depression in the primary care setting. The design was principally a pragmatic randomised controlled trial, but was accompanied by two additional allocation methods allowing patient preference: the option of a specific choice of treatment (preference allocation) and the option to be randomised between the psychological therapies only. Of the 464 patients allocated to the three treatments, 197 were randomised between the three treatments, 137 chose a specific treatment, and 130 were randomised between the psychological therapies only. The patients underwent follow-up assessments at 4 and 12 months. The study was conducted in 24 general practices in Greater Manchester and London. A total of 464 eligible patients, aged 18 years and over, were referred by 73 GPs and allocated to one of the psychological therapies or usual GP care for depressive symptoms. The interventions consisted of brief psychological therapy (12 sessions maximum) or usual GP care. Non-directive counselling was provided by counsellors who were qualified for accreditation by the British Association for Counselling. Cognitive-behaviour therapy was provided by clinical psychologists who were qualified for accreditation by the British Association for Behavioural and Cognitive Psychotherapies. Usual GP care included discussions with patients and the prescription of medication, but GPs were asked to refrain from referring patients for psychological intervention for at least 4 months. Most therapy sessions took place on a weekly basis in the general practices. By the 12-month follow-up, GP care in some cases did include referral to mental healthcare specialists. The clinical outcomes included depressive symptoms, general psychiatric symptoms, social function and patient satisfaction. The economic outcomes included direct and indirect costs and quality of life. Assessments were carried out at baseline during face-to-face interviews as well as at 4 and 12 months in person or by post. At 4 months, both psychological therapies had reduced depressive symptoms to a significantly greater extent than usual GP care. Patients in the psychological therapy groups exhibited mean scores on the Beck Depression Inventory that were 4-5 points lower than the mean score of patients in the usual GP care group, a difference that was also clinically significant. These differences did not generalize to other measures of outcome. There was no significant difference in outcome between the two psychological therapies when they were compared directly using all 260 patients randomised to a psychological therapy by either randomised allocation method. At 12 months, the patients in all three groups had improved to the same extent. The lack of a significant difference between the treatment groups at this point resulted from greater improvement of the patients in the GP care group between the 4- and 12-month follow-ups. At 4 months, patients in both psychological therapy groups were more satisfied with their treatment than those in the usual GP care group. However, by 12 months, patients who had received non-directive counselling were more satisfied than those in either of the other two groups. There were few differences in the baseline characteristics of patients who were randomised or expressed a treatment preference, and no differences in outcome between these patients. Similar outcomes were found for patients who chose either psychological therapy. Again, there were no significant differences between the two groups at 4 or 12 months. Patients who chose counselling were more satisfied with treatment than those who chose c","Another trial assigned primary care patients (N=464) with depression or mixed depression and anxiety to 1 of 2 psychological therapy groups (cognitive behavioral therapy or non-directive counseling for 12 sessions) vs usual general practitioner care. At 4 months, both psychological therapy groups had lower Beck Depression Index scores (by 4-5 points) than the usual general practitioner care group, but by 12 months there were no significant differences among all groups."
"What is the best treatment for chronic constipation in the elderly
To evaluate the efficacy of a recently developed device that applies kneading-like motion on the abdomen in improving constipation in elderly long-term care patients. Thirty constipated elderly patients were randomly selected from two nursing homes. They were instructed to use the device once daily for 20 min. Rate of bowel movements, volume and consistency of stool and the use of laxantia were all recorded during a 3-wk baseline period and for 12-wk treatment period. Colonic transit time (CTT) was measured in 13 patients by radiopaque markers during the baseline and at the end of treatment. Bowel movement rate (BM/week) increased from 1.4+/-0.4 BM/wk during baseline to 3.9+/-0.8 BM/wk during treatment (P<5.0x10(-7)). Stool amount that was ""low"" in 30 patients during baseline increased in 21 patients at the end of the study period (chi2 = 19.048-P = 1.3x10(-5)). Stool consistency, that was ""hard"" in 25 patients and ""soft"" in 5 patients during baseline, ameliorated in 23 patients at the end of the study (only 2 patients referred ""hard"" stool) (chi2 = 21.043-P = 4.0x10(-6)). The mean baseline CTT measured was 92.3+/-32.3 h at baseline and decreased to 49.4+/-31.3 h during the study period (P = 0.000208). No side effects were observed during the study period. External mechanical vibration of the abdomen reduced CTT and helped to relieve severe constipation in elderly constipated patients.","One before-after cohort study investigated an external kneading mechanical device (Free-Lax) that was applied to the abdomen for 20 minutes once daily in 30 randomly selected chronically constipated nursing home residents. Researchers found significant improvements in bowel movement frequency, stool consistency and volume, and colonic transit time without side effects."
"What gastrointestinal stress ulcer prophylaxis should we provide hospitalized patients
To resolve discrepancies in previous systematic overviews and provide estimates of the effect of stress ulcer prophylaxis on gastrointestinal bleeding, pneumonia, and mortality in critically ill patients. Computerized search of published and unpublished research, bibliographies, pharmaceutical and personal files, and conference abstract reports. Independent review of 269 articles identified 63 relevant randomized trials for inclusion. We made independent, duplicate assessment of the methodologic quality, population, intervention, and outcomes of each trial. The source of discrepancies between prior meta-analyses included incomplete identification of relevant studies, differential inclusion of non-English language and nonrandomized trials, different definitions of bleeding, provision of additional information through direct correspondence with authors, and different statistical methods. The current overview demonstrates that prophylaxis with histamine2-receptor antagonists decreases the incidence of overt gastrointestinal bleeding (odds ratio [OR], 0.58; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.42 to 0.79) and clinically important bleeding (OR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.22 to 0.88). There is a trend toward decreased overt bleeding when antacids are compared with no therapy (OR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.37 to 1.17). Histamine2-receptor antagonists and antacids are associated with a trend toward lower clinically important bleeding rates than sucralfate is. There is a trend toward an increased risk of pneumonia associated with histamine2-receptor antagonists as compared with no prophylaxis (OR, 1.25; 95% CI, 0.78 to 2.00). Sucralfate is associated with a lower incidence of nosocomial pneumonia when compared with antacids (OR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.56 to 1.15) and histamine2-receptor antagonists (OR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.60 to 1.01). Sucralfate is also associated with a reduced mortality rate (OR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.54 to 0.97) relative to antacids and to histamine2-receptor antagonists (OR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.63 to 1.09). Our results emphasize the need for registries to include all randomized trials and demonstrate the importance of explicit methodology for systematic reviews. There is strong evidence of reduced clinically important gastrointestinal bleeding with histamine2-receptor antagonists. Sucralfate may be as effective in reducing bleeding as gastric pH-altering drugs and is associated with lower rates of pneumonia and mortality. However, the data are insufficient to determine the net effect of sucralfate compared with no prophylaxis.","Medications used to prevent gastrointestinal bleeding have included antacids, sucralfate, H2RAs, and PPIs. Sucralfate and H2RAs have been studied most frequently, and both agents significantly reduce the incidence of clinically important bleeding in high-risk patients. Compared with placebo, the odds ratio for clinically important bleeding was 0.44 with ranitidine (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.22-0.88) and 0.58 with sucralfate (95% CI, 0.34-0.99). In a population with a clinically important bleeding incidence of 3% to 6%, a range consistent with the most recent studies we reviewed, the number needed to treat to prevent 1 bleeding episode is 30 to 60 for ranitidine and 40 to 79 for sucralfate."
"How should we follow up a positive screen for anemia in a 1-year old
An evaluation was made of 278 healthy-appearing 1-year-old infants who were tested for iron deficiency to determine the relative frequency of adverse side effects attributable to oral iron treatment. After obtaining parental informed consent, laboratory tests of iron status were performed on venous blood and infants with hemoglobin level greater than 10.5 g/dL were randomly chosen to receive 1.2 mL of ferrous sulfate (FeSO4) drops (about 3 mg of iron per kilogram per day) or equal volume of placebo for 3 months. After 3 months of treatment, infants were to return to the clinic for repeat blood testing, compliance estimation, and evaluation for possible adverse side effects. There was no significant difference (P greater than .50) in the frequency of vomiting, diarrhea, or fussiness in iron-treated infants (6%) compared with placebo-treated infants (9%). Constipation was slightly more frequently reported (P = .03) in placebo-treated infants (9%) than in iron-treated infants (1%). Compliance with therapy was confirmed in 179 completely evaluated infants by the lack of remaining medication at 3 months, the higher incidence (P less than .0001) of dark stools reported among iron-treated infants, and the changes in laboratory tests of iron status. No parents reported dark stools as an adverse effect of therapy. It is concluded that once daily, moderate-dose FeSO4 therapy given to fasting 1-year-old infants results in no more gastrointestinal side effects than placebo therapy.","A randomized controlled trial of iron supplementation vs placebo in 278 infants testing positive for iron-deficiency anemia demonstrated that once daily, moderate-dose ferrous sulfate (FeSO4) therapy (3 mg/kg/d of elemental iron) given to fasting 1-year-old infants results in no more gastrointestinal side effects than placebo therapy."
"What are the indications for urodynamic testing in older adults with incontinence
To test the usefulness of urodynamic examination in female urinary incontinence. As part of a population-based, randomized, controlled treatment study in general practice, the control group was offered urodynamic examination before and after delayed treatment starting 6 months after inclusion in the study, i.e. after the first outcome evaluation comparing the initially treated group with the control group. The intervention group was offered urodynamic examination only after the final outcome evaluation at 12 months. Eighty-seven women, aged 50-74, from three Norwegian municipalities participated. There was no difference in treatment outcome whether the patients had urodynamic examination or not. Eleven patients (26% of 42 control patients) had their diagnosis revised after urodynamic examination, ten of them with a subsequent change in treatment. The outcome for this group was no different than for the other patients. As a subgroup, the 11 patients had more severe leakage (p = 0.048) and more previous gynecological operations (p = 0.038) than the other control group patients. Our study supports the idea that in general practice, or in rather unselected patients, women with urinary incontinence may be classified and treated without urodynamic examination. If there is little or no improvement during the first few months referral should be considered, and this should be done sooner for patients with severe incontinence or prior gynecological operations than for other patients.","A recent small randomized controlled trials (n=87) found that, of patients with previous genitourinary surgery or more severe stress incontinence, about one quarter were more likely to have their management revised after urodynamic studies. Patients who demonstrated little or no improvement during the first few months of conservative treatment also ran a higher risk of misdiagnosis. Despite these findings, no difference in treatment outcomes was detected for women randomized to urodynamic testing."
"When is neuroimaging warranted for headache
From a consecutive series of 3,847 headache patients, 1,331 patients who made first visits for new headache to 120 primary care physicians were studied for usual care over a 14-month period. Either tension or vascular headache was the initial diagnosis in 23.8 percent and 12.8 percent of patients, respectively. Nearly one half (47.8 percent) were classified as having headaches other than tension or vascular. A total of 15.3 percent of headaches were undiagnosed or were regarded as a mixture of traditional diagnostic designations. At first visit, most patients (76.6 percent) were managed without diagnostic tests. Drugs were prescribed for 73.6 percent, and advice was given for 58.6 percent. Only 2.0 percent of patients had computerized tomographic scanning ordered at first visit, although at least 46 percent met National Institutes of Health criteria, a finding with potential economic consequences of at least $2 billion. These findings suggest the need for reevaluation of diagnostic categories for headache, reevaluation of strategies for headache management, and further investigations of headache in primary care patients.","Information concerning the workup of headache in the ambulatory setting is limited. In actual practice, only about 3% of patients who present with a new headache in the office setting have neuroimaging ordered."
"Should we screen women for hypothyroidism
Treatment of hypercholesterolemia can reduce the risk of developing premature atherosclerosis. The hypercholesterolemia caused by hypothyroidism is potentially reversible by thyroid hormone replacement therapy. We determined the prevalence of hypothyroidism in patients referred to a university lipid research clinic and studied the changes in lipid and lipoprotein levels on restoration of the euthyroid state. A retrospective follow-up study was performed. In all 1509 consecutive referrals for severe dyslipidemia, thyrotropin levels were measured. Patients with hypothyroidism were identified by means of a computed database, from January 1, 1989, to July 1, 1993, first by levothyroxine sodium medication and second by serum thyrotropin values greater than 5 mU/L. Twenty-one patients were available to evaluate the effect of restoration of the euthyroid state on plasma lipid and lipoprotein levels. The observed prevalence of hypothyroidism proved to be 4.2% (64/1509). The disorder was previously known in 25 patients and newly diagnosed in 39 patients (11 with overt hypothyroidism and 28 with subclinical hypothyroidism). Significant reductions in total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels occurred only in patients with pretreatment thyrotropin values of 10 mU/L or more. The prevalence of newly diagnosed cases of overt hypothyroidism in patients referred to a lipid clinic is approximately two times that in the general population. The absence of significant reductions in total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels on levothyroxine treatment in patients with minor subclinical hypothyroidism (thyrotropin level, < 10 mU/L) does not support the view that this condition is a risk factor for atherosclerosis mediated by an elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level. All patients referred for diagnosis and treatment of dyslipidemia should be screened for hypothyroidism by measurement of thyrotropin values.","A retrospective study of 709 women referred to an endocrine clinic for evaluation of abnormal lipoprotein levels identified 34 (4.8%) with undiagnosed hypothyroidism. Thyroid hormone treatment significantly reduced total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in patients with initial thyroid-stimulating hormone >10, but not in those with a thyroid-stimulating hormone <10."
"What is the best management for patients with evidence of asymptomatic ischemia on exercise stress testing
Exercise testing is useful in the assessment of symptomatic patients for diagnosis of significant or extensive coronary disease and to predict their future risk of cardiac events. The Duke treadmill score (DTS) is a composite index that was designed to provide survival estimates based on results from the exercise test, including ST-segment depression, chest pain, and exercise duration. However, its usefulness for providing diagnostic estimates has yet to be determined. A logistic regression model was used to predict significant (>/=75% stenosis) and severe (3-vessel or left main) coronary artery disease, and a Cox regression analysis was used to predict cardiac survival. After adjustment for baseline clinical risk, the DTS was effectively diagnostic for significant (P<0.0001) and severe (P<0.0001) coronary artery disease. For low-risk patients (score >/=+5), 60% had no coronary stenosis >/=75% and 16% had single-vessel >/=75% stenosis. By comparison, 74% of high-risk patients (score <-11) had 3-vessel or left main coronary disease. Five-year mortality was 3%, 10%, and 35% for low-, moderate-, and high-risk DTS groups (P<0.0001). The composite DTS provides accurate diagnostic and prognostic information for the evaluation of symptomatic patients evaluated for clinically suspected ischemic heart disease.","A prospective cohort study confirmed that a low-risk duke treadmill exercise score was associated with high 5-year survival-eg, 97% among 2758 patients (median age 49, 70% male, 30% prior myocardial infarction, 49% with angina)."
"What is the best strategy for monitoring the lipid-lowering effects of medical therapy used for the primary prevention of coronary artery disease coronary artery disease
To assess the accuracy of lipid screening strategies to identify individuals at increased risk of coronary heart disease mortality. The 15% random sample of adults recruited into the Lipid Research Clinic Prevalence and Follow-up Studies, which included 3678 men and women aged 35 to 74 years. Total plasma cholesterol levels, lipoprotein fractions, and other coronary risk factors at study entry were compared with subsequent coronary heart disease mortality (mean follow-up, 12.2 years). The areas under receiver operating characteristic curves for blood lipids, lipid ratios, the screening guidelines proposed by the National National Cholesterol Education Program, those of the Canadian Consensus Conference on Cholesterol, and a coronary risk model that used Framingham data. The current National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines (area under the curve, 0.74) were significantly (P = .03) more accurate than the old National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines (area, 0.72). The ratio of total plasma cholesterol level to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level (area, 0.72) was as accurate as current National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines. The coronary risk model (area, 0.85) was superior (P < .003) to all other screening maneuvers. Compared with the current National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines, the risk model demonstrated superior test sensitivity (70% vs 45%) with only slightly reduced specificity (82% vs 86%). The ratio of total plasma cholesterol level to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level is as accurate as current American screening guidelines. Future guidelines should better incorporate high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and nonlipid risk factors to target high-risk individuals accurately.",Grover and colleagues found that the TC/HDL-C and the LDL-C/HDL-C ratios both performed better than the total cholesterol in predicting heart disease mortality.
"Which strategies work best to prevent obesity in adults
Although self-monitoring is a central tenet of behavioral approaches to changing health behavior, clinical and public health recommendations for better controlling body weight do not emphasize weight self-monitoring. The objective was to determine whether more frequent self-weighing exerts a positive influence on weight loss or weight gain prevention. This study examined cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between self-weighing frequency and weight in two distinct groups: 1,226 adults who were enrolled in a weight gain prevention trial, and 1,800 adults who were enrolled in a weight loss trial. Although the samples differed significantly in weight and baseline demographic characteristics, the distribution of baseline weighing frequencies did not differ by study. In both groups, more frequent self-weighing at baseline was associated with greater age, lower fat intake, White ethnicity, current nonsmoking status, a greater history of dieting to lose weight, and lower current body mass index. Despite similar weighing instructions, differential patterns of weighing frequency over time were observed: Weight loss dieters increased weighing over time regardless of treatment group (control or intervention), whereas weight gain preventers decreased weighing over time in the control group and increased weighing over time in intervention groups. Most important, higher weighing frequency was associated with greater 24-month weight loss or less weight gain. Results support the idea that daily weighing is valuable to individuals trying to lose weight or prevent weight gain. Daily self-weighing should be emphasized in clinical and public health messages about weight control. Experimental studies on the effects of weighing frequency in these contexts are recommended.","An RCT, found an association between self-weighing and preventing weight gain. Patients who weighed themselves daily or weekly were less likely to gain weight than patients who weighed themselves monthly, yearly, or never."
"What's the best way to treat Achilles tendonopathy
Injuries involving the Achilles tendon and manifested as chronic tendon pain are common, especially among recreational athletes. In a pilot study on a small group of patients with chronic painful mid-portion Achilles tendinosis, eccentric calf-muscle training was shown to give good clinical results. The aim of this prospective study was to investigate if the previously achieved good clinical results could be reproduced in a larger group of patients, and also to investigate the effects of eccentric calf-muscle training in patients with chronic insertional Achilles tendon pain. Seventy-eight consecutive patients, having chronic painful Achilles tendinosis at the mid-portion (2-6 cm level) in a total of 101 tendons (55 unilateral and 23 bilateral), and thirty consecutive patients with chronic insertional Achilles tendon pain in 31 tendons (29 unilateral and one bilateral) were treated with eccentric calf-muscle training for 12 weeks. Most patients were recreational athletes. Evaluation of the amount of tendon pain during activity was recorded on a visual analogue scale (VAS), before and after treatment. In 90 of the 101 Achilles tendons (89%) with chronic painful mid-portion Achilles tendinosis, treatment was satisfactory and the patients were back on their pre-injury activity level after the 12-week training regimen. In these patients, the amount of pain during activity, registered on the VAS-scale (mean+/-SD), decreased significantly from 66.8+/-19.4 to 10.2+/-13.7. On the contrary, in only ten of the tendons (32%) with chronic insertional Achilles tendon pain was treatment satisfactory, with a significant decrease on the VAS-scale (mean+/-SD), from 68.3+/-7.0 to 13.3+/-13.2. Our conclusion is that treatment with eccentric calf-muscle training produced good clinical results in patients with chronic painful mid-portion Achilles tendinosis, but not in patients with chronic insertional Achilles tendon pain.","eccentric calf-muscle training is an effective intervention for chronic noninsertional Achilles tendonopathy. An observational study of eccentric calf-muscle training in 78 patients (101 tendons total) with chronic noninsertional Achilles tendonopathy found that 89% were back to their preinjury activity level after a 12-week regimen of ECMT, as indicated by significantly lower scores on a 100-point visual analog scale (67 at baseline vs 10.2 at 12 weeks; P<0.001)."
"What is the best way to treat tinea cruris
Seventy patients with tinea cruris or tinea corporis were treated with naftifine cream 1% or vehicle once daily for 4 weeks in this double-blind, randomized study. After two weeks, the patients using naftifine had a significantly higher mycologic cure rate than the vehicle-treated patients (79% vs. 31%, p less than 0.001), and they showed significantly better resolution of signs and symptoms. Statistically significantly differences favoring naftifine over its vehicle were found throughout the treatment period and 2 weeks posttreatment.",79% mycological cure were seen in a placebo-controlled trial with 70 patients using once daily naftifine 1% cream after 2 weeks of treatment (NNT=2).
"How does colonoscopy compare with fecal occult blood testing as a screening tool for colon cancer
Many expert panels recommend colorectal cancer screening for average-risk asymptomatic individuals older than 50 years of age. Recent studies have found that 24% to 64% of primary care providers use only the digital fecal occult blood test (FOBT) as their primary screening test. The effectiveness of a single digital FOBT is unknown. To compare the sensitivity and specificity of digital FOBT and the recommended 6-sample at-home FOBT for advanced neoplasia in asymptomatic persons. Prospective cohort study. 13 Veterans Affairs medical centers. 3121 asymptomatic patients 50 to 75 years of age. 2665 patients had 6-sample at-home FOBT and digital FOBT, followed by complete colonoscopy. We measured the sensitivity of digital and 6-sample FOBT for advanced neoplasia and the specificity for no neoplasia. We calculated predictive values and likelihood ratios for advanced neoplasia, defined as tubular adenomas 10 mm or greater, adenomas with villous histology or high-grade dysplasia, or invasive cancer. Of all participants, 96.8% were men; their average age was 63.1 years. The 6-sample FOBT and the single digital FOBT had specificities of 93.9% and 97.5%, respectively, as defined by studying 1656 patients with no neoplasia. Sensitivities for detection of advanced neoplasia in 284 patients were 23.9% for the 6-sample FOBT and 4.9% for the digital FOBT. The likelihood ratio for advanced neoplasia was 1.68 (95% CI, 0.96 to 2.94) for positive results on digital FOBT and 0.98 (CI, 0.95 to 1.01) for negative results. Most patients were men. Single digital FOBT is a poor screening method for colorectal neoplasia and cannot be recommended as the only test. When digital FOBT is performed as part of a primary care physical examination, negative results do not decrease the odds of advanced neoplasia. Persons with these results should be offered at-home 6-sample FOBT or another type of screening test.","The us preventive services task force review found both screening strategies cost-effective (<$30,000 per additional life-year gained) compared to no screening. fecal occult blood test had a cost per life-year saved of $5691 to $17,805 compared with $9038 to $22,012 for colonoscopy performed every 10 years."
"When should COX-2 selective NSAIDs be used for osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis
Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis. Published guidelines and expert opinion are divided over the relative role of acetaminophen (also called paracetamol or Tylenol) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) as first-line pharmacologic therapy. The comparative safety of acetaminophen and NSAIDs is important to consider as NSAIDs have the potential for serious gastrointestinal, renal, and cardiovascular toxicities, and acetaminophen in high dosages (greater than or equal to 2 grams per day), may also have the potential for serious upper gastrointestinal toxicity. To assess the efficacy and safety of acetaminophen versus placebo and versus NSAIDs (ibuprofen, arthrotec, celecoxib,naproxen, rofecoxib) for treating OA. We searched the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (Issue 3, 2002), MEDLINE (up to July 2002), and Current Contents (up to March 2002). Reference lists of identified RCTs and pertinent review articles were also hand searched. Published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the efficacy and safety of acetaminophen alone in OA were considered for inclusion. Pain, physical function and global assessment outcomes were reported. Results for continuous outcome measures were expressed as standardized mean differences. Dichotomous outcome measures were pooled using relative risk and the number needed to treat was calculated. Six RCTs and 1689 participants were included in the review. One study compared acetaminophen to placebo, and five compared acetaminophen to NSAIDs. In the placebo-controlled RCT, acetaminophen was shown to be clearly superior to placebo with a similar safety profile. The number needed to treat to achieve an improvement in pain was three. In the comparator-controlled RCTs, acetaminophen was less effective overall than NSAIDs in terms of pain reduction and global assessments but both drugs had similar efficacy in terms of improvements in functional status. No significant difference was found between the safety of acetaminophen and NSAIDs, although patients taking NSAIDS were more likely to withdraw due to GI events. The evidence to date suggests that NSAIDs are superior to acetaminophen for improving knee and hip pain in people with OA but have not been shown to be superior in improving function. The size of the treatment effect was modest, and the mean trial duration was only six weeks, therefore, additional considerations need to be factored in when making the decision between using acetaminophen or NSAIDs. In OA subjects with moderate-to-severe levels of pain, NSAIDs appear to be more effective than acetaminophen.","A Cochrane review (6 randomized controlled trials, N=1689, mean duration 5.8 weeks) assessed the efficacy and safety of acetaminophen in the management of osteoarthritis, comparing it with placebo and NSAIDs. Acetaminophen was superior to placebo in pain reduction and global assessment (number needed to treat [NNT]=2) with a similar safety profile. NSAIDs were better than acetaminophen in pain reduction, patient (NNT=6) and physician global assessment (NNT=17), but no better for functional improvement. Compared with nonselective NSAIDs, acetaminophen led to fewer withdrawals (number needed to harm [NNH]=20) and fewer gastrointestinal adverse events (NNH=9), but there was no statistical difference when compared with COX-2 selective NSAIDs."
"What's the best treatment for pyogenic granuloma
Pyogenic granuloma is a common, acquired, vascular tumor of the skin in children, often ulcerates or bleeds, and is commonly localized to the face. The treatment of choice has been surgical removal, either by excision or shave, followed by electrocautery. The site, young age of the patient, and the inherent nature of surgical removal or electrocautery often make this procedure a traumatic experience. Also, surgical treatment usually leads to permanent scarring. Owing to the pulsed dye laser's ability to cause selective destruction of superficial capillary-sized cutaneous blood vessels, its ease of operation, and its lack of scarring, we evaluated its use in the treatment of pyogenic granuloma in children. Twenty-two children with solitary pyogenic granulomas were treated with a vascular-specific (585 nm), pulsed (450 microseconds) dye laser using a 5-mm spot size with a laser energy of 6 to 7 J/cm2 without anesthesia. Retreatments were administered every 2 weeks if necessary until the lesion cleared. Posttreatment care consisted of twice-a-day application of bacitracin ointment. In 20 patients (91%), laser treatment was successful. Five patients (25%) required one treatment for resolution, eight patients (40%) required two treatments, and six patients (30%) required three treatments for clearing. One patient required six treatments before the lesion resolved. There was no correlation with the duration, or site of the lesion, with respect to the number of laser treatments required. Lesions in all 20 children healed without scarring and with excellent cosmetic results. In two patients (9%), laser treatment failed in that there was no response to the initial laser treatment on follow-up 2 weeks later. Both had large pyogenic granulomas (1 cm and .5 cm in diameter, respectively) which were elevated over .5 cm above the surface of the skin. These lesions were surgically removed. None of the patients had a recurrence during the follow-up period of 6 months to 3 years. Pulsed dye lasers are effective and safe for the treatment of small pyogenic granulomas in children and should be considered a treatment option.",A case series of 22 patients (mean age 3.4 years; range 6 months to 16 years) treated with pulsed dye laser for mostly small lesions (average diameter 4 mm) on the face reported successful removal in 20 children in 1 to 6 treatment sessions (average 2.25) with no residual scarring. Two children with larger lesions required shave excision with cautery (scarring was not assessed).
"Prophylactic oxytocin: Before or after placental delivery
To determine the efficacy of intravenous oxytocin administration compared with intravenous methylergometrine administration for the prevention of postpartum hemorrhage (PPH), and the significance of administration at the end of the second stage of labor compared with that after the third stage. A prospective study was undertaken: two major groups (oxytocin group and methylergometrine group) of 438 women with singleton pregnancy and vaginal delivery were studied during a 15-month period. These two groups were subdivided into three subgroups: 1. intravenous injection (two minutes) group immediately after the delivery of the fetal anterior shoulder, 2. intravenous injection (two minutes) group immediately after the delivery of the placenta, and 3. drip infusion (20 min) group immediately after the delivery of the fetal head. In each group, quantitative postpartum blood loss, frequencies of blood loss >500 ml, and need of additional uterotonic treatment were evaluated. As compared with methylergometrine, oxytocin administration was associated with a significant reduction in postpartum blood loss and in frequency of blood loss >500 ml. The risk of PPH was significantly reduced with intravenous injection of oxytocin after delivery of the fetal anterior shoulder, compared with intravenous injection of oxytocin after expulsion of the placenta (OR 0.33, 95%CI 0.11-0.98) and intravenous injection of methylergometrine after delivery of the fetal anterior shoulder (OR 0.31, 95%CI 0.11-0.85). Intravenous injection of 5 IU oxytocin immediately after delivery of fetal anterior shoulder is the treatment of choice for prevention of PPH in patients with natural course of labor.","A prospective cohort study noted a significant reduction in the risk of postpartum hemorrhage when oxytocin was given after delivery of the anterior shoulder, compared with the placenta. In this study, 82 patients received 5 units of oxytocin on delivery of the anterior shoulder, and 52 received an identical dose after delivery of the placenta. The incidence of postpartum hemorrhage ≥500 mL was 7.3% in the anterior shoulder group and 19.2% in the placenta group. However, the study was not blinded and was limited by its small sample size."
"What is the best way to identify patients with white-coat hypertension
We examined to what extent self-measurement of blood pressure at home (HBP) can be an alternative to ambulatory monitoring (ABP) to diagnose white-coat hypertension. In 247 untreated patients, we compared the white-coat effects obtained by HBP and ABP. The thresholds to diagnose hypertension were > or = 140/> or = 90 mmHg for conventional blood pressure (CBP) and > or = 135/> or = 85 mmHg for daytime ABP and HBP. Mean systolic/diastolic CBP, HBP and ABP were 155.4/100.0, 143.1/91.5 and 148.1/95.0 mmHg, respectively. The white-coat effect was 5.0/3.5 mmHg larger on HBP compared with ABP (12.3/8.6 versus 7.2/5.0 mmHg; P < 0.001). The correlation coefficients between the white-coat effects based on HBP and ABP were 0.74 systolic and 0.60 diastolic (P < 0.001). With ABP as a reference, the specificity of HBP to detect white-coat hypertension was 88.6%, and the sensitivity was 68.4%. Our findings are in line with the recommendations of the ASH Ad Hoc Panel that recommends HBP for screening while ABP has a better prognostic accuracy.","In the treatment of hypertension based on home or office blood pressure study (247 subjects), which used ambulatory blood pressure monitoring as the reference method, home blood pressure had a high specificity (89%) and high negative predictive value (PV-) (97%) but a lower sensitivity (68%) and low positive predictive value (33%). In other words, if home blood pressure shows hypertension, there is a 97% chance the patient has sustained hypertension, but if home blood pressure returns to normal in patients with office hypertension, two thirds of patients will still have sustained hypertension."
"How effective are exercise and physical therapy for chronic low back pain
To determine the quality of randomised controlled trials of exercise therapy for back pain. Computer aided search of published papers and blinded assessment of the methods of studies. 23 randomised controlled trials, of which 16 studied exercise therapy given by physiotherapists to individual patients with back pain. Other conservative treatments could be included. Score for quality of methods (based on four main categories: study population, interventions, measurement of effect, and data presentation and analysis) and main conclusion of author(s) with regard to exercise therapy. Only four studies scored more than 50 points (maximum 100), indicating that most were of poor quality. Six studies found that exercise was better than reference treatments and 10 reported it to be no better or worse than the reference treatment. Those reporting positive results tended to have higher methods scores (4/6 positive v 4/10 negative scored greater than or equal to 42). No conclusion can be drawn about whether exercise therapy is better than other conservative treatments for back pain or whether a specific type of exercise is more effective. Further trials are needed in which greater attention is paid to methods of study.",The first meta-analysis of 16 chronic low back pain RCTs in 1991 had inconsistent results on the efficacy of exercise and showed little evidence in favor of any specific exercise format.
"When and how should you evaluate a child for obstructive sleep apnea
(1) To determine the extent to which tonsil size contributes to the severity of obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) in children; and (2) to assess the use of tonsillar-pharyngeal (TP) ratio in differentiating patients with different severity of OSA. Lateral neck radiograph was performed on 35 children referred consecutively to a university paediatric chest clinic for suspected OSA secondary to tonsillar hypertrophy. The tonsil size was determined by measuring the TP ratio on the radiographs. The severity of OSA was assessed by overnight polysomnography. A total of 24 boys and 11 girls (median age 6.2 years) were studied. All presented with symptoms of OSA, and tonsillar hypertrophy was detected on clinical examination. The median apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI) was 16.93 (interquartile range: 8.41 to 28.29). The median TP ratio was 0.76 (interquartile range: 0.65 to 0.80). AHI was positively correlated with the TP ratio. The clinical tonsil size did not correlate with the AHI or the TP ratio. Using a TP ratio of 0.479, the sensitivity and specificity in predicting cases with moderate/severe OSA (AHI >10) were 95.8% and 81.8% respectively, while the positive and negative predictive values were 92.0% and 90.0% respectively. Results show that in a population of children with OSA, tonsillar hypertrophy as assessed by lateral neck radiograph correlates positively with the severity of obstructive sleep apnoea. The TP ratio has high sensitivity and specificity in predicting those with moderate/severe disease and this feature may be used as a clinical screening method in prioritising patients with OSA for further assessment.","A prospective cohort study of 35 children compared the tonsillar-pharyngeal ratio measured from lateral neck x-rays to overnight polysomnography. X-ray measurements predicted moderate or severe obstructive sleep apnea on polysomnography (sensitivity=96%, specificity=82%, PPV=92%, NPV=90%), but did not accurately differentiate normal children from those with mild obstructive sleep apnea."
"What are the indications for evaluating a patient with cough for pertussis
Bordetella pertussis continues to circulate even in populations where a high vaccine coverage of infants and children is achieved. Cases in adolescents and adults are reported with increasing frequency in many countries. Adults are a reservoir for infections in very young infants, in whom pertussis may be severe and life-threatening. The salient clinical feature of pertussis in adolescents and adults is prolonged coughing, and recognising that pertussis does occur in these age groups is the most important step in its diagnosis. A laboratory diagnosis can be made by bordetella-PCR from nasopharyngeal swabs or secretions and by detection of antibodies, mainly to pertussis toxin; laboratory diagnosis is, however, not well standardised. Vaccination of adolescents and adults is now possible with acellular pertussis vaccines, which are well tolerated, immunogenic, and effective. Adolescent boosters and the vaccination of health-care workers are already included in vaccination calendars in some countries. Vaccine-recommending bodies and national health-care organisations must have locally relevant information on the transmission of pertussis from adults to infants to be able to make decisions on the advisability, feasibility, and priority for booster immunisation against pertussis.",Pertussis is an important cause of cough in all age groups. Ten prevalence studies of adolescents and adults seeking medical attention for a prolonged cough (defined variously as >1-4 weeks) found acute pertussis in 12% to 32%.
"Does treatment of acne with Retin A and tetracycline cause adverse effects
To study the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes) isolates to selected antibiotics from patients with acne vulgaris in Singapore and determine if resistance increases with prolonged use of antibiotics. A single-centre prospective study. Tertiary dermatological referral centre in Singapore. One hundred and fifty patients with acne vulgaris seen at the National Skin Centre. In patients who had never been on antibiotics, there were no resistant isolates of P. acnes. In patients who had been on short-term antibiotics (between 6 to 18 weeks), there were 2 resistant strains among the 34 isolates (6.25%); in patients who had been on antibiotics for longer periods, there were 11 resistant strains among the 51 isolates (21.6%). The differences in the rates of isolation of resistant strains between patients who had not been on antibiotics to those that had been on long-term antibiotics were statistically significant (P = 0.015). There was also a significant difference in isolation of resistant strains from those on short-term antibiotics compared to those who had been on long-term antibiotics (P = 0.036). Resistance to erythromycin was most commonly encountered. Most of the erythromycin-resistant strains also showed cross-resistance to clindamycin. The average MICs to antibiotics such as minocycline, erythromycin and clindamycin in those on long-term antibiotics were significantly higher when compared to patients who had not been on antibiotics. Antibiotic resistance in P. acnes isolates in Singapore follows similar patterns to studies conducted in Europe. Resistance to erythromycin was most commonly seen, and this is associated with cross-resistance to clindamycin. Among the tetracycline group of drugs, the average MICs to tetracycline was higher than that for doxycycline, which in turn was higher than that for minocycline. Antibiotic resistance can occur with short-term antibiotic courses, and the rate of resistance increases as the duration of antibiotic consumption increases.",A well-designed cohort trial showed that Propioni-bacteri-um acnes resistance was directly related to duration of antibiotic therapy.
"What's the most effective treatment for giardiasis
There can be a high rate of recurrence of disease after initial drug treatment for giardiasis. These drugs also have a range of adverse effects. The objective of this review was to assess the effects of drug treatments for giardiasis. We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group trials register, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, Medline and Embase, Current Contents, reference lists of articles. Randomised and quasi-randomised trials of drug therapy for giardiasis compared with placebo or another drug. Two reviewers independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Thirty-four trials were included. Only one trial was without serious methodological flaws. Compared with placebo, drug treatment was associated with an improved cure rate (odds ratio 11.5, 95% confidence interval 2.3 to 58). Metronidazole treatment longer than three days had a better parasitological cure rate than other long treatment courses (odds ratio 2.4, 95% confidence interval 1.3 to 4.4), but there was significant heterogeneity between the trials. Single dose therapy appeared equally effective as longer treatment courses (odds ratio 0.33, 95% confidence interval 0.08 to 1.34). Within the single dose regimens, tinidazole had a comparable parasitological cure rate to other short therapies (odds ratio 3.4, 95% confidence interval 0.95 to 12), but had a higher clinical cure rate (odds ratio 5.3, 95% 2.7-10.7). A single dose of tinidazole appears to give the highest clinical cure rate for giardiasis with relatively few adverse effects.","A 2006 Cochrane Review found no difference in clinical cure rate between short-term treatment (3 days) with metronidazole and longer therapy with metronidazole or other drugs. Subsequently, a single dose of metronidazole was found to be as effective as treatment for 5 days or longer (OR=0.33, 95% CI 0.08-1.34)."
"What are the indications for evaluating a patient with cough for pertussis
Concurrent outbreaks of illnesses that were manifested by cough and that were suspected to be due to Bordetella pertussis and Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection were investigated in a midwestern town in Illinois. Three studies were conducted: questionnaires on the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of illness were administered to patients; serological tests were performed to confirm the presence of each pathogen and to develop case definitions for each illness; and case definitions were applied to responses to a mail-in questionnaire for estimating the magnitude of both outbreaks. In 135 cases of suspected pertussis and 42 cases of suspected mycoplasmal infection, subjects had a cough for > or = 14 days (the pertussis outbreak case definition). Among 20 laboratory-confirmed cases, a cough for > or = 14 days had a specificity of 20% for pertussis, and a cough for > or = 28 days plus whoop and/or vomiting had a specificity of 90% for pertussis. Six hundred-seventeen pertussis cases per 100,000 population and 1,179 cases of M. pneumoniae infection per 100,000 population occurred. In this setting, the standard outbreak case definition for pertussis lacked adequate specificity to distinguish pertussis from mycoplasmal infection. The magnitude of each outbreak was greater than the number of reported cases suggested.","While cough longer than 2 weeks, inspiratory whoop, posttussive vomiting, coughing paroxysms, and absence of fever are commonly associated with pertussis, relatively few studies have assessed the sensitivities and specificities of these symptoms. Comparison groups were variously defined by negative pertussis cultures, negative pertussis serology, or serologic confirmation of other respiratory infections. Likelihood ratios (LR) were calculated from the data presented in each paper. The magnitude and variability of these likelihood ratios suggest that individual symptoms may be of limited help in distinguishing pertussis from other causes of prolonged cough. Combinations of symptoms may be slightly more helpful. In a study comparing 10 patients with culture-confirmed pertussis with 10 patients with serologically confirmed mycoplasma pneumonia, the combination of cough >14 days and whoop had a sensitivity of 80%, a positive likelihood ratio (LR+) of 8 and a negative likelihood ratio (LR-) of 0.22."
"Is an outpatient workup safe for patients with a transient ischemic attack
Management of patients with acute transient ischemic attack (TIA) varies widely, with some institutions admitting all patients and others proceeding with outpatient evaluations. Defining the short-term prognosis and risk factors for stroke after TIA may provide guidance in determining which patients need rapid evaluation. To determine the short-term risk of stroke and other adverse events after emergency department (ED) diagnosis of TIA. Cohort study conducted from March 1997 through February 1998 in 16 hospitals in a health maintenance organization in northern California. Patients A total of 1707 patients (mean age, 72 years) identified by ED physicians as having presented with TIA. Risk of stroke during the 90 days after index TIA; other events, including death, recurrent TIA, and hospitalization for cardiovascular events. During the 90 days after index TIA, 180 patients (10.5%) returned to the ED with a stroke, 91 of which occurred in the first 2 days. Five factors were independently associated with stroke: age greater than 60 years (odds ratio [OR], 1.8; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1-2.7; P=.01), diabetes mellitus (OR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.4-2.9; P<.001), symptom duration longer than 10 minutes (OR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.3-4.2; P=.005), weakness (OR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.4-2.6; P<.001), and speech impairment (OR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.1-2.1; P=.01). Stroke or other adverse events occurred in 428 patients (25.1%) in the 90 days after the TIA and included 44 hospitalizations for cardiovascular events (2.6%), 45 deaths (2.6%), and 216 recurrent TIAs (12.7%). Our results indicate that the short-term risk of stroke and other adverse events among patients who present to an ED with a TIA is substantial. Characteristics of the patient and the TIA may be useful for identifying patients who may benefit from expeditious evaluation and treatment.","In a large retrospective cohort study, 5% of TIA patients returned to the emergency department with a stroke within the first 2 days after TIA. Another 6% returned with a stroke within 90 days. Five independent risk factors were identified: age >60 years, diabetes mellitus, duration of TIA longer than 10 minutes, signs or symptoms of weakness, and speech impairment. Thirty-four percent of patients with all 5 risk factors, and none of the patients without any risk factors, had a stroke within 90 days. Of note, 13% of the TIA patients had an arrhythmia, congestive heart failure, unstable angina, myocardial infarction, stroke, or recurrent TIA within 4 days of initial presenting with a TIA. Twenty-five percent of the patients experienced 1 of these cardiovascular events during the 3 months of follow-up."
"Which drugs are safest for moderate to severe depression in adolescents
This Task Force report by the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology evaluates the safety and efficacy of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRIs) antidepressants for depressed youth under 18 years. The report was undertaken after regulatory agencies in the United States and United Kingdom raised concerns in 2003 about the possibility that treatment of depression in children and adolescents with SSRIs may increase the risk of suicidal thinking or suicide attempts.",American College of Neuropsychopharmacology argues that the risk-to-benefit ratio favors drug treatment for moderate to severe adolescent depression.
"How much can exercise raise creatine kinase level-and does it matter
Increased serum enzyme activity after exercise was first reported in 1958; subsequent studies have established that many factors determine the degree to which the serum activities of a variety of enzymes increase during and after exercise. The serum activities of those enzymes found especially in muscle, particularly creatine kinase, increase in proportion to the intensity and duration of the preceding exercise, peaking 24 hours after exercise; the effect of duration is dominant, so that the highest postexercise serum enzyme activities are found after very prolonged competitive exercise such as ultradistance marathon running or triathlon events. Weight-bearing exercises which include eccentric muscular contractions such as bench stepping and downhill running induce the greatest increases in serum enzyme activities; serum enzyme activities increase very little even after prolonged participation in those non-weight-bearing activities such as swimming and cycling which do not include eccentric muscular contractions. Prolonged (greater than 2 hours) daily training or competition in weight-bearing activities produces chronically elevated serum enzyme activities. Serum enzyme activities increase more with exercise in males, Blacks and the untrained than they do in females, Whites and the trained, respectively; age does not appear to influence the degree to which serum enzyme activities increase with exercise. There is a remarkable individual variability in the degree to which serum enzyme activities increase with exercise; a 50-fold difference in post-race serum creatine kinase activities has been found in healthy and equally trained athletes completing the same 90km ultramarathon footrace. The biochemical explanation for this degree of individual variability is not currently understood; possibly persons who show abnormally large increases in serum enzyme activities with exercise may have as yet unrecognised subclinical myopathies. No circadian rhythms have been identified for serum enzyme activities; activities rise during the day because of increased physical activity. The rise in serum enzyme activities is greater after exercise at altitude or in the heat than after equivalent exercise at sea level or in the cold. The most likely explanation for the increased serum enzyme activities that follow prolonged weight-bearing activities that also cause marked muscle soreness, is myofibrillar damage in particular sarcomeric Z-disk disruption.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","Increases in creatine kinase are more pronounced in males, blacks, and untrained people; age does not seem to be a factor."
"What is the most effective treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in children
Previous studies have demonstrated the short-term efficacy of pharmacotherapy and behavior therapy for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), but no longer-term (i.e., >4 months) investigations have compared these 2 treatments or their combination. A group of 579 children with ADHD Combined Type, aged 7 to 9.9 years, were assigned to 14 months of medication management (titration followed by monthly visits); intensive behavioral treatment (parent, school, and child components, with therapist involvement gradually reduced over time); the two combined; or standard community care (treatments by community providers). Outcomes were assessed in multiple domains before and during treatment and at treatment end point (with the combined treatment and medication management groups continuing medication at all assessment points). Data were analyzed through intent-to-treat random-effects regression procedures. All 4 groups showed sizable reductions in symptoms over time, with significant differences among them in degrees of change. For most ADHD symptoms, children in the combined treatment and medication management groups showed significantly greater improvement than those given intensive behavioral treatment and community care. Combined and medication management treatments did not differ significantly on any direct comparisons, but in several instances (oppositional/aggressive symptoms, internalizing symptoms, teacher-rated social skills, parent-child relations, and reading achievement) combined treatment proved superior to intensive behavioral treatment and/or community care while medication management did not. Study medication strategies were superior to community care treatments, despite the fact that two thirds of community-treated subjects received medication during the study period. For ADHD symptoms, our carefully crafted medication management was superior to behavioral treatment and to routine community care that included medication. Our combined treatment did not yield significantly greater benefits than medication management for core ADHD symptoms, but may have provided modest advantages for non-ADHD symptom and positive functioning outcomes.","A large randomized trial of 579 children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (20% girls) aged 7 to 9.9 years compared outcomes of 4 treatment strategies: stimulant medication, intensive behavioral treatment, combined stimulant medication and behavioral interventions, and standard community care. All children met the DSM-IV. criteria for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder Combined Type (the most common type of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in this age group). The stimulant medication strategy included an initial dose titration period followed by monthly 30-minute visits. Intensive behavioral treatment involved child, parent, and school personnel components of therapy. Combination therapy added the regimens for medication and behavioral treatment together. Standard community care consisted of usual (nonsystematic) care, evaluated at 6 different sites. After 14 months of treatment, children in the medication group and the combined treatment groups showed more improvement in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder symptoms than children given intensive behavioral treatment or those who received standard community care. When combined with medication, those treated with behavioral therapy showed slight improvement in social skills, anxiety, aggression, oppositional behavior, and academic achievement over medication alone. At the conclusion of the study, 74% of the 212 children on medication were successfully maintained on methylphenidate alone, 10% required dextroamphetamine, and no children required more than one medication. This study found that higher doses of medication with more frequent office follow-up and regular school contact were important features of successful treatment. Only 40% of families were able to complete the intensive behavioral therapy."
"What is the best treatment for infants with colic
There is controversy regarding whether hypersensitivity to food proteins contributes to colic among breastfed infants. A randomized, controlled trial of a low-allergen maternal diet was conducted among exclusively breastfed infants presenting with colic. In the active arm, mothers excluded cow's milk, eggs, peanuts, tree nuts, wheat, soy, and fish from their diet; mothers in the control group continued to consume these foods. Outcomes were assessed after 7 days, as the change in cry/fuss duration over 48 hours, with validated charts. The primary end point was a reduction in cry/fuss duration of > or =25% from baseline. Mothers also assessed the responses to diet with categorical and visual analog scales. Of 107 infants, 90 completed the trial (mean age: 5.7 weeks; range: 2.9-8.6 weeks; 54 male infants). Infants in both groups presented with significant distress (geometric mean: low-allergen group: 690 minutes per 48 hours; control group: 631 minutes per 48 hours). In follow-up assessments on days 8 and 9, there were significantly more responders in the low-allergen group (74% vs 37%), ie, an absolute risk reduction of 37% (95% confidence interval: 18-56%). Cry/fuss duration per 48 hours was reduced by a substantially greater amount in the low-allergen group; the adjusted geometric mean ratio was 0.79 (95% confidence interval: 0.63-0.97), ie, an average reduction of 21% (95% confidence interval: 3-37%). Mothers' subjective assessments of the responses to diet indicated little difference between the groups. Exclusion of allergenic foods from the maternal diet was associated with a reduction in distressed behavior among breastfed infants with colic presenting in the first 6 weeks of life.","A randomized controlled trial showed significant improvement in distress scores of infants whose mothers followed a low-allergen diet (excluding dairy, soy, wheat, eggs, peanuts, tree nuts, and fish) for 7 days. This well-designed study included 107 patients (a relatively large sample in the published research about colic), and showed an absolute risk reduction of 37% (NNT=3) for those mothers following the challenge."
"What's the best way to motivate patients to exercise
The Guide to Community Preventive Service's methods for systematic reviews were used to evaluate the effectiveness of various approaches to increasing physical activity: informational, behavioral and social, and environmental and policy approaches. Changes in physical activity behavior and aerobic capacity were used to assess effectiveness. Two informational interventions (""point-of-decision"" prompts to encourage stair use and community-wide campaigns) were effective, as were three behavioral and social interventions (school-based physical education, social support in community settings, and individually-adapted health behavior change) and one environmental and policy intervention (creation of or enhanced access to places for physical activity combined with informational outreach activities). Additional information about applicability, other effects, and barriers to implementation are provided for these interventions. Evidence is insufficient to assess a number of interventions: classroom-based health education focused on information provision, and family-based social support (because of inconsistent findings); mass media campaigns and college-based health education and physical education (because of an insufficient number of studies); and classroom-based health education focused on reducing television viewing and video game playing (because of insufficient evidence of an increase in physical activity). These recommendations should serve the needs of researchers, planners, and other public health decision makers.","""Green"" prescriptions are primary care behavioral interventions that include measurable goals, self-reward, structured problem-solving, social network reinforcement, and relapse prevention counseling. In the department of health and human services review, 10 trials studied green prescriptions; the median net increase in physical activity time was 35.4% (interquartile range 16.7%-83.3%)."
"What steps can reduce morbidity and mortality caused by hip fractures
There is a perception that the standard of care is to repair hip fractures surgically within 24 hours of hospitalization. However, it is unclear whether this reduces mortality or morbidity. We performed a retrospective study in consecutive hip fracture patients, aged 60 years or older, who underwent surgical repair. Patients with metastatic cancer, trauma, or a fracture occurring >48 hours before admission were excluded. The primary outcome was long-term (up to 18 years) mortality. Secondary outcomes included 30-day mortality and decubitus ulcers, serious bacterial infections, myocardial infarction, and thromboembolism. Analyses were adjusted for medical conditions; the comparison group comprised patients who underwent surgery for hip fracture repair within 24 to 48 hours because there were no patients with active medical problems who underwent surgery within 24 hours. Of the 8383 patients, surgery was delayed for more than 24 hours in 2464 patients (29%) for medical reasons and in 1341 patients (16%) without active medical problems. Compared with those who underwent surgery 24 to 48 hours after admission to the hospital, patients who underwent surgery more than 96 hours after admission did not have increased long-term mortality (hazard ratio = 1.07; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.95 to 1.21), although the risk of decubitus ulcer was increased (odds ratio = 2.2; 95% CI: 1.6 to 3.1). There were no associations between time-to-surgery and the other secondary outcomes. Time-to-surgery in hip fracture patients was not associated with short- or long-term mortality after adjusting for active medical problems. Other than increasing the risk of decubitus ulcer formation, waiting did not appear to affect patients' outcomes adversely.",Some studies did not find decreased mortality with earlier surgical intervention. Complication rates (such as decubitus ulcers) increase with a delay in surgery.
"Do antiarrhythmics prevent sudden death in patients with heart failure
Asymptomatic ventricular arrhythmias in patients with congestive heart failure are associated with increased rates of overall mortality and sudden death. Amiodarone is now used widely to prevent ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation. We conducted a trial to determine whether amiodarone can reduce overall mortality in patients with congestive heart failure and asymptomatic ventricular arrhythmias. We used a double-blind, placebo-controlled protocol in which 674 patients with symptoms of congestive heart failure, cardiac enlargement, 10 or more premature ventricular contractions per hour, and a left ventricular ejection fraction of 40 percent or less were randomly assigned to receive amiodarone (336 patients) or placebo (338 patients). The primary end point was overall mortality, and the median follow-up was 45 months (range, 0 to 54). There was no significant difference in overall mortality between the two treatment groups (P = 0.6). The two-year actuarial survival rate was 69.4 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 64.2 to 74.6) for the patients in the amiodarone group and 70.8 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 65.7 to 75.9) for those in the placebo group. At two years, the rate of sudden death was 15 percent in the amiodarone group and 19 percent in the placebo group (P = 0.43). There was a trend toward a reduction in overall mortality among the patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy who received amiodarone (P = 0.07). Amiodarone was significantly more effective in suppressing ventricular arrhythmias and increased the left ventricular ejection fraction by 42 percent at two years. Although amiodarone was effective in suppressing ventricular arrhythmias and improving ventricular function, it did not reduce the incidence of sudden death or prolong survival among patients with heart failure, except for a trend toward reduced mortality among those with nonischemic cardiomyopathy.",The largest placebo-controlled trial in heart failure failed to detect a significant decrease in sudden death.
"What causes a low thyroid-stimulating hormone level with a normal free T4 level
Low serum thyrotropin concentrations are a sensitive indicator of hyperthyroidism but can also occur in persons who have no clinical manifestations of the disorder. We studied whether low serum thyrotropin concentrations in clinically euthyroid older persons are a risk factor for subsequent atrial fibrillation. We studied 2007 persons (814 men and 1193 women) 60 years of age or older who did not have atrial fibrillation in order to determine the frequency of this arrhythmia during a 10-year follow-up period. The subjects were classified according to their serum thyrotropin concentrations: those with low values (< or = 0.1 mU per liter; 61 subjects); those with slightly low values (> 0.1 to 0.4 mU per liter; 187 subjects); those with normal values (> 0.4 to 5.0 mU per liter; 1576 subjects); and those with high values (> 5.0 mU per liter; 183 subjects). During the 10-year follow-up period, atrial fibrillation occurred in 13 persons with low initial values for serum thyrotropin, 23 with slightly low values, 133 with normal values, and 23 with high values. The cumulative incidence of atrial fibrillation at 10 years was 28 percent among the subjects with low serum thyrotropin values (< or = 0.1 mU per liter), as compared with 11 percent among those with normal values; the age-adjusted incidence of atrial fibrillation was 28 per 1000 person-years among those with low values and 10 per 1000 person-years among those with normal values (P = 0.005). After adjustment for other known risk factors, the relative risk of atrial fibrillation in elderly subjects with low serum thyrotropin concentrations, as compared with those with normal concentrations, was 3.1 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.7 to 5.5; P < 0.001). The 10-year incidence of atrial fibrillation in the groups with slightly low and high serum thyrotropin values was not significantly different from that in the group with normal values. Among people 60 years of age or older, a low serum thyrotropin concentration is associated with a threefold higher risk that atrial fibrillation will develop in the subsequent decade.","In patients with subclinical hypothyroidism aged >60 years, the cumulative incidence of atrial fibrillation after 10 years varied with the serum thyroid-stimulating hormone level: it was 28% in those with serum thyroid-stimulating hormone <0.1 mIU/L; 16% in those with values between 0.1 and 0.4 mIU/L, and 11 % in those with normal values."
"Are tympanostomy tubes indicated for recurrent acute otitis media
Increasing concerns over drug-resistant bacteria mandate that alternative methods of treatment and prevention, including surgery, be considered to reduce antibiotic usage for acute otitis media (AOM). Meta-analysis of five randomized trials of tubes versus no surgery showed a mean absolute decrease in AOM incidence of 1.0 episode per child-year (95% CI, 0.4-1.6), with a relative decrease of 56%. Similarly, the prevalence of middle-ear effusion decreased by 115 days per child-year (95% CI, 11-220). Within several weeks of tube placement 79% of children had improved quality of life, 17% had trivial change, and 4% were worse. Systematic review of 134 articles revealed transient post-operative otorrhea in 16% of patients with tubes, and later in 26%; recurrent otorrhea occurred in 7.4% of patients and chronic otorrhea in 3.8% Adenoidectomy reduced AOM incidence by 0.32 episodes per child-year (95% CI, 0.03-0.61) for a 3-year period in one study (26% relative decrease), but the effect was only significant for children with prior tubes. Surgical therapy of otitis media offers significant benefits and is an effective prevention strategy in selected children.","A meta-analysis of 5 randomized trials comparing no surgery with placement of tubes for recurrent acute otitis media with or without middle-ear effusion showed that the placement of tubes resulted in a mean absolute decrease in acute otitis media incidence of 1.0 per year (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.4-1.6), and a decrease in the prevalence of middle-ear effusion by 115 days per year (95% CI, 11-220)."
"Which interventions are best for alleviating nipple pain in nursing mothers
to study the effect of birth centre care on the duration of breast feeding, breast feeding complications, and women's experiences of breast feeding. randomised controlled trial. in-hospital birth centre at South Hospital, Stockholm, and standard obstetric care in the Greater Stockholm area. 1230 women with expected date of birth between October 1989 and February 1992, interested in participating in a birth centre trial, and meeting medical low-risk criteria. 617 women were allocated to the experimental group offered birth centre care (EG), and 613 to the control group offered standard obstetric care (CG). duration of breast feeding, breast feeding complications such as sore nipples, engorgement, milk stasis, and mastitis, and women's experiences of breast feeding. no difference was found between EG and CG in the duration of breast feeding. Ninety-three per cent in both groups were breast feeding exclusively two months post partum. The average number of months of breast feeding, exclusively or partly, when investigated one year after the birth was 8.6 in EG and 8.5 in CG. No difference was observed in women's experiences of breast feeding, but rather more women in EG than in CG reported sore nipples, 36% and 30% respectively (p = 0.03), and milk stasis, 26% and 19% respectively (p = 0.002). birth centre care had no effect on the duration of breast feeding, or on women's experiences of breast feeding. Prenatal attitudes were probably more significant predictors of these outcomes than differences in the two modes of maternity care in this population of highly breast feeding-motivated women. The larger proportion of sore nipples and milk stasis in the EG might have been due to earlier discharge, or to midwives less skilled in assisting with breast feeding at the birth centre than in the postpartum wards.","In another randomized controlled trials performed in Sweden, women who received peripartum care in a birthing center had more nipple pain than women who delivered in a traditional hospital setting (NNT=16)."
"What are the current treatment and monitoring recommendations for hepatitis C virus HCV
Pilot studies suggested that more patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection had a sustained virological response when treated with the combination of interferon alpha-2b and ribavirin than with interferon alpha-2b alone. We investigated the biochemical and virological responses and safety of treatment with interferon alpha-2b and ribavirin compared with interferon alpha-2b alone. In this double-blind trial 100 patients were randomly assigned to treatment with interferon alpha-2b (3 MU three times a week) in combination with ribavirin (1000 or 1200 mg per day) or placebo for 24 weeks and then followed up for a further 24 weeks. A further follow-up was done 1 year after active treatment stopped. The primary endpoint was the sustained virological response, defined as no detectable HCV RNA by PCR at both week 24 and week 48. Retrospectively, the baseline HCV-RNA load was analysed as a predictor of a sustained virological response. Data were analysed by intention to treat. 18 (36%) of the 50 patients in the interferon alpha-2b and ribavirin group had a sustained virological response compared with nine (18%) of the 50 patients in the interferon alpha-2b and placebo group (p = 0.047). At the 1 year follow-up the proportion of patients with a virological response was greater in the interferon alpha-2b and ribavirin group than the interferon alpha-2b and placebo group (42 vs 20%, p = 0.03), respectively. More patients with baseline HCV-RNA concentrations greater than 3 x 10(6) genome equivalents (Eq) per mL had a sustained response with interferon alpha-2b and ribavirin than with interferon alpha-2b and placebo (12/29 vs 1/26, p = 0.009), whereas the sustained response did not differ between the two treatment groups for HCV-RNA amounts less than 3 x 10(6) Eq per mL (6/21 vs 8/24, p = 0.67), respectively. More patients with chronic hepatitis C have a sustained virological response with interferon alpha-2b and ribavirin than with only interferon alpha-2b treatment. We suggest that patients with high HCV-RNA loads should be treated with interferon alpha-2b and ribavirin.",Long-term sustained viral response was at least 50% at 2 years after dual therapy. Long-term response rates have been 30% with dual therapy in genotype 1 and 60% to 70% with genotypes 2 through 6.
"Does tamoxifen prevent breast cancer
Tamoxifen is a candidate chemopreventive agent in breast cancer, although the drug may be associated with the development of endometrial cancer. Therefore we did a trial in hysterectomised women of tamoxifen as a chemopreventive. In October, 1992, we started a double-blind placebo-controlled, randomised trial of tamoxifen in women (mainly in Italy) who did not have breast cancer and who had had a hysterectomy. Women were randomised to receive tamoxifen 20 mg per day or placebo, both orally for 5 years. The original plan was to follow the intervention phase by 5 years' follow-up. In June, 1997, the trialists and the data-monitoring committee decided to end recruitment primarily because of the number of women dropping out of the study. Recruitment ended on July 11, 1997, and the study will continue as planned. The primary endpoints are the occurrence of and deaths from breast cancer. This preliminary interim analysis is based on intention-to-treat. 5408 women were randomised; participating women have a median follow-up of 46 months for major endpoints. 41 cases of breast cancer occurred so far; there have been no deaths from breast cancer. There is no difference in breast-cancer frequency between the placebo (22 cases) and tamoxifen (19) arms. There is a statistically significant reduction of breast cancer among women receiving tamoxifen who also used hormone-replacement therapy during the trial: among 390 women on such therapy and allocated to placebo, we found eight cases of breast cancer compared with one case among 362 women allocated to tamoxifen. Compared with the placebo group, there was a significantly increased risk of vascular events and hypertriglyceridaemia among women on tamoxifen. Although this preliminary analysis has low power, in this cohort of women at low-to-normal risk of breast cancer, the postulated protective effects of tamoxifen are not yet apparent. Women using hormone-replacement therapy appear to have benefited from use of tamoxifen. There were no deaths from breast cancer recorded in women in the study. It is essential to continue follow-up to quantify the long-term risks and benefits of tamoxifen therapy.","An randomized controlled trials reported no overall benefit from treatment with tamoxifen in low-risk hysterectomized women, but the trial was underpowered, had a high dropout rate in the first year, and allowed hormone replacement therapy (HRT)."
"When should we stop mammography screening for breast cancer in elderly women
Mammography is recommended and is cost-effective for women aged 50 to 69 years, but the value of continuing screening mammography after age 69 years is not known. In particular, older women with low bone mineral density (BMD) have a lower risk of breast cancer and may benefit less from continued screening. To compare life expectancy and cost-effectiveness of screening mammography in elderly women based on 3 screening strategies. Decision analysis and cost-effectiveness analysis using a Markov model. General population of women aged 65 years or older. The analysis compared 3 strategies: (1) Undergoing biennial mammography from age 65 to 69 years; (2) undergoing biennial mammography from age 65 to 69 years, measurement of distal radial BMD at age 65 years, discontinuing screening at age 69 years in women in the lowest BMD quartile for age, and continuing biennial mammography to age 79 years in those in the top 3 quartiles of distal radius BMD; and (3) undergoing biennial mammography from age 65 to 79 years. Deaths due to breast cancer averted, life expectancy, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. Compared with discontinuing mammography screening at age 69 years, measuring BMD at age 65 years in 10000 women and continuing mammography to age 79 years only in women with BMD in the top 3 quartiles would prevent 9.4 deaths and add, on average, 2.1 days to life expectancy at an incremental cost of $66773 per year of life saved. Continuing mammography to age 79 years in all 10000 elderly women would prevent 1.4 additional breast cancer deaths and add only 7.2 hours to life expectancy at an incremental cost of $117689 per year of life saved compared with only continuing mammography to age 79 years in women with BMD in the top 3 quartiles. This analysis suggests that continuing mammography screening after age 69 years results in a small gain in life expectancy and is moderately cost-effective in those with high BMD and more costly in those with low BMD. Women's preferences for a small gain in life expectancy and the potential harms of screening mammography should play an important role when elderly women are deciding about screening.","In a cost-effectiveness analysis, Kerlikowske and coworkers included bone mineral density in the model, which is positively associated with breast cancer risk. They found a small benefit to screening for women with the highest quartile bone mineral density (highest cancer risk) and virtually no benefit in screening the lowest quartile BMD."
"Is surgery effective for reducing symptoms in adults with obstructive sleep apnea
This paper, which has been reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors of the American Sleep Disorders Association, provides the background for the Standards of Practice Committee's parameters for the practice of sleep medicine in North America. The intent of this paper is to provide an overview of the surgical treatment of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, to provide the basis for the American Sleep Disorders Association's practice parameters on this subject and to share our findings of metanalysis of previously published studies regarding uvulopalatopharyngoplasty. We searched MEDLINE from January 1966 through April 1993, with an update in February 1995, to provide a review of the application of surgical modifications of the upper airway to treat adults with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. Operations to treat obstructive sleep apnea syndrome include nasal septal reconstruction; uvulopalatopharyngoplasty; uvulopalatopharyngoglossoplasty; laser midline glossectomy; lingualplasty; inferior sagittal mandibular osteotomy and genioglossal advancement, with hyoid myotomy and suspension (the entire process is referred to as GAHM); maxillomandibular osteotomy and advancement, and tracheotomy. Papers included in metanalysis provided preoperative and postoperative polysomnographic data on at least nine patients treated with uvulopalatopharyngoplasty for their obstructive sleep apnea. Analysis of the uvulopalatopharyngoplasty papers revealed that this procedure is, at best, effective in treating less than 50% of patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. The site of pharyngeal narrowing or collapse, although identified by different and unvalidated methods, has a marked effect on the probability of success of uvulopalatopharyngoplasty. Patients who achieve a favorable response with uvulopalatopharyngoplasty tend to have less severe obstructive sleep apnea than those who do not. For patients who demonstrate retrolingual narrowing or collapse, other surgical modifications have been described, such as lingualplasty, GAHM, and maxillomandibular osteotomy and advancement. The studies to support the use of the surgical treatment of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome contain biases related to small sample size, limited follow-up and patient selection.",the most optimistic review estimates that less than 50% of patients with obstructive sleep apnea will benefit from surgery.
"What are contraindications to IUDs
Previous studies of intrauterine devices (IUDs), many of which are no longer in use, suggested that they might cause tubal infertility. The concern that IUDs that contain copper--currently the most commonly used type--may increase the risk of infertility in nulligravid women has limited the use of this highly effective method of birth control. We conducted a case-control study of 1895 women recruited between 1997 and 1999. We enrolled 358 women with primary infertility who had tubal occlusion documented by hysterosalpingography, as well as 953 women with primary infertility who did not have tubal occlusion (infertile controls) and 584 primigravid women (pregnant controls). We collected information on the women's past use of contraceptives, including copper IUDs, previous sexual relationships, and history of genital tract infections. Each woman's blood was tested for antibodies to Chlamydia trachomatis. We used stratified analyses and logistic regression to assess the association between the previous use of a copper IUD and tubal occlusion. In analyses involving the women with tubal occlusion and the infertile controls, the odds ratio for tubal occlusion associated with the previous use of a copper IUD was 1.0 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.6 to 1.7). When the primigravid women served as the controls, the corresponding odds ratio was 0.9 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.5 to 1.6). Tubal infertility was not associated with the duration of IUD use, the reason for the removal of the IUD, or the presence or absence of gynecologic problems related to its use. The presence of antibodies to chlamydia was associated with infertility. The previous use of a copper IUD is not associated with an increased risk of tubal occlusion among nulligravid women whereas infection with C. trachomatis is.",Short-term (≤3.5 years) IUD use by nulliparous women was not associated with decreased fertility in a case-control study.
"Do allergy shots help seasonal allergies more than antihistamines and nasal steroids
Systemic anaphylactic reactions occur in a small percentage of patients receiving allergen immunotherapy. A 1 year study was performed in a large health maintenance organization to determine the incidence of systemic reactions (SR) to allergen immunotherapy. We measured the number of SR that occurred during a 12 months period. A SR data sheet was completed for each reaction, documenting the time of onset, symptoms, treatment, history of asthma or previous reaction, and concentration and type of extract. Twenty-seven thousand eight hundred six injection visits resulted in 143 SR (0.51%). Forty-five percent of the patients (pts) with SR had a history of prior SR, 50% had a history of asthma, and 36% developed reactions in season. Seventy-two percent of SR started within 30 minutes, although 8% appeared after 2 hours. Fifty-seven percent of SR occurred at concentrations of 1,000-10,000 PNU/cc, 25% at 10-100 PNU/cc, and 17% when both concentrations were given at the same visit. Eighty-three percent of SR were judged to be mild, nonlife threatening reactions, requiring no treatment or antihistamine therapy only. Seventeen percent were judged to be more severe, requiring treatment with epinephrine, with or without other agents. SR are a small but definite risk of immunotherapy. Most SR are mild, but some may be life threatening. The majority of reactions occur within 30 minutes, but significant reactions may occur after 2 hours. A large percentage of SR occurred in patients with a history of asthma, previous SR, or both.","Allergy immunotherapy presents risk of systemic reactions, with one study reporting a 0.5% risk of systemic reactions per year of therapy."
"Does a knee brace decrease recurrent ACL injuries
This study prospectively randomized 62 patients to rehabilitation programs either with or without postoperative brace for 6 weeks following bone-tendon-bone anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. The nonbraced group had a smaller knee circumference 2 weeks after surgery. At 6-month follow-up the nonbraced group had a better Tegner score. At 2 years there was no difference between the groups. There was one partial rupture of the graft in the nonbraced group after a new trauma 1 year after surgery. There were no differences between the groups in either subjective or objective knee stability at 2 or 6 weeks or at follow-up 3, 6, and 24 months after surgery. This study found no benefit of using a postoperative knee brace on patients' knee function at any stage up to 24 months after surgery. Furthermore, the braced group was not more stable than the nonbraced group, indicating that the brace does not contribute to a more stable knee during rehabilitation or 2-year follow-up.","In a prospective study of 62 patients, researchers found no benefit from using a postoperative knee brace at any stage (2 and 6 weeks; 3, 6, and 24 months) after surgery. Moreover, the brace did not contribute to a more stable knee during rehabilitation or 2-year follow-up."
"Does group prenatal care improve pregnancy outcomes
This is a time of change within the health care system. This has created a challenge for health care providers to develop creative new patterns that will provide quality service within a system that is mandating more economy and efficiency. The Centering Pregnancy program abolishes routine prenatal care by bringing women out of examination rooms and into groups for their care. The design incorporates the three components of prenatal care--risk assessment, education, and support--into one entity. Women are placed into groups of 8 to 12 based on estimated dates of delivery and meet for ten 90-minute prenatal or postpartum visits at regular intervals. At these visits, standard prenatal risk assessment is completed within the group setting, an educational format is followed that uses a didactic discussion format, and time is provided for women to talk and share with one another. By incorporating these three components into one whole, emphasis is placed on their collective importance. Women are encouraged to take responsibility for themselves; this leads to a shift in the client-provider power base. Evaluative data demonstrated that 96% of the women preferred receiving their prenatal care in groups. This model is interdisciplinary in design and demonstrates provider satisfaction, as well as efficiency in delivery of care. It is an excellent model for the care of teens and for midwives and nurse practitioners to lead. The combination of satisfaction, good outcomes, and effective delivery of care makes this an attractive model for agencies to implement.","One cohort trial found that women enrolled in group prenatal care used the emergency department less during the third trimester (NNT=2, P=.001)."
"What are the indications for tonsillectomy in children
Adenoidectomy and adenotonsillectomy are commonly performed in US children to reduce the occurrence of persistent or recurrent otitis media, but evidence supporting the efficacy of the operations is limited. To test the efficacy of adenoidectomy and adenotonsillectomy in children with persistent or recurrent otitis media who had not previously undergone tube placement and to compare the relative efficacy of adenoidectomy alone vs adenotonsillectomy in such children. Two parallel randomized clinical trials. A total of 461 children aged 3 to 15 years were enrolled at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh, Pa, between April 1980 and April 1994. Four hundred ten children were observed for up to 3 years. Children without recurrent throat infection or tonsillar hypertrophy (304 enrolled; 266 followed up) were randomized to either an adenoidectomy, adenotonsillectomy, or control group; children who had such conditions (157 enrolled; 144 followed up) were randomized to an adenotonsillectomy or control group. Occurrence rate of episodes of acute otitis media by treatment group and estimated proportion of time with otitis media. In both trials, most subjects were eligible because of recurrent acute otitis media, with or without persistent otitis media with effusion. A total of 47 children assigned to surgical treatment groups had no surgery. The efficacy of surgery in both trials was modest and limited mainly to the first follow-up year. The largest differences in that year were found in the 3-way trial between the adenotonsillectomy group and the control group: mean annual rate of episodes of acute otitis media, 1.4 vs 2.1 (P<.001); and mean estimated percentage of time with otitis media, 18.6% vs 29.9% (difference, 11.3%; 95% confidence interval, 4.4%-18.2%; P=.002). Perioperative and postoperative complications or other adverse events occurred not infrequently, especially among subjects undergoing adenotonsillectomy (14.6%). Our study showed limited and short-term efficacy of both adenoidectomy and adenotonsillectomy; given the risks, morbidity, and costs of these procedures, these data suggest that neither operation should ordinarily be considered as a first surgical intervention in children whose only indication is recurrent acute otitis media.","In the largest study, controls had a mean of 2.1 episodes of recurrent otitis media in the first postoperative year while those undergoing adenotonsillectomy had had 1.8 episodes (P=.25) and those undergoing adenoidectomy had 1.4 episodes (P<.001). However, these benefits did not persist beyond the first year. Several case series report no evidence of effectiveness of tonsillectomy for immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathy, psoriasis, or nocturnal enuresis."
"How should you treat Candida vaginitis in patients on antibiotics
Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) is one of the most common causes of vaginitis, and its incidence has increased markedly during the past three decades. The widespread overuse of antibiotics has been suggested as one of the major factors contributing to the increasing incidence of VVC. However, evidence supporting this association has been limited because few studies with rigorous scientific methodology have been conducted. Moreover, existing data regarding the risk for developing VVC after antibiotic use are conflicting. This review examines the available information in the literature regarding antibiotic-associated VVC, its incidence, and its potential mechanisms. Implications for clinical practice and research are also discussed.","A 2003 systematic review found the evidence supporting the association between antibiotics and vulvovaginal candidiasis limited and contradictory. Most were case-control or cohort studies with small sample sizes. No RCTs compare the incidence of culture-confirmed vulvovaginal candidiasis among women receiving antibiotics or placebo. Nineteen reports of 18 original studies had sufficient data to calculate a relative risk or odds ratio for antibiotic-associated VVC. Thirteen of the 19 reports showed an increase (around twofold; range, 0.43-5) in vaginal Candida prevalence; however, 3 of the 13 reports had no mycological culture data. Six studies did not show significant association between antibiotics and vaginal yeast."
"Are there any known health risks to early introduction of solids to an infant's diet
Scientific evidence is scarce about timing of solid-food introduction and its association with the development of atopy. We aimed to evaluate any associations between the introduction of cow milk products/other solid food products and infant atopic manifestations in the second year of life, taking into account reverse causation. Data from 2558 infants in an ongoing prospective birth cohort study in the Netherlands were analyzed. Data on the main determinants (introduction of cow milk products and other food products), outcomes (eczema; atopic dermatitis [United Kingdom Working Party criteria]; recurrent wheeze; any sensitization; sensitization against cow milk, hen egg, peanut, and at least 1 inhalant allergen), and confounders were collected by repeated questionnaires at 34 weeks of gestation and 3, 7, 12, and 24 months postpartum. Information on sensitization was gathered by venous blood collections performed during home visits at age 2. Analyses were performed by multiple logistic regression analyses. More delay in introduction of cow milk products was associated with a higher risk for eczema. In addition, a delayed introduction of other food products was associated with an increased risk for atopy development at the age of 2 years. Exclusion of infants with early symptoms of eczema and recurrent wheeze (to avoid reverse causation) did not essentially change our results. Delaying the introduction of cow milk or other food products may not be favorable in preventing the development of atopy.","A Dutch prospective cohort study (N=2558) not only confirmed the findings that there is no benefit in delaying solids longer than 4 months or potentially allergenic solids longer than 6 months to prevent eczema, but found a higher risk of atopy at 2 years of age after delayed introduction of solids, even after accounting for reverse causation (delaying solids in children with early atopic symptoms)."
"How effective are exercise and physical therapy for chronic low back pain
A systematic review of randomized controlled trials. To assess the effectiveness of the most common conservative types of treatment for patients with acute and chronic nonspecific low back pain. Many treatment options for acute and chronic low back pain are available, but little is known about the optimal treatment strategy. A rating system was used to assess the strength of the evidence, based on the methodologic quality of the randomized controlled trials, the relevance of the outcome measures, and the consistency of the results. The number of randomized controlled trials identified varied widely with regard to the interventions involved. The scores ranged from 20 to 79 points for acute low back pain and from 19 to 79 points for chronic low back pain on a 100-point scale, indicating the overall poor quality of the trials. Overall, only 28 (35%) randomized controlled trials on acute low back pain and 20 (25%) on chronic low back pain had a methodologic score of 50 or more points, and were considered to be of high quality. Various methodologic flaws were identified. Strong evidence was found for the effectiveness of muscle relaxants and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and the ineffectiveness of exercise therapy for acute low back pain; strong evidence also was found for the effectiveness of manipulation, back schools, and exercise therapy for chronic low back pain, especially for short-term effects. The quality of the design, execution, and reporting of randomized controlled trials should be improved, to establish strong evidence for the effectiveness of the various therapeutic interventions for acute and chronic low back pain.","A review reported that exercise, back manipulation, and intense back schools were equally efficacious."
"Does neonatal circumcision decrease morbidity
The aim of this study was to determine whether circumcision affects significant bacteriuria in boys. During a 60-month prospective study, 100 boys with microbiologically confirmed symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI) were evaluated. Twelve patients with abnormal ultrasonography findings were excluded from the study. Eighteen of the boys had not been circumcised due to parental choice. The remaining 70 boys with normal renal ultrasonography were randomly allocated into two groups. In the first group 35 boys ranging in age from 6 months to 10 years (mean 33.2+/-30.9 months) were observed for 6 months and urinary cultures were taken monthly. When they had a positive urine culture (with or without any symptoms), they received antibiotic treatment. After 6 months they were circumcised and then observed for another 6-month period. Group 2 comprised 35 boys aged from 3 months to 9 years (mean 29.1+/-36.7 months). They were circumcised immediately after the first UTI and were followed for 6 months. Urine samples were obtained by the bag technique in infants and by the mid-stream technique in older patients. In the uncircumcised group, the rate of significant bacteriuria per patient did not change in two 6-month follow-up periods (3.46+/-0.91 and 3.33+/-0.97 episodes). In group 1, the rate of positive urine cultures dropped from 3.57+/-1.11 to 0.14+/-0.35 episodes after circumcision (P<0.001). In the second group, the rate of significant bacteriuria was 0.17+/-0.38 episodes after circumcision. Among the uncircumcised patients, symptomatic UTI was observed in 6 cases (3 cases in the first period of group 1, 1 case in the first and 2 cases in the second period of the uncircumcised group), whereas after circumcision no patient had symptomatic UTI. The mean age at circumcision was 42.7+/-28.4 months. No complication due to circumcision occurred in any patient. UTI may also occur in boys after the 1st year of life. The present study indicated that circumcision in boys decreases the rate of positive urine cultures. Therefore circumcision could be considered as a part of UTI therapy.","A randomized controlled trial of circumcision for urinary tract infection prevention was not during the neonatal period (average age was 30 months) and focused on secondary prevention. It demonstrated a statistically significant decrease in the rate of bacteriuria. The long-term effect on urinary tract infection incidence, renal scarring, and subsequent complications such as hypertension and end-stage renal disease is unknown."
"Angiotensin blockade for diabetes: Monitor microalbuminuria
Microalbuminuria and hypertension are risk factors for diabetic nephropathy. Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system slows the progression to diabetic nephropathy in patients with type 1 diabetes, but similar data are lacking for hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes. We evaluated the renoprotective effect of the angiotensin-II-receptor antagonist irbesartan in hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria. A total of 590 hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria were enrolled in this multinational, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of irbesartan, at a dose of either 150 mg daily or 300 mg daily, and were followed for two years. The primary outcome was the time to the onset of diabetic nephropathy, defined by persistent albuminuria in overnight specimens, with a urinary albumin excretion rate that was greater than 200 microg per minute and at least 30 percent higher than the base-line level. The base-line characteristics in the three groups were similar. Ten of the 194 patients in the 300-mg group (5.2 percent) and 19 of the 195 patients in the 150-mg group (9.7 percent) reached the primary end point, as compared with 30 of the 201 patients in the placebo group (14.9 percent) (hazard ratios, 0.30 [95 percent confidence interval, 0.14 to 0.61; P< 0.001] and 0.61 [95 percent confidence interval, 0.34 to 1.08; P=0.081 for the two irbesartan groups, respectively). The average blood pressure during the course of the study was 144/83 mm Hg in the placebo group, 143/83 mm Hg in the 150-mg group, and 141/83 mm Hg in the 300-mg group (P=0.004 for the comparison of systolic blood pressure between the placebo group and the combined irbesartan groups). Serious adverse events were less frequent among the patients treated with irbesartan (P=0.02). Irbesartan is renoprotective independently of its blood-pressure-lowering effect in patients with type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria.","During a 2-year trial-in which 590 patients with diabetes and microalbuminuria were randomized to receive placebo, 150 mg irbesartan, or 300 mg irbesartan-14.9% of the placebo group, 9.7% of the 150-mg group, and only 5.2% of the 300-mg group progressed to overt nephropathy."
"Do nasal decongestants relieve symptoms
The common cold is a major and recurrent cause of morbidity, affecting children and adults two or more times each year. Nasal congestion is its commonest symptom, and many therapies are marketed for its relief. There is no meta-analysis of controlled clinical trials on the effects of nasal decongestants for the common cold. To assess the efficacy of nasal decongestants at reducing the symptom of nasal congestion in adults and children with the common cold and to identify possible adverse effects associated with their use. MEDLINE, EMBASE and Current Contents were searched up to May 1999. Searching the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's trials register, following the review citation trail from other references and contacting known principal investigators and pharmaceutical companies was also done. Randomised, placebo controlled trials of single-active oral and topical nasal decongestants in adults and children suffering from the common cold. Data were independently extracted by two reviewers (DT and LB). All outcomes variables were continuous. Subjective outcomes were normalised to a common scale and a weighted mean difference (WMD) was calculated. A standardised mean difference (SMD) was calculated for the objective outcomes. Four studies in adults, but none in children, fitted all inclusion criteria. There was a significant 13% decrease in subjective symptoms after decongestant compared with placebo. This was supported by a significant decrease in nasal airways resistance. Repeated doses of nasal decongestant were not significantly better than placebo at relieving symptoms of nasal congestion. A single dose of nasal decongestant in the common cold is moderately effective for the short term relief of congestion in adults, while there is no evidence available to show benefit after repeated use over several days. These medications are not recommended for use in young children with the common cold.","A Cochrane review of 4 randomized controlled trials compared single doses of oxymetazoline, pseudoephedrine, and phenylpropanolamine. Included studies involved from 30 to 106 participants, were double-blinded and placebo-controlled, used either topical or oral decongestants for symptoms of less than 5 days' duration, and measured either subjective or objective relief or adverse events. All 4 studies used nasal airway resistance as an objective measure of nasal congestion, and a combined symptom score as a subjective measure of relief. One study also administered a side-effect questionnaire. In all studies, topical and oral decongestants were equally efficacious, producing a 13% reduction in subjective symptoms and a significant decrease in nasal airway resistance after 1 dose of decongestant. Only 1 study investigated repeated doses of decongestants and found no significant additional improvement from repeated doses over a 5-day period. More studies are needed to evaluate efficacy of multiple doses. Clinical interpretation of these results must take into consideration that quality-of-life measures were not evaluated and that none of the studies included children under 12."
"Which technique for removing nevi is least scarring
These guidelines for management of cutaneous melanoma present evidence-based guidance for treatment, with identification of the strength of evidence available at the time of preparation of the guidelines, and a brief overview of epidemiological aspects, diagnosis and investigation. To reflect the collaborative process for the U.K., they are subject to dual publication in the British Journal of Dermatology and the British Journal of Plastic Surgery.","Atypical lesions require excisional biopsy. The depth and architecture of the lesion, if melanoma, cannot be determined by shave biopsy, and both treatment and prognosis depend on those characteristics. These guidelines derive from well-designed, nonexperimental descriptive studies."
"Do patients at high risk of Alzheimer's disease benefit from early treatment
Cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) are the only drugs marketed for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Despite numerous randomized controlled trials, the efficacy and safety of this group of medications has not been quantified. Our objective was to quantitatively summarize data on the efficacy and safety of ChEIs in Alzheimer's disease in a format useful to clinicians. We performed a meta-analysis of randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trials of currently marketed ChEIs (donepezil, rivastigmine and galantamine), used in therapeutic doses for at least 12 weeks, from which a cognitive outcome was reported. Studies were identified through 3 electronic databases searched to May 2002, pharmaceutical companies and journals. We extracted the proportions of subjects who responded, experienced adverse events, discontinued treatment for any reason or discontinued treatment because of adverse events. In the 16 identified trials that met the inclusion criteria, 5159 patients were treated with a ChEI and 2795 received a placebo. The pooled mean proportion of global responders to ChEI treatment in excess of that for placebo treatment was 9% (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 6%-12%). The rates of adverse events, dropout for any reason and dropout because of adverse events were also higher among the patients receiving ChEI treatment than among those receiving placebo, the excess proportions being 8% (95% CI 5%-11%), 8% (95% CI 5%-11%) and 7% (95% CI 3%-10%), respectively. The numbers needed to treat for 1 additional patient to benefit were 7 (95% CI 6-9) for stabilization or better, 12 (95% CI 9-16) for minimal improvement or better and 42 (95% CI 26-114) for marked improvement; the number needed to treat for 1 additional patient to experience an adverse event was 12 (95% CI 10-18). Treatment with ChEIs results in a modest but significant therapeutic effect and modestly but significantly higher rates of adverse events and discontinuation of treatment. The numbers needed to treat to benefit 1 additional patient are small.","In established Alzheimer's disease, cholinesterase inhibitors statistically benefit patients with early and moderate disease and probably benefit patients with severe disease. The treatment effect is small, however-3 points on a 70-point cognitive scale."
"When should we treat isolated high triglycerides
To determine the relation between plasma triglyceride levels and the risk of incident cardiovascular disease, the semiquantitative techniques of meta-analysis were applied to 17 population-based prospective studies of triglyceride and cardiovascular disease. Sixteen of these studies represented 2,445 events among 46,413 Caucasian men followed for an average period of 8.4 years, and 5 studies represented 439 events among 10,864 Caucasian women followed for an average period of 11.4 years. Univariate relative risk (RR) estimates for incident cardiovascular disease associated with a 1-mmol/L increase in triglyceride was 1.07-1.98 in men, with a summary RR of 1.32 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.26-1.39), indicating a 32% increase in disease risk associated with increased triglyceride. In the studies involving women, individual RR estimates for triglyceride were 1.69-2.05, with a summary RR of 1.76 (95% CI: 1.50-2.07), indicating a 76% increase in disease risk associated with increased triglyceride. After adjustment for high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and other risk factors, these risks were decreased to 14% in men and 37% in women but remained statistically significant. Three recent prospective epidemiologic studies have also shown that plasma triglyceride and low-density lipoprotein particle size predict subsequent coronary artery disease in Caucasian populations. Taken together, these studies demonstrate the importance of triglyceride levels as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease.","One meta-analysis of 17 population-based prospective studies of triglycerides and cardiovascular disease (including 57,000 patients) showed high triglyceride levels to be predictive of cardiac events, even when adjusted for high density lipoprotein and other risk factors (age, total and low density lipoprotein cholesterol, smoking, body mass index, and blood pressure). After adjusting for these other risk factors, the authors found an increased risk for all cardiac endpoints (myocardial infarction, death, etc) of 14% for men and 32% for women (Men: relative risk [RR]=1.14; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.05-1.28; Women: RR=1.37; 95% CI, 1.13-1.66)."
"What's the best way to treat Achilles tendonopathy
Achilles tendinopathy is a common overuse injury, especially among athletes involved in activities that include running and jumping. Often an initial period of rest from the pain-provoking activity is recommended. To prospectively evaluate if continued running and jumping during treatment with an Achilles tendon-loading strengthening program has an effect on the outcome. Randomized clinical control trial; Level of evidence, 1. Thirty-eight patients with Achilles tendinopathy were randomly allocated to 2 different treatment groups. The exercise training group (n = 19) was allowed, with the use of a pain-monitoring model, to continue Achilles tendon-loading activity, such as running and jumping, whereas the active rest group (n = 19) had to stop such activities during the first 6 weeks. All patients were rehabilitated according to an identical rehabilitation program. The primary outcome measures were the Swedish version of the Victorian Institute of Sports Assessment-Achilles questionnaire (VISA-A-S) and the pain level during tendon-loading activity. No significant differences in the rate of improvements were found between the groups. Both groups showed, however, significant (P < .01) improvements, compared with baseline, on the primary outcome measure at all the evaluations. The exercise training group had a mean (standard deviation) VISA-A-S score of 57 (15.8) at baseline and 85 (12.7) at the 12-month follow-up (P < .01). The active rest group had a mean (standard deviation) VISA-A-S score of 57 (15.7) at baseline and 91 (8.2) at the 12-month follow-up (P < .01). No negative effects could be demonstrated from continuing Achilles tendon-loading activity, such as running and jumping, with the use of a pain-monitoring model, during treatment. Our treatment protocol for patients with Achilles tendinopathy, which gradually increases the load on the Achilles tendon and calf muscle, demonstrated significant improvements. A training regimen of continued, pain-monitored, tendon-loading physical activity might therefore represent a valuable option for patients with Achilles tendinopathy.","During an eccentric calf-muscle training program, patients may be able to continue activity without exacerbating Achilles tendonopathy. An randomized controlled trials of 38 patients compared rest with eccentric training and continued activity and eccentric training for 12 weeks to 6 months using a pain-monitored model. Both groups showed similar improvement in pain and function when measured with the Swedish version of the Achilles assessment questionnaire (VISA-A-S 100-point scale: 0=worst function, 100=completely recovered). The baseline mean VISA-A-S scores were 57 for both groups; the mean scores after 12 months were 85 for the exercise group and 91 for the rest group."
"Do antipyretics prolong febrile illness
In two double-blind trials, volunteers challenged with rhinovirus were treated with aspirin or placebo. Aspirin treatment did not alter the rates of infection or illness but was associated with a moderate reduction in the frequency or severity of some symptoms. The overall benefit in rhinovirus infection was not statistically significant. Aspirin treatment appeared to cause a highly significant increase in the rate of virus shedding in treated subjects. The increase in virus shedding must be considered an adverse event that could influence the course of the disease in the individual and increase the likelihood of the spread of the infection to contacts.","In 2 double-blind trials, 45 adults infected with rhinovirus were given aspirin or placebo for 5 days, beginning on the day after viral exposure (as opposed to the typical use in response to symptoms). Aspirin treatment improved symptoms of conjunctivitis significantly, but did not change the duration of illness. Other symptoms (headache, sneezing, chills, malaise, nasal discharge) were not significantly different. Aspirin increased the amount of viral shedding by 36% in 1 trial and 17% in the other (P<.01), potentially increasing risk of spread."
"What causes a low thyroid-stimulating hormone level with a normal free T4 level
We studied a large population (n = 2575) of unselected ambulatory persons older than 60 years to determine the prevalence of a low serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level, ie, of less than 0.1 mU/L using a sensitive assay, a level suggestive of hyperthyroidism in younger adults. One hundred one persons (3.9%) had a low serum TSH level. About half of them (51/101) were taking thyroid hormone. Of the remainder, 44 were not hyperthyroid did not become so during up to 4 years of follow-up. Forty-one of the 44 euthyroid persons had a serum thyroxine level of less than 129 nmol/L; repeated testing showed a serum TSH level of more than 0.1 mU/L in the three euthyroid persons with a serum thyroxine level of more than 129 nmol/L. Only six were hyperthyroid or became so during the follow-up period; all had a serum thyroxine level of more than 129 nmol/L. Routine clinical examination was not a sensitive indicator of hyperthyroidism and did not permit discrimination from euthyroidism. A low value of serum TSH alone, while it had high sensitivity and specificity for hyperthyroidism, had a low positive predictive value (12%) for this diagnosis; addition of the thyroxine assay raised the predictive value fivefold to 67%. A low value of serum TSH is far more common in older persons than is hyperthyroidism. Low values in euthyroid persons are accompanied by a clearly normal serum T4 concentration (less than 129 nmol/L) or by a serum TSH level of more than 0.1 mU/L on repeated testing. We recommend measurement of the serum TSH thyroid concentration, using a sensitive assay, as the initial step in testing any older person for possible hyperthyroidism. Measurement of the serum T4 concentration or the free T4 index on the same sample would be needed only in the approximately 2% with a serum TSH level of less than 0.1 mU/L; alternatively, the TSH assay in these could be repeated at a later time.","Progression to overt hyperthyroidism is uncommon, occurring in 4.3% of subjects at 4 years."
"How effective are nasal steroids combined with nonsedating antihistamines for seasonal allergic rhinitis
While hay fever is a very common experience, its treatment in primary care setting has been little reported in controlled studies. This study sought to evaluate the patient's assessment of efficacy of an intranasal steroid spray (budesonide) alone or in combination with an antihistamine (terfenadine) against terfenadine alone or placebo alone. A double-blind parallel group, placebo-controlled trial design was used, comparing the four groups. Each group used an active or placebo spray and active or placebo tablets. Symptom scores were recorded daily in diaries over a 21-day period. Overall assessment of efficacy by the 106 patients was significantly greater (P < .05) for budesonide versus terfenadine or placebo alone. There was a 40% placebo response. Budesonide was more effective than terfenadine for all individual symptom scores, particularly nasal blockage, against which terfenadine was ineffective. Adverse effects were mild and transient for all groups. Budesonide alone is a highly effective treatment for hay fever with few side effects.","In an randomized controlled trials of 106 patients, budesonide nasal spray's efficacy was tested against terfenadine alone and in combination; the nasal steroid alone was more effective than the histamine. Combining the 2 drugs yielded no significant improvements."
"What is the recommended evaluation and treatment for elevated serum prolactin
Hyperprolactinemia is the most common endocrine disorder of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. While it can occur in men, it occurs more commonly in women. The prevalence of hyperprolactinemia ranges from 0.4% in an unselected normal adult population to as high as 9-17% in women with reproductive disorders. There are many possible causes of hyperprolactinemia, falling into three general categories: physiologic, pharmacologic and pathologic. When specific treatable underlying causes have been eliminated and in cases of severe hyperprolactinemia, the most likely cause is a prolactin (PRL)-secreting pituitary adenoma. Microadenomas should be treated medically, with a dopamine agonist, if there is an indication for therapy (such as amenorrhea, infertility or bothersome galactorrhea). If there is no indication for therapy, microadenomas may be followed conservatively, as growth is uncommon. Macroadenomas may grow larger; medical therapy is recommended initially, with neurosurgical evaluation reserved for specific clinical situations, such as failure of medical therapy and evidence of mass effect despite medical therapy. In the United States, the dopamine agonists indicated for treatment of hyperprolactinemia are bromocriptine and cabergoline. Bromocriptine is usually given once or twice daily, while cabergoline has a long duration of action and is given once or twice weekly. Results of comparative studies indicate that cabergoline is clearly superior to bromocriptine in efficacy (PRL suppression, restoration of gonadal function) and tolerability.","Eliminating a pharmacologic cause may lead to normalization of SPL, although experts recommend psychiatric consultation before discontinuing neuroleptic medications."
"What is the best treatment for chronic constipation in the elderly
Constipation is a common cause of general practice consultations in elderly people, and laxative use is common among this group of patients. However, there appears to be little evidence to guide laxative treatment in this population. This paper reports the results of a systematic review of randomized controlled trials of the efficacy of laxatives in the treatment of constipation in the elderly. While the results of the review suggest that laxatives can improve bowel movement frequency, stool consistency, and symptoms of constipation, with a few exceptions, the relevant trials have serious methodological shortcomings. However, the review finds little evidence of marked differences in effectiveness between laxatives and, in particular, there appears to be no evidence to support the current National Health Service (NHS) trend towards prescribing the more expensive stimulant laxatives. This is an area where good quality trial evidence is now needed.","Two good-quality systematic reviews looked at 10 RCTs comparing laxatives with placebo, and 10 RCTs comparing 1 laxative with another. The studies generally had few participants, were of short duration, and were conducted in institutional settings. Most lacked power to make valid conclusions. These studies varied in the reported outcome measures, including stool frequency, stool consistency, straining, decrease in laxative use, and symptom scores. The reviews concluded that the best pharmacologic treatment for chronic constipation in the elderly has not been established."
"Which strategies work best to prevent obesity in adults
Obesity in the United States has increased dramatically during the past several decades. There is debate about optimum calorie balance for prevention of weight gain, and proponents of some low-carbohydrate diet regimens have suggested that the increasing obesity may be attributed, in part, to low-fat, high-carbohydrate diets. To report data on body weight in a long-term, low-fat diet trial for which the primary end points were breast and colorectal cancer and to examine the relationships between weight changes and changes in dietary components. Randomized intervention trial of 48,835 postmenopausal women in the United States who were of diverse backgrounds and ethnicities and participated in the Women's Health Initiative Dietary Modification Trial; 40% (19,541) were randomized to the intervention and 60% (29,294) to a control group. Study enrollment was between 1993 and 1998, and this analysis includes a mean follow-up of 7.5 years (through August 31, 2004). The intervention included group and individual sessions to promote a decrease in fat intake and increases in vegetable, fruit, and grain consumption and did not include weight loss or caloric restriction goals. The control group received diet-related education materials. Change in body weight from baseline to follow-up. Women in the intervention group lost weight in the first year (mean of 2.2 kg, P<.001) and maintained lower weight than control women during an average 7.5 years of follow-up (difference, 1.9 kg, P<.001 at 1 year and 0.4 kg, P = .01 at 7.5 years). No tendency toward weight gain was observed in intervention group women overall or when stratified by age, ethnicity, or body mass index. Weight loss was greatest among women in either group who decreased their percentage of energy from fat. A similar but lesser trend was observed with increases in vegetable and fruit servings, and a nonsignificant trend toward weight loss occurred with increasing intake of fiber. A low-fat eating pattern does not result in weight gain in postmenopausal women. Clinical Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00000611.","The Women's Health Initiative studied 46,808 postmenopausal women between 50 and 79 years of age who were randomly assigned to an intervention or control group. The intervention group received intensive group and individual counseling from dieticians aimed at reducing fat intake to 20%, increasing consumption of vegetables and fruits to 5 or more servings per day, and increasing consumption of grains to 6 or more servings per day. The control group received dietary education materials. Neither group had weight loss or calorie restriction goals or differences in physical activity. The intervention group had a mean decrease in weight 1.9 kg greater than the controls at 1 year (P<.001) and 0.4 kg at 7.5 years (P<.01). Weight loss was greater in women who consumed more fruits and vegetables and greatest among women who decreased energy intake from fat."
"Should people with a first-degree relative who died from subarachnoid hemorrhage be screened for aneurysms
Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) due to aneurysmal rupture is a major cause of cerebrovascular disease-related death. This problem could be eliminated by diagnosis and successful treatment of aneurysms before rupture. Recent developments in high-resolution imaging technology have made screening for unruptured aneurysms possible in the general population. Such screening has become widespread in Japan (""No Dokku, "" or brain checkup). As a result, unruptured aneurysms are being identified with increasing frequency. However, the economic implications of treatment decisions for unruptured aneurysms have not been analyzed. Therefore, we performed such an analysis. We used a Markov model to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of screening for asymptomatic, unruptured intracranial aneurysms. The model involved a set of variables describing discrete health states. Each state was assigned a quality of life score and an associated medical cost. A comparison of the expected outcomes was then made between 2 hypothetical cohorts, one receiving screening and the other no screening. A sensitivity analysis was performed by altering the input values within clinically reasonable ranges to reflect uncertainty in the baseline analysis and then assessing the effects on outcomes. Combining the incremental cost and effectiveness data revealed a cost per quality-adjusted life-year of $7760 for an annual rate of subarachnoid hemorrhage due to unruptured aneurysms (rupture rate) of 0.02; this cost was $39 450 for a rupture rate of 0.01. There was no benefit (negative quality-adjusted life-year benefit) for a rupture rate of 0.005, the rupture rate found in a recently published international cooperative study. The risks of surgery for unruptured aneurysms and the discounting ratio used to assess the impact of timing of costs and benefits on future outcomes also had significant effects on the results. Other variables had little impact on cost-effectiveness. The cost-effectiveness of screening for an unruptured aneurysm is highly sensitive to the annual rate of subarachnoid hemorrhage due to unruptured aneurysms. The low annual rupture rate seen in the recent large international cooperative study implies that screening asymptomatic populations to identify and treat unruptured aneurysms would not be cost cost-effective.","A mathematical model for evaluating cost effectiveness of screening for asymptomatic intracranial aneurysms in the general population determined there is a quality-adjusted life-year reduction for presumed islet cell antibodies prevalence rates as high as 10%, given an annual rate of rupture of 0.05%. The average cost was $1121 for those who underwent screening vs $147 for those who did not. The presumed variables of prevalence, annual rates of islet cell antibodies rupture, and surgical mortality and morbidity greatly influenced cost-effectiveness. Screening could be reasonable in populations with higher rupture rates, and if surgical morbidity and mortality decline."
"Can nonantidepressants help treat depression
Several trials have addressed the efficacy of liothyronine sodium therapy in euthyroid, nonpsychotic depressed patients refractory to tricyclic antidepressant therapy. We undertook a meta-analysis of these trials. The MEDLINE database (1966 to May 1995) and published reference lists were examined for controlled clinical trials of triiodothyronine augmentation in euthyroid patients with refractory depression. Quality assessment and data abstraction were performed independently by two reviewers. Results were aggregated three ways: the relative response rate compared with controls, accepting each trial's definition of clinical response; absolute improvement in response rates; and improvements in depression scores, analyzed as continuous variables without a prespecified threshold for clinical response. Aggregating eight studies with a total of 292 patients, patients treated with triiodothyronine augmentation were twice as likely to respond as controls (relative response, 2.09; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.31 to 3.32; P = .002). This corresponded to a 23.2% absolute improvement in response rates (95% CI, 4.5% to 41.9%; P = .02). Improvements in depression scores were moderately large (standardized effect size, 0.62; P < .001). However, study quality was uneven, and results were statistically heterogeneous. Among the four randomized double-blind studies, pooled effects were not significant (relative response, 1.53; 95% CI, 0.70 to 3.35; P = .29), but one study with negative results accounted for most of the intertrial heterogeneity in results. Triiodothyronine augmentation may be an effective empirical method of increasing response rates and decreasing depression severity scores in a subgroup of patients with depression refractory to tricyclic antidepressant therapy, but the total number of patients randomized was small, and additional placebo-controlled data are required for a definitive verdict. Since therapeutic trends now favor other drugs, future trials might usefully examine triiodothyronine augmentation with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or compare potentiation strategies, eg, lithium vs triiodothyronine, for managing refractory depression. Such trials would benefit from much larger sample sizes than those reviewed here.","A meta-analysis of 8 studies with a total of 292 patients found that patients who received T3 augmentation of tricyclic antidepressant therapy were twice as likely to respond as controls (relative response=2.09; 95% CI, 1.31-3.32). The corresponding pooled absolute difference in response rate was 23.2% with a corresponding number needed to treat of 4.3. T3 dosage in the studies ranged from 25 to 50 mcg/day and duration varied from 7 to 35 days. Analysis of data from RCTs alone produced a lower pooled relative response of 1.53 (95% CI, 0.70-3.35) and an number needed to treat of 12.5. A major drawback of T3 augmentation is that little information is available about its efficacy in combination with newer antidepressant agents."
"How can I improve patient adherence to prescribed medication
Efforts to assist patients with adherence to prescribed, self-administered medications might improve the benefits and efficiency of health care.  To update an ongoing review summarising the results of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of interventions to help patients follow prescriptions for medications, focusing on trials that measured both adherence and clinical outcomes. Computerised searches to July 1998 in MEDLINE, CINAHL, The Cochrane Library, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (IPA), PsychInfo, Sociofile, and HSTAR; bibliographies in articles on patient adherence; articles in the reviewers' personal collections; and contact with authors. Articles were selected if they reported an unconfounded RCT of an intervention to improve adherence with prescribed medications, measuring both medication adherence and treatment outcome, with at least 80% follow-up of each group studied and, for long-term treatments, at least six months follow-up for studies with positive initial findings. Information on study design features, interventions and controls, and findings were extracted by one reviewer (PM) and a research assistant and confirmed by two of the other reviewers. The studies were too disparate to warrant meta-analysis. For short-term treatments, one study, of counselling and written information, showed an effect on adherence and clinical outcome. Ten of 19 interventions for long-term treatments reported in 17 RCTs were associated with improvements in adherence, but only nine interventions led to improvements in treatment outcomes. Almost all of the interventions that were effective for long-term care were complex, including combinations of more convenient care, information, counselling, reminders, self-monitoring, reinforcement, family therapy, and other forms of additional supervision or attention. Even the most effective interventions did not lead to large improvements in adherence and treatment outcomes. Two studies showed that telling patients about adverse effects of treatment did not affect their adherence. The full benefits of medications cannot be realised at currently achievable levels of adherence. Current methods of improving adherence for chronic health problems are mostly complex and not very effective. More studies of innovative approaches to assist patients to follow medication prescriptions are needed.","The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews evaluated the published, unbiased, randomized controlled trials of interventions to improve medication adherence that measured both adherence and treatment outcome. Eighty percent follow-up was required, as well as a 6-month follow-up period for long-term treatments with initial positive outcomes. A total of 4762 citations were evaluated; only 19 met their criteria for full consideration. The interventions studied included combinations of patient and family counseling (verbal, written, telephone, and automated); patient involvement in self-monitoring of outcomes (eg, blood pressure); simplified medication regimens; reminders of appointments, refills, and pill schedules; and care provided at the workplace. All interventions were for single clinical conditions including hypertension (7 studies), schizophrenia and psychosis (6), asthma (2), acute infection (2), hyperlipidemia (1), and epilepsy (1). Both of the studies concerning simplifying medication regimens showed a positive effect on medication adherence. Nine of 16 studies on varying strategies of interventions reported statistically significant increases in medication adherence."
"What are the indications for urodynamic testing in older adults with incontinence
This study was undertaken to determine the predictive value of the symptom of stress urinary incontinence and to evaluate the ability of other factors suggested by a published Agency for Health Care Policy and Research guideline for the discrimination of patients unlikely to require urodynamic testing before surgical management. We evaluated 950 consecutive women without advanced (stage III or IV) pelvic organ prolapse who were referred with symptoms of incontinence. Incontinence was recorded by means of standard forms and was characterized as ""any stress loss"" (76.4%), ""primarily stress loss"" (58.9%), ""stress loss only"" (29.8%), ""stress and urge loss"" (52.2%), ""urge loss only"" (13.8%), ""constant and stress loss"" (1.9%), or ""constant loss"" (2.3%). Other variables were assessed by means of a standardized history, physical examination (including urethral axis determination and stress test), 1-week urinary diary, and postvoid residual volume measurement. A urodynamic diagnosis of pure genuine stress incontinence was used as the criterion standard. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were calculated. Logistic regression models incorporating various combinations of stress loss only, previous prolapse or incontinence surgery, nocturia, voiding frequency, urethral hypermobility, and postvoid residual volume <100 mL (the factors recommended by the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research guidelines), along with age and race as predictors of genuine stress incontinence, were constructed to evaluate the predictive ability of the guideline in a subset of 447 patients for whom data on all variables were available. Of the entire population 480 (50.5%) had pure genuine stress incontinence, 134 (14.1%) had both genuine stress incontinence and detrusor instability, 180 (18.9%) had pure detrusor instability, and 40 (4.2%) had intrinsic sphincter deficiency. Fifty-four (5.7%) had normal study results, and 62 (6.5%) had other nonincontinence diagnoses. Among the subjects with symptoms of stress loss only, 10.8% did not have genuine stress incontinence confirmed on urodynamic examination. Agency for Health Care Policy and Research guideline criteria had excellent discrimination (C statistic of 0.807) compared with the sole criterion of stress urinary incontinence only (C statistic of 0.574), with a positive predictive value of 85.7%. Only 7.8% of subjects met all the criteria, however, and 5.7% of these ultimately had a urodynamic diagnosis of either detrusor instability or normal study result. The predictive value of stress symptoms alone was not high enough to serve as the basis for surgical management. Agency for Health Care Policy and Research guidelines improved the predictive value but were applicable to only a small subset of patients referred with urinary incontinence.",One well designed retrospective cohort study of 950 women found that the positive predictive value of clinical symptoms in urinary incontinence alone (74% in the context of a 53% prevalence of incontinence) was not accurate enough to rely on for decisions about surgery. This study supports the need for urodynamic evaluation in most women prior to surgical incontinence treatment.
"What is the best hypnotic for use in the elderly
Patients with insomnia may experience one or more of the following problems: difficulty falling asleep, difficulty maintaining sleep, waking up too early in the morning and nonrefreshing sleep. In addition, daytime consequences such as fatigue, lack of energy, difficulty concentrating and irritability are often present. Approximately 10 percent of adults experience persistent insomnia, although most patients do not mention it during routine office visits. Asking sleep-related questions during the general review of systems and asking patients with sleep complaints to keep a sleep diary are helpful approaches in detecting insomnia. Behavior and pharmacologic therapies are used in treating insomnia. Behavior approaches take a few weeks to improve sleep but continue to provide relief even after training sessions have ended. Hypnotic medications are safe and effective in inducing, maintaining and consolidating sleep. Effective treatment of insomnia may improve the quality of life for many patients.","Antidepressants with sedative effects, such as tricyclic antidepressants and trazodone, have been used for insomnia, but minimal data support the efficacy or safety of this approach. Tricyclic antidepressants may exacerbate restless legs syndrome and periodic limb movement disorder."
"Do calcium supplements prevent postmenopausal osteoporotic fractures
The relation between dietary calcium, calcium, and vitamin D supplements and the risk of fractures of the hip (n = 332), ankle (n = 210), proximal humerus (n = 241), wrist (n = 467), and vertebrae (n = 389) was investigated in a cohort study involving 9,704 US white women aged 65 years or older. Baseline assessments took place in 1986-1988 in four US metropolitan areas. Dietary calcium intake was assessed at baseline with a validated food frequency questionnaire. Data on new nonvertebral fractures were collected every 4 months during a mean of 6.6 years of follow-up; identification of new vertebral fractures was based on comparison of baseline and follow-up radiographs of the spine done a mean of 3.7 years apart. Results were adjusted for numerous potential confounders, including weight, physical activity, estrogen use, protein intake, and history of falls, osteoporosis, and fractures. There were no important associations between dietary calcium intake and the risk of any of the fractures studied. Current use of calcium supplements was associated with increased risk of hip (relative risk = 1.5, 95% confidence interval 1.1-2.0) and vertebral (relative risk = 1.4, 95% confidence interval 1.1-1.9) fractures; current use of Tums antacid tablets was associated with increased risk of fractures of the proximal humerus (relative risk = 1.7, 95% confidence interval 1.3-2.4). There was no evidence of a protective effect of vitamin D supplements. Although a true adverse effect of calcium supplements on fracture risk cannot be ruled out, it is more likely that our findings are due to inadequately controlled confounding by indications for use of supplements. In conclusion, this study did not find a substantial beneficial effect of calcium on fracture risk.","The Study of Osteoporotic Fractures showed no beneficial effect of calcium supplements on fracture risk. This cohort study found that calcium supplements were actually associated with an increased risk of hip fracture (RR=1.5; 95% CI, 1.1-2.0) and vertebral fracture (RR=1.4; 95% CI, 1.1-1.9)."
"Which medications can be split without compromising efficacy and safety
We attempted to determine the accuracy of manually splitting hydrochlorothiazide tablets. Ninety-four healthy volunteers each split ten 25-mg hydrochlorothiazide tablets, which were then weighed using an analytical balance. Demographics, grip and pinch strength, digit circumference, and tablet-splitting experience were documented. Subjects were also surveyed regarding their willingness to pay a premium for commercially available, lower-dose tablets. Of 1752 manually split tablet portions, 41.3% deviated from ideal weight by more than 10% and 12.4% deviated by more than 20%. Gender, age, education, and tablet-splitting experience were not predictive of variability. Most subjects (96.8%) stated a preference for commercially produced, lower-dose tablets, and 77.2% were willing to pay more for them. For drugs with steep dose-response curves or narrow therapeutic windows, the differences we recorded could be clinically relevant.","In a study, 94 healthy volunteers (mean age, 46.2 years) each split 10 hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg tablets by hand. Forty-one percent of the split products were more than 10% off ideal weight; 12% of tablets were more than 20% off.6 Manufacturing regulations require that medication doses vary by less than 10% of the nominal dose."
"Alcoholic liver disease: Is acetaminophen safe
Hepatic injury in alcoholics due to intake of acetaminophen (APAP or acetylparaaminophenol) with therapeutic intent has been reported, but the extent of the phenomenon is not clear, pertinent details of the association remain insufficiently clarified, and the importance of the phenomenon is not widely appreciated. The present report describes 67 patients who developed hepatic injury after ingestion of APAP with therapeutic intent. All were regular users of alcohol. Sixty-four percent of the patients were considered to be ""alcoholic"" or reported intakes greater than 80 g/d, 35% took 60 g/d or less, and the remainder were vague in their reporting. Doses of APAP were in the ""nontoxic"" range ( < 6 g/d) in 60% of the group, within the recommended range ( < 4 g/d) in 40%, and at 4.1 to 6 g/d in 20%. Characteristic feature was the towering level reached by aspartate transaminase (AST) with figures ranging from 3,000 to 48,000 IU in more than 90% of cases. Almost 20% of the patients died. The data on these patients were similar to 94 cases of injury from APAP taken with therapeutic intent reported in the literature. This study provides further evidence of hepatic injury in regular uses of alcohol, especially chronic alcoholics, who take APAP with therapeutic intent. Susceptibility is presumably caused by induction of cytochrome P-4502EI by ethanol and by depletion of glutathione (GSH) because of the effects of alcohol, the malnutrition often associated with alcoholism, and the depletion associated with chronic use of APAP and impaired glucuronidation caused by fasting perhaps as well. The syndrome of liver injury is distinctive, marked by uniquely elevated levels of AST, and poses a significant threat.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","In the 1970s and 1980s, there were a number of case reports and small literature reviews indicating that hepatic injury among regular users of alcohol (particularly chronic alcoholics) who take acetaminophen with therapeutic intent could be a ""therapeutic misadventure""."
"What is the risk of bowel strangulation in an adult with an untreated inguinal hernia
This retrospective study aimed to determine why the incidence of strangulated hernias in adults remains high. Seventy-nine patients presented with clinical evidence of hernia strangulation which required urgent surgery during the period 1979-87. Forty-six patients (58 per cent) had noted a hernia present for at least 1 month before strangulation: 18 (23 per cent) had not reported it to their family doctor, 19 (24 per cent) were known by family practitioners or non-surgical medical personnel to have a hernia but had not been referred for surgical opinion, and nine (11 per cent) had been previously assessed surgically with a view to elective repair. Of these nine, five were considered unfit, three were on waiting lists for operation and one had refused surgery. Thirty-two patients (40 per cent) presented primarily with strangulation within days of developing a hernia. The duration of hernia before strangulation in one patient was unknown. Although an unavoidable number of patients will continue to present with strangulation within days of developing a hernia, the overall incidence could be significantly reduced by greater public awareness of the risks of hernia strangulation and by a policy of immediate patient referral and prompt elective repair.",Another retrospective study found the need for emergent repair peaked for patients 70 to 80 years of age.
"Does group prenatal care improve pregnancy outcomes
To determine whether group prenatal care improves pregnancy outcomes, psychosocial function, and patient satisfaction and to examine potential cost differences. A multisite randomized controlled trial was conducted at two university-affiliated hospital prenatal clinics. Pregnant women aged 14-25 years (n=1,047) were randomly assigned to either standard or group care. Women with medical conditions requiring individualized care were excluded from randomization. Group participants received care in a group setting with women having the same expected delivery month. Timing and content of visits followed obstetric guidelines from week 18 through delivery. Each 2-hour prenatal care session included physical assessment, education and skills building, and support through facilitated group discussion. Structured interviews were conducted at study entry, during the third trimester, and postpartum. Mean age of participants was 20.4 years; 80% were African American. Using intent-to-treat analyses, women assigned to group care were significantly less likely to have preterm births compared with those in standard care: 9.8% compared with 13.8%, with no differences in age, parity, education, or income between study conditions. This is equivalent to a risk reduction of 33% (odds ratio 0.67, 95% confidence interval 0.44-0.99, P=.045), or 40 per 1,000 births. Effects were strengthened for African-American women: 10.0% compared with 15.8% (odds ratio 0.59, 95% confidence interval 0.38-0.92, P=.02). Women in group sessions were less likely to have suboptimal prenatal care (P<.01), had significantly better prenatal knowledge (P<.001), felt more ready for labor and delivery (P<.001), and had greater satisfaction with care (P<.001). Breastfeeding initiation was higher in group care: 66.5% compared with 54.6%, P<.001. There were no differences in birth weight nor in costs associated with prenatal care or delivery. Group prenatal care resulted in equal or improved perinatal outcomes at no added cost. ClinicalTrials.gov, www.clinicaltrials.gov, NCT00271960 I.",An randomized controlled trials found no clinically or statistically significant differences in birth weights between intervention and control groups.
"What drugs are best for bipolar depression
Episodes of depression are the most frequent cause of disability among patients with bipolar disorder. The effectiveness and safety of standard antidepressant agents for depressive episodes associated with bipolar disorder (bipolar depression) have not been well studied. Our study was designed to determine whether adjunctive antidepressant therapy reduces symptoms of bipolar depression without increasing the risk of mania. In this double-blind, placebo-controlled study, we randomly assigned subjects with bipolar depression to receive up to 26 weeks of treatment with a mood stabilizer plus adjunctive antidepressant therapy or a mood stabilizer plus a matching placebo, under conditions generalizable to routine clinical care. A standardized clinical monitoring form adapted from the mood-disorder modules of the Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition, was used at all follow-up visits. The primary outcome was the percentage of subjects in each treatment group meeting the criterion for a durable recovery (8 consecutive weeks of euthymia). Secondary effectiveness outcomes and rates of treatment-emergent affective switch (a switch to mania or hypomania early in the course of treatment) were also examined. Forty-two of the 179 subjects (23.5%) receiving a mood stabilizer plus adjunctive antidepressant therapy had a durable recovery, as did 51 of the 187 subjects (27.3%) receiving a mood stabilizer plus a matching placebo (P=0.40). Modest nonsignificant trends favoring the group receiving a mood stabilizer plus placebo were observed across the secondary outcomes. Rates of treatment-emergent affective switch were similar in the two groups. The use of adjunctive, standard antidepressant medication, as compared with the use of mood stabilizers, was not associated with increased efficacy or with increased risk of treatment-emergent affective switch. Longer-term outcome studies are needed to fully assess the benefits and risks of antidepressant therapy for bipolar disorder. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00012558 [ClinicalTrials.gov].).","A recent randomized controlled trials demonstrated no improvement in bipolar depression using paroxetine or bupropion in conjunction with mood stabilizers (primarily lithium or valproate) compared with mood stabilizers alone. However, the trial also showed no difference in treatment-emergent mania between groups."
"How should you further evaluate an adult with a testicular mass
To determine whether there is justification for a policy of conservative management of acute scrotal emergencies, based on the ability to exclude a twisted testicle or the assumption that there is a ""missed torsion' when the duration of symptoms is prolonged. The case notes of 209 consecutive emergency scrotal explorations, carried out in one district general hospital over a 7-year period, were reviewed. The decision to operate was based solely on a clinical diagnosis, with no information from additional radiological investigations. The commonest finding was testicular torsion (39.5%) with an orchidectomy rate of 22%. Only 5% of scrotal torsions occurred in patients < 12 years of age, whereas 26% occurred in those > 20 years of age. In five of 82 cases (6%) of confirmed testicular torsion, the surgeon did not consider this the most likely diagnosis. With a pain duration of < 16 h, 89% of testes were salvaged, but with pain for > 16 h this decreased to 25%. In three cases the testis was viable after pain had been present for > 24 h. In the absence of supportive radiological investigations, a small but significant number of twisted testes will be missed if conservative management is adopted.","In a study of 209 emergency scrotal explorations, clinical exam by general practitioners and surgeons correctly diagnosed only 92.5% and 94% of testicular torsion cases, respectively, compared with the surgical diagnosis. If torsion cannot be reliably excluded, emergent surgical exploration is mandatory."
"Does bed rest for preeclampsia improve neonatal outcomes
To test whether a policy of admission to hospital for rest is of value in the management of women with non-proteinuric hypertension during pregnancy. A randomized controlled trial. Harare Maternity Hospital, Zimbabwe. 218 (28 first pregnancies) women with non-proteinuric hypertension and a singleton pregnancy at between 28 and 38 weeks gestation allocated to rest in hospital or routine outpatient care. Admission to hospital for rest. Encouraged to rest in bed although voluntary ambulation around the ward was allowed. The women in the control group were encouraged to continue normal activity at home, to check urine each day for proteinuria. All the women were reviewed weekly. Disease progression was assessed by the development of severe hypertension (greater than or equal to 160/110 mmHg), development of proteinuria, need for induction of labour and number of infants born preterm (less than 37 weeks). Fetal outcome was assessed by birthweight, number of infants small-for-gestational age (SGA), and the number of infants requiring admission to the neonatal unit and their length of stay. The hospital rest group had a decreased risk of developing severe hypertension (blood pressure greater than or equal to 160/110 mmHg [odds ratio 0.47, 95% CI 0.26-0.83]). No differences were found in fetal growth or neonatal morbidity. The mean antenatal stay in hospital was 22.2 (SD 16.5), and 6.5 (SD 7.9) days in the rest and control groups, respectively. Hospital admission for bed rest decreased the risk of developing severe hypertension but no improvement in fetal growth or neonatal morbidity was observed. Fetal monitoring at home and continued outpatient antenatal care provided a safe, alternative policy to hospital admission.","A trial was a multicenter randomized controlled trials involving 218 patients between 28 to 38 weeks gestation with nonproteinuric hypertension (blood pressure >140/90 mm Hg). The patients were randomized to 2 groups: bed rest in the hospital but allowed to move around the ward, and normal activity at home without restrictions. The outcomes were measured by masked assessors. There were no statistical differences in perinatal or neonatal mortality, or in the neonatal morbidities of preterm birth, newborns small for their gestational age, or neonatal intensive care unit admissions between the 2 groups."
"How should you document a patient's refusal to undergo a necessary intervention
Due to the distinctive features of the hospital emergency department and its patients, emergency physicians confront special challenges in respecting patient rights to informed consent to treatment. After a brief review of the doctrine of informed consent and of its significance in the emergency department, this article will examine three specific challenges for informed consent and refusal of treatment in emergency medicine: (1) assessing patient decision-making capacity, (2) performing procedures on the newly dead, and (3) making treatment decisions for patients in legal custody.","The law of informed consent defines the right to informed refusal. Thus, each case must establish: 1) that the patient or decision maker is competent, 2) that the decision is voluntary, and 3) that the physician disclosed the risks of the choice to the patient, including a discussion of risks and alternatives to treatment, and potential consequences of treatment refusal, including jeopardy to health or life."
"Does a low-salt diet reduce morbidity and mortality in congestive heart failure
To review the management of congestive heart failure (CHF), with emphasis on older adults. A computer-assisted search of the English language literature (MEDLINE database) followed by a manual search of the bibliographies of pertinent articles. Studies on the management of CHF were screened for review. Studies in older people and recent studies were emphasized. Pertinent data were extracted from the reviewed articles. Emphasis was on studies involving the older persons. Relevant articles were reviewed in depth. Available data about the management of CHF, with emphasis on studies involving older people, were summarized. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) should be measured in all older persons with CHF. Underlying causes of CHF should be treated when possible. Precipitating causes of CHF should be treated. Older persons with CHF associated with an abnormal LVEF should be treated with a low sodium diet and with diuretics plus angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. If CHF persists, digoxin should be added to the therapeutic regimen. If CHF still persists, isosorbide dinitrate plus hydralazine should be added. If CHF still persists, a beta blocker should also be used. Calcium channel blockers should not be used. Older persons with CHF associated with a normal LVEF should be treated with a low sodium diet and with diuretics plus ACE inhibitors. If CHF persists, a beta blocker or isosorbide dinitrate plus hydralazine or a calcium channel blocker should be added to the therapeutic regimen. If sinus rhythm is present, digoxin should not be used. The role of angiotensin II receptor antagonists such as losartan in the treatment of CHF is under investigation.","Sodium restriction is a mainstay of nonpharmacologic therapy for congestive heart failure, although no evidence proves that sodium restriction alone reduces morbidity and mortality."
"What causes a low thyroid-stimulating hormone level with a normal free T4 level
Low serum thyrotropin, in combination with normal concentrations of circulating thyroid hormones, is common, especially in elderly people and in individuals with a history of thyroid disease. We aimed to assess the long-term effects of subclinical hyperthyroidism on mortality. We did a population-based study of mortality in a cohort of 1191 individuals not on thyroxine or antithyroid medication. All participants were aged 60 years or older. We measured concentration of thyrotropin in serum at baseline in 1988-89. We recorded vital status on June 1, 1999, and ascertained causes of death for those who had died. We compared data for causes of death with age-specific, sex-specific, and year-specific data for England and Wales. We also compared mortality within the cohort according to initial thyrotropin measurement. During 9733 person-years of follow-up, 509 of 1191 people died, the expected number of deaths being 496 (standardised mortality ratio [SMR] 1.0, 95% CI 0.9-1.1). Mortality from all causes was significantly increased at 2 (SMR 2.1), 3 (2.1), 4 (1.7), and 5 (1.8) years after first measurement in those with low serum thyrotropin (n471). These increases were largely accounted for by significant increases in mortality due to circulatory diseases (SMR 2.1, 2.2, 1.9, 2.0, at years 2, 3, 4, and 5 respectively). Increases in mortality from all causes in years 2-5 were higher in patients with low serum thyrotropin than in the rest of the cohort (hazard ratios for years 2, 3, 4, and 5 were 2.1, 2.2, 1.8, and 1.8, respectively). This result reflects an increase in mortality from circulatory diseases (hazard ratios at years 2, 3, 4, and 5 were 2.3, 2.6, 2.3, 2.3), and specifically from cardiovascular diseases (hazard ratios at years 2, 3, 4, and 5 were 3.3, 3.0, 2.3, 2.2). A single measurement of low serum thyrotropin in individuals aged 60 years or older is associated with increased mortality from all causes, and in particular mortality due to circulatory and cardiovascular diseases.","Patients aged >60 years with at least 1 suppressed thyroid-stimulating hormone value have an increase in mortality over 5 years (standardized mortality ratio [SMR]=1.8; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2-2.7). At 10 years, the SMR was 1.2 (95% CI, 0.9-1.7). It appears that this is primarily related to cardiovascular mortality."
"What are the most effective ways you can help patients stop smoking
Healthcare professionals frequently advise patients to improve their health by stopping smoking. Such advice may be brief, or part of more intensive interventions. The aims of this review were to assess the effectiveness of advice from physicians in promoting smoking cessation; to compare minimal interventions by physicians with more intensive interventions; to assess the effectiveness of various aids to advice in promoting smoking cessation and to determine the effect of anti-smoking advice on disease-specific and all-cause mortality. We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group trials register and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL). Date of the most recent searches: March 2004. Randomized trials of smoking cessation advice from a medical practitioner in which abstinence was assessed at least six months after advice was first provided. We extracted data in duplicate on the setting in which advice was given, type of advice given (minimal or intensive), and whether aids to advice were used, the outcome measures, method of randomization and completeness of follow up. The main outcome measures were abstinence from smoking after at least six months follow up and mortality. We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence in each trial, and biochemically validated rates where available. Subjects lost to follow up were counted as smokers. Where possible, meta-analysis was performed using a Mantel-Haenszel fixed effect model. We identified 39 trials, conducted between 1972 and 2003, including over 31,000 smokers. In some trials, subjects were at risk of specified diseases (chest disease, diabetes, ischaemic heart disease), but most were from unselected populations. The most common setting for delivery of advice was primary care. Other settings included hospital wards and outpatient clinics, and industrial clinics. Pooled data from 17 trials of brief advice versus no advice (or usual care) revealed a small but significant increase in the odds of quitting (odds ratio 1.74, 95% confidence interval 1.48 to 2.05). This equates to an absolute difference in the cessation rate of about 2.5%. There was insufficient evidence, from indirect comparisons, to establish a significant difference in the effectiveness of physician advice according to the intensity of the intervention, the amount of follow up provided, and whether or not various aids were used at the time of the consultation in addition to providing advice. Direct comparison of intensive versus minimal advice showed a small advantage of intensive advice (odds ratio 1.44, 95% confidence interval 1.24 to 1.67). Direct comparison also suggested a small benefit of follow-up visits. Only one study determined the effect of smoking advice on mortality. It found no statistically significant differences in death rates at 20 years follow up. Simple advice has a small effect on cessation rates. Additional manoeuvres appear to have only a small effect, though more intensive interventions are marginally more effective than minimal interventions.","A Cochrane analysis of pooled data from 17 randomized trials that compared brief advice to no advice or usual care showed a small but significant increase in the odds of smoking cessation (odds ratio [OR]=1.74; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.48-2.05). The absolute difference in cessation rate was about 2.5% (number needed to treat [NNT]=40)."
"Who should have colposcopy
To evaluate risk factors for early cytologic abnormalities and recurrent cervical dysplasia after loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP). A retrospective analysis was performed of all pathology records for LEEPs performed at our institution from January 1996 through July 1998. Follow-up cytology from 2 through 12 months after LEEP was reviewed. Patients with abnormal cytology were referred for further colposcopic evaluation. Statistical analysis using chi2 test for trend, proportional hazards model test, Fisher exact tests, and life table analysis were performed to identify risk factors for early cytologic abnormalities after LEEP and to determine relative risk of recurrent dysplasia. A total of 298 women underwent LEEP during the study period, and 29% of these had cytologic abnormalities after LEEP. Grade of dysplasia, ectocervical marginal status, endocervical marginal status, and glandular involvement with dysplasia were not found to be independent risk factors for early cytologic abnormalities. However, when risk factors were analyzed cumulatively, the abnormal cytology rate increased from 24% with no risk factors to 67% with three risk factors present (P =.037). Of patients with abnormal cytology after LEEP, 40% developed subsequent dysplasia, and the mean time to diagnosis was approximately 6 months. The relative risk of subsequent dysplasia ranged from a 20% increase to twice the risk if post-LEEP cytology was low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion or high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion, respectively. Based on these results, consideration should be given for early colposcopic examination of patients who have evidence of marginal involvement or endocervical glandular involvement with dysplasia. These patients are at increased risk for abnormal cytology and recurrent dysplasia. This initial visit should occur at 6 months, as the mean time to recurrence of dysplasia was 6.5 months.","One study identified 3 risk factors for recurrence of dysplasia after a loop electrocautery excision procedure LEEP: residual disease at either the endocervical or ectocervical margins, and involvement of endocervical glands. The presence of these risk factors predicted a recurrence rate of almost 70%. Because 8% of the recurrences were missed on cytology, the authors recommended colposcopy 6 months after loop electrosurgical excision procedure for patients with these risk factors."
"Are liver function tests required for patients taking isoniazid for latent tuberculosis
After an outbreak of hepatitis in Washington, D.C. in 1970 among a group of persons taking isoniazid to prevent tuberculosis, an isoniazid surveillance study was conducted among 13,838 persons in 21 participating health departments. Age appeared to be the predominant factor influencing the risk of developing isoniazid-related hepatitis, i.e., increasing age was associated with an increasing risk. Drinking alcohol, especially on a daily basis, also seemed to enhance the risk of hepatitis among persons concurrently taking isoniazid. In general, case rates among males and females of the same race, and rates among different races, were not markedly different; however, there were striking differences in the case rates among males of different races. The incidence of hepatitis varied greatly among the 21 cities, but was not unique to any geographic region, nor was it related to a specific manufacturer of isoniazid. The onset, in most cases, occurred within the first few months of treatment. Eight fatalities were reported by the 21 participating health departments, 7 occurring in one city. Black females accounted for 5 of the 8 deaths. This information provides a basis for weighing the benefits of isoniazid in preventing tuberculosis against the risk of its causing hepatitis. Close monitoring for overt signs or symptoms of hepatitis among persons receiving isoniazid preventive therapy is indicated, especially for persons greater than or equal to 35 years of age and those who drink alcoholic beverages on a daily basis.","In 1 series, rates were 3/1000 in those aged 20 to 34 years, 12/1000 in those aged 35 to 49 years, 23/1000 in those aged 50 to 64 years, and 8/1000 after age 65."
"How should you manage a depressed patient unresponsive to an SSRI
More than half of anxiety and depression patients treated with an adequate course of antidepressants fail to fully improve. We retrospectively examined whether treatment-resistant depression and anxiety disorder patients responded to and tolerated augmentation with the atypical antipsychotic, aripiprazole. We report on patients with depression and anxiety disorders, including panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder, who had an incomplete response to a variety of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and who received augmentation with aripiprazole. The primary outcome measure was the Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (CGI-I). In the intent-to-treat analysis, the mean+/-SD CGI-S was 3.8+/-1.3 at endpoint. Fifty-nine percent of subjects received CGI-I ratings of 1 or 2, 'much improved' or 'very much improved,' in terms of their depression and anxiety symptoms at the end of 12 weeks. Several patients showed an early (weeks 1-5), as well as sustained, response to augmentation with doses of aripiprazole between 15 and 30 mg/day. The results suggest that aripiprazole may be effective as an augmentation for patients with persistent depressive and anxiety disorders despite initial SSRI treatment. Because this is a retrospective case review, further prospective studies are required to confirm these findings.","A cohort study of augmentation with an atypical antipsychotic agent such as aripiprazole (Abilify) suggest improved outcomes, but similar studies found no benefit."
"Is therapy based on endoscopy results better than empiric therapy for dyspepsia
This review considers management strategies (combinations of initial investigation and empirical treatments) for dyspeptic patients. Dyspepsia was defined to include both epigastric pain and heartburn. To determine the effectiveness, acceptability, and cost effectiveness of the following initial management strategies for patients presenting with dyspepsia (a) initial pharmacological therapy (including endoscopy for treatment failures) (b) early endoscopy (c) testing for Helicobacter pylori and endoscope only those positive (d) H.pylori eradication therapy with or without prior testing. Trials were located through electronic searches and extensive contact with trialists. All randomised controlled trials of dyspeptic patients presenting in primary care. Data was collected on dyspeptic symptoms, quality of life and use of resources. Twenty papers reporting 23 comparisons were found. Trials comparing proton pump inhibitors (PPI) with antacids (two trials) and H2 receptor antagonists (three trials), early endoscopy with initial acid suppression (five trials), H.pylori 'test and scope' v usual management (three trials), H.pylori test and treat v. endoscopy (four trials), and test and treat v. acid suppression alone in H.pylori positive patients (two trials), were pooled. PPIs were significantly more effective than both H2RAs and antacids. Relative risks (RR) and 95% CI were, for PPI: antacid 0.72 (0.64-0.80), PPI: H2RA 0.63 (0.47-0.85). Results for other drug comparisons were either absent or inconclusive. Initial endoscopy was associated with a small reduction in the risk of recurrent dyspeptic symptoms compared with initial prescribing (RR 0.89 (0.77-1.02). H.pylori test and endoscopy increases costs in primary care, but does not improve symptoms. H.pylori test and eradicate may be as effective as endoscopy- based management and reduces costs, by decreasing the proportion of patients that are endoscoped. 'Test and treat' may be more effective than acid suppression alone, RR 0.59 (0.42-0.83). PPIs are effective in the treatment of dyspepsia in these trials which may not adequately exclude patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. The relative efficacy of H2RA and PPI is uncertain. Early investigation by endoscopy or H.pylori testing may benefit some patients with dyspepsia. The review will be updated in 2004 with an individual patient data meta-analysis of the economic data, and a subgroup analysis by age and predominant dyspeptic symptom.","In a primary care setting, patients undergoing early endoscopy were as satisfied as those receiving empiric antisecretory therapy."
"What nonpharmacological treatments are effective against common nongenital warts
Verrucae are a very common dermatological problem that can be both painful and bothersome to the individual as well as costly to the health care system. In some cases verrucae can be notoriously resistant to therapy. To determine the cure rate, side effect profile, and overall satisfaction with CO2 laser treatment of recalcitrant verrucae vulgaris. A retrospective survey was sent to over 200 patients who had resistant verrucae vulgaris treated with the carbon dioxide laser at The Toronto Hospital (Western Division) from 1989 to 1994. Results: Ninety-two complete responses were received. The overall cure rate was 64.1% at 12 months. There was no significant difference in cure rates between single compared to multiple warts (p = .824 Fisher's exact test). The duration of the wart being present showed no difference in cure rate (p = .801 Fisher's exact test). The location of the wart also had no influence on the cure rate (p = .433 Fisher's exact test). Overall, 71.7% of the patients were happy with the laser treatment and 85.7% would have it done again. The carbon dioxide laser is an effective treatment of resistant verrucae vulgaris.",The potential hazard of aerosolized virus particles from these therapies has not been evaluated.
"What medications are effective for treating symptoms of premenstrual syndrome PMS
To evaluate the efficacy of vitamin B-6 in the treatment of premenstrual syndrome. Systematic review of published and unpublished randomised placebo controlled trials of the effectiveness of vitamin B-6 in the management of premenstrual syndrome. Nine published trials representing 940 patients with premenstrual syndrome. Proportion of women whose overall premenstrual symptoms showed an improvement over placebo. A secondary analysis was performed on the proportion of women whose premenstrual depressive symptoms showed an improvement over placebo. Odds ratio relative to placebo for an improvement in overall premenstrual symptoms was 2.32 (95% confidence interval 1.95 to 2.54). Odds ratio relative to placebo for an improvement in depressive symptoms was 1.69 (1.39 to 2.06) from four trials representing 541 patients. Conclusions are limited by the low quality of most of the trials included. Results suggest that doses of vitamin B-6 up to 100 mg/day are likely to be of benefit in treating premenstrual symptoms and premenstrual depression.","Pooled results of 9, generally poor-quality studies of Vitamin B6 show some benefit. Doses higher than 100 mg/d may cause peripheral neuropathy."
"How soon should serum potassium levels be monitored for patients started on diuretics
Among 54 patients attending a hospital hypertension clinic and receiving the fixed-combination diuretic Moduretic (hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg, amiloride 5 mg), there was a 44.4% incidence of hypokalaemia. The mean drop in plasma potassium level was 0.69 mmol/L (P less than 0.0001), the mean low level being 2.81 mmol/L. Seventy-four per cent of falls occurred within 52 weeks of the start of therapy, 19.5 weeks being the average period between a normal and a low plasma potassium level. There was no difference in the fall in potassium level between male and female subjects, and beta-blockers were not obviously protective, although there was a statistically significant smaller fall in potassium level in females treated with them. The clinical significance of the unexpected hypokalaemia is uncertain; but even with fixed-combination diuretics, it remains necessary to monitor the plasma potassium level regularly in order to avoid complicating situations. The results of the present study would cast doubt on the efficacy of 5 mg of amiloride with 50 mg of hydrochlorothiazide in fixed-combination form in preventing hypokalaemia in this clinical situation.",Penhall and coworkers found hypokalemia in 24 of 54 patients receiving a fixed-combination diuretic (hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg and potassium-sparing amiloride 5 mg). Note that the dose of hydrochlorothiazide was higher in this study than is generally used today.
"What are the risks and benefits of elective induction for uncomplicated term pregnancies
The purpose of this study was to determine whether exposure to an alternative method of care, called the active management of risk in pregnancy at term, was associated with a lower group cesarean delivery rate. Active management of risk in pregnancy at term used risk factors for cesarean delivery to guide an increased use of labor induction. A retrospective cohort design was used to compare clinical outcomes of 100 pregnant women who were exposed to active management of risk in pregnancy at term to 300 randomly selected subjects who received standard management. The 2 groups had comparable levels of prenatal risk. The group exposed to the active management of risk in pregnancy at term exposure group encountered a higher induction rate (63% vs 25.7%; P < .001) and a lower cesarean delivery rate (4% vs 16.7%; P = .01). Findings were similar for both nulliparous and multiparous subgroups. Active management of risk in pregnancy at term exposure was not associated with higher rates of other major birth outcomes. Exposure to the active management of risk in pregnancy at term exposure was associated with a significantly lower group cesarean delivery rate. A prospective randomized trial that involved active management of risk in pregnancy at term exposure is needed to further explore this association.",A retrospective cohort study found a much lower incidence of cesarean section and operative vaginal deliveries among induced vs expectantly managed women at term.
"What are contraindications to IUDs
An overall prevalence rate of actinomyces-like organisms (ALO) in cervical smears from intrauterine contraceptive device (IUCD) users of 3% (79/2, 734) was found, with a rate of 2% and 22.6% for copper and inert IUCD users. Although the users of the inert IUCDs were older, and their devices had been in situ longer, these factors did not account for the significant difference between the two types of IUCD. Fifty-five patients were counselled and given a leaflet on ALO. Fourteen IUCD users with ALO positive smears who had their devices removed had mild or moderate pelvic pain or discharge. Six others who were asymptomatic had the IUCD removed at their own request. All fifty-five patients were re-examined six months to one year later, and a smear was repeated. Only one woman required later removal of the IUCD because of dyspareunia with pelvic tenderness. After removal of the IUCD, and without antibiotic therapy, in 100% (20/20) of the women, ALO colonisation was no longer found six to twelve months later. This applied even to seven women who had had a new copper IUCD inserted immediately after removal of the index device. An overall prevalence rate of actinomyces-like organisms (ALO) in cervical smears of IUD users of 3% (79/2734) was found, with a rate of 2% and 22.6% for copper and inert IUD users.  Although the users of the inert IUDs were older, and their devices had been in situ longer, these factors did not account for the significant differences between the 2 types of IUD.  55 patients were counseled and given a leaflet on ALO.  14 IUD users with ALO positive smears who had their devices removed had mild or moderate pelvic pain or discharge.  6 others who were asymptomatic had the IUD removed at their own request.  All 55 patients were reexamined 6 months-1 year later and a smear was repeated.  Only 1 woman required later removal of the IUD because of dyspareunia with pelvic tenderness.  After IUD removal, and without antibiotic therapy, ALO colonization was no longer found 6-12 months later in 100% (20/20) of the cases.  This even included the 7 women who had had new copper IUDs inserted immediately after removal of the index device.","In an observational study, all of 7 women with actinomyces who had IUDs removed remained negative for actinomyces after insertion of a new IUD."
"What hormonal contraception is most effective for obese wome
To present efficacy and cycle control data pooled from three pivotal studies of the contraceptive patch (Ortho Evra/Evra). Three multicenter, open-label, contraceptive studies that included up to 13 treatment cycles.Setting: 183 centers. 3,319 women.Intervention(s): Three consecutive 7-day patches (21 days) with 1 patch-free week per cycle. Contraceptive efficacy and cycle control. Overall and method failure life-table estimates of contraceptive failure through 13 cycles were 0.8% (95% CI, 0.3%-1.3%) and 0.6% (95% CI, 0.2%-0.9%), respectively. Corresponding Pearl indices were 0.88 (95% CI, 0.44-1.33) and 0.7 (95% CI, 0.31-1.10). Contraceptive failure among women with a body weight < 90 kg (<198 lb) was low and uniformly distributed across the weight range. A subgroup of women with body weight > or = 90 kg (> or = 198 lb) may have increased risk of pregnancy. The incidence of breakthrough bleeding was low and decreased over time. In contraceptive patch users, the overall annual probability of pregnancy was 0.8% and the method failure probability was 0.6%. The efficacy of the patch was high and similar across age and racial groups. Among women < 90 kg (<198 lb), contraceptive failure was low and uniformly distributed across the range of body weights. In women > or = 90 kg (> or = 198 lb), contraceptive failures may be increased. Efficacy and cycle control have been shown to be comparable to an established oral contraceptive.","When it comes to the combination contraceptive patch, the data show a significant association between baseline body weight and pregnancy. In an analysis of pooled data, 5 of 15 pregnancies occurred in a subgroup of women with a baseline body weight ≥90 kg. Less than 3% of the study population weighed more than 90 kg. Specific data for this subgroup were not presented in the study results, so measures of effect cannot be calculated. The mechanism of the decreased efficacy of the combined contraceptive patch for obese women is unclear."
"What is the best treatment for hypertension in African Americans
The effect of dietary composition on blood pressure is a subject of public health importance. We studied the effect of different levels of dietary sodium, in conjunction with the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, which is rich in vegetables, fruits, and low-fat dairy products, in persons with and in those without hypertension. A total of 412 participants were randomly assigned to eat either a control diet typical of intake in the United States or the DASH diet. Within the assigned diet, participants ate foods with high, intermediate, and low levels of sodium for 30 consecutive days each, in random order. Reducing the sodium intake from the high to the intermediate level reduced the systolic blood pressure by 2.1 mm Hg (P<0.001) during the control diet and by 1.3 mm Hg (P=0.03) during the DASH diet. Reducing the sodium intake from the intermediate to the low level caused additional reductions of 4.6 mm Hg during the control diet (P<0.001) and 1.7 mm Hg during the DASH diet (P<0.01). The effects of sodium were observed in participants with and in those without hypertension, blacks and those of other races, and women and men. The DASH diet was associated with a significantly lower systolic blood pressure at each sodium level; and the difference was greater with high sodium levels than with low ones. As compared with the control diet with a high sodium level, the DASH diet with a low sodium level led to a mean systolic blood pressure that was 7.1 mm Hg lower in participants without hypertension, and 11.5 mm Hg lower in participants with hypertension. The reduction of sodium intake to levels below the current recommendation of 100 mmol per day and the DASH diet both lower blood pressure substantially, with greater effects in combination than singly. Long-term health benefits will depend on the ability of people to make long-lasting dietary changes and the increased availability of lower-sodium foods.","An randomized controlled trials studied the effect of different levels of dietary sodium in conjunction with the DASH diet. A total of 412 participants were randomly assigned to eat either a control diet or the DASH diet. Within the assigned diet, participants ate foods with high (150 mmol/d), intermediate (100 mmol/d), and low (50 mmol/d) levels of sodium in random order. In this study, low-sodium DASH diet was associated with additional lowering of blood pressure, an effect that was also found to be stronger for African Americans patients than others. When compared with the combination of the control diet and a high level of sodium, the DASH diet and a low level of sodium lowered systolic blood pressure by 11.5 mm Hg for participants with hypertension (12.6 mm Hg for blacks; 9.5 mm Hg for others), and by 7.1 mm Hg for participants without hypertension (7.2 mm Hg for blacks; 6.9 mm Hg for others)."
"In patients with a previous CVA, do antioxidants protect against subsequent stroke
Observational data suggest that diets rich in fruits and vegetables and with high serum levels of antioxidants are associated with decreased incidence and mortality of stroke. We studied the effects of alpha-tocopherol and beta-carotene supplementation. The incidence and mortality of stroke were examined in 28 519 male cigarette smokers aged 50 to 69 years without history of stroke who participated in the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention Study (ATBC Study). The daily supplementation was 50 mg alpha-tocopherol, 20 mg beta-carotene, both, or placebo. The median follow-up was 6.0 years. A total of 1057 men suffered from incident stroke: 85 men had subarachnoid hemorrhage; 112, intracerebral hemorrhage; 807, cerebral infarction; and 53, unspecified stroke. Deaths due to stroke within 3 months numbered 38, 50, 65, and 7, respectively (total 160). alpha-Tocopherol supplementation increased the risk of subarachnoid hemorrhage 50% (95% CI -3% to 132%, P=0.07) but decreased that of cerebral infarction 14% (95% CI -25% to -1%, P=0.03), whereas beta-carotene supplementation increased the risk of intracerebral hemorrhage 62% (95% CI 10% to 136%, P=0.01). alpha-Tocopherol supplementation also increased the risk of fatal subarachnoid hemorrhage 181% (95% CI 37% to 479%, P=0.01). The overall net effects of either supplementation on the incidence and mortality from total stroke were nonsignificant. alpha-Tocopherol supplementation increases the risk of fatal hemorrhagic strokes but prevents cerebral infarction. The effects may be due to the antiplatelet actions of alpha-tocopherol. beta-Carotene supplementation increases the risk of intracerebral hemorrhage, but no obvious mechanism is available.","In a randomized controlled clinical trial of 29,133 Finnish male smokers, the overall net stroke morbidity and mortality with antioxidants was not significantly different from placebo. However, a trend toward higher rates of subarachnoid hemorrhages was found (relative risk [RR] = 1.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.97-2.32; numbers needed to harm [NNH] = 833), while the cerebral infarction rate was decreased (RR = 0.86; 95% CI, 0.75-0.99; numbers needed to treat = 239) by vitamin E. Beta-carotene increased intracerebral hemorrhage (RR = 1.61; 95% CI, 1.10-2.36; number needed to harm = 546)."
"Is therapy based on endoscopy results better than empiric therapy for dyspepsia
Dyspepsia is a chronic disease with significant impact on the use of health care resources. A management strategy based on Helicobacter pylori testing has been recommended but the long term effect is unknown. To investigate the long term effect of a test and treat strategy compared with prompt endoscopy for management of dyspeptic patients in primary care. A total of 500 patients presenting in primary care with dyspepsia were randomised to management by H pylori testing plus eradication therapy (n = 250) or by endoscopy (n = 250). Results of 12 month follow up have previously been presented. Symptoms, quality of life, and patient satisfaction were recorded during a three month period, a median 6.7 years after randomisation (range 6.1-7.3 years). Number of endoscopies, antisecretory medication, H pylori treatments, and hospital visits were recorded from health care databases for the entire follow up period. Median age was 45 years; 28% were H pylori infected. Use of resources was registered in all 500 patients (3084 person years) of whom 312 completed diaries. We found no difference in symptoms between the two groups. Median proportion of days without symptoms was 0.52 (interquartile range 0.10-0.88) in the test and eradicate group versus 0.64 (0.14-0.90) in the prompt endoscopy group (p = 0.27) (mean difference 0.05 (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.03 to 0.14)). Compared with the prompt endoscopy group, the test and eradicate group underwent fewer endoscopies (mean difference 0.62 endoscopies/person (95% CI 0.38-0.86)) and used less antisecretory medication (mean difference 102 defined daily doses/person (95% CI -1 to 205)). On a long term basis, a H pylori test and eradicate strategy is as efficient as prompt endoscopy for management of dyspeptic patients in primary care and reduces the use of endoscopy and antisecretory medication.","A follow-up study of 1 trials included in a Cochrane systematic review reported on outcomes of a ""test and treat"" vs early endoscopy strategy at 6 years. There was no difference in days without symptoms demonstrated between the 2 groups (mean difference=0.05; 95% CI, -0.03 to 0.14 days). Self-reported symptom tracking and a poor response rate (62%) to patient questionnaires reduces the strength of this study's conclusions. Formal cost-effective analyses comparing the ""test and treat"" with early endoscopy strategy have not been done. A subgroup analysis of 4 trials from the Cochrane review (1 from primary care) demonstrated a significant reduction of the number of endoscopies among patients receiving ""test and treat"" care vs those receiving early endoscopy (RR=0.23; 95% CI, 0.12-0.44). In the long-term follow-up study, fewer antisecretory medication prescriptions were needed by those patients in the ""test and treat"" group (P=.047)."
"What is the best treatment for oral thrush in healthy infants
Recently, two commercial oral nystatin gels have been marketed in Germany (Candio-Hermal, Hermal; Lederlind, Lederle). In a prospective open randomized multicentre study involving 12 paediatricians in private practice, Candio-Hermal and Lederlind were compared with miconazole oral gel (Daktar, Janssen) in 95 infants with oral thrush (candidosis). Oral and rectal swabs were taken on days 0 and 14. Treatment duration varied according to the amount of drug contained in one tube (Candio-Hermal 10 days; Lederlind 14 days; Daktar 8 days). On day 14, clinical cure was observed in 23 of 27 infants treated with Daktar (85.1%), in 15 of 35 infants treated with Candio-Hermal (42.8%; p < 0.0007); and in 16 of 33 infants treated with Lederlind (48.5%; p < 0.004). Clinical relapses were observed in 15 patients (Candio-Hermal: n = 9; Lederlind: n = 6). The overall oral mycologic cure rate was significantly higher with Daktar (29.6%) and Candio-Hermal (20.0%) than with Lederlind (3.0%; p < 0.005 and < 0.03, respectively). It can be concluded that Daktar oral gel is significantly more effective than Candio-Hermal and Lederlind in curing oral thrush in infants.","An unblinded randomized controlled trials of 95 infants compared miconazole gel to 2 nystatin oral gels (gel A: 250,000 IU/g with 250,000 international units administered as single dose; gel B: 100,000 IU/g with 50,000 international units administered as single dose).

"What treatments work best for constipation in children
Constipation and encopresis are common problems in children. Still today, the role of fiber in the treatment of chronic constipation in childhood is controversial. The aim of our study was to evaluate whether fiber supplementation is beneficial in the treatment of children with functional constipation with or without encopresis. We used glucomannan as the fiber supplement. We evaluated the effect of fiber (glucomannan, a fiber gel polysaccharide from the tubers of the Japanese Konjac plant) and placebo in children with chronic functional constipation with and without encopresis in a double-blind, randomized, crossover study. After the initial evaluation, the patients were disimpacted with 1 or 2 phosphate enemas if a rectal impaction was felt during rectal examination. Patients continued with their preevaluation laxative. No enemas were given during each treatment period. Fiber and placebo were given as 100 mg/kg body weight daily (maximal 5 g/day) with 50 mL fluid/500 mg for 4 weeks each. Parents were asked to have children sit on the toilet 4 times daily after meals and to keep a stool diary. Age, frequency of bowel movements into the toilet and into the undergarment, presence of abdominal pain, dietary fiber intake, medications, and the presence of an abdominal and/or a rectal fecal mass were recorded on a structured form at the time of recruitment and 4 weeks and 8 weeks later. Children were rated by the physician as successfully treated when they had > or =3 bowel movements/wk and < or =1 soiling/3 weeks with no abdominal pain in the last 3 weeks of each 4-week treatment period. Parents made a global assessments to whether they believed that the child was better during the first or second treatment period. Forty-six chronically constipated children were recruited into the study, but only 31 children completed the study. These 31 children (16 boys and 15 girls) were 4.5 to 11.7 years of age (mean: 7 +/- 2 years). All children had functional constipation; in addition, 18 had encopresis when recruited for the study. No significant side effects were reported during each 4-week treatment period. Significantly fewer children complained of abdominal pain and more children were successfully treated while on fiber (45%) as compared with placebo treatment (13%). Parents rated significantly more children (68%) as being better on fiber versus 13% as being better on placebo. The initial fiber intake was low in 22 (71%) children. There was no difference in the percentage of children with low fiber intake living in the United States (70%) and Italy (71%). Successful treatment (physician rating) and improvement (parent rating) were independent of low or acceptable initial fiber intake. The duration of chronic constipation ranged from 0.6 to 10 years (mean: 4.0 +/- 2.5 years). Duration of constipation did not predict response to fiber treatment. Children with constipation only were significantly more likely to be treated successfully with fiber (69%) than those with constipation and encopresis (28%). We found glucomannan to be beneficial in the treatment of constipation with and without encopresis in children. Symptomatic children who were already on laxatives still benefited from the addition of fiber. Therefore, we suggest that we continue with the recommendation to increase the fiber in the diet of constipated children with and without encopresis.","A fair-quality crossover randomized controlled trials (31 children, mean age 7 years, with CFC) compared fiber (glucomannan) with placebo for 4 weeks. More children were successfully treated with fiber than placebo (45% vs 13%; number needed to treat [NNT]=3.125; P<.05). Parents rated children as doing better on fiber (68% vs 13%), and abdominal pain occurred less often (10% vs 42%; P<.05). No adverse effects were associated with fiber."
"At what age do patients no longer need colorectal cancer screening
The life tables in this report are current life tables for the United States based on age-specific death rates in 1997. Beginning with 1997 mortality data, complete U.S. life tables were constructed using a new methodology that replaces the abridged life table methodology used previously. The methodology is similar to that used in the decennial life tables. Also, life expectancy and other life table values are shown for ages 85 to 100 years for the first time as part of the annual U.S. life tables. Data used to prepare these life tables are 1997 final mortality statistics; July 1, 1997, population estimates; and data from the Medicare program. Presented are complete life tables by age, race, and sex. In 1997 the overall expectation of life at birth was 76.5 years, an increase of 0.4 years compared with life expectancy in 1996. Life expectancy increased from 1996 to 1997 for each of the four race-sex groups for which life expectancy is reported. Life expectancy increased for black males by 1.1 year (from 66.1 to 67.2), for black females by 0.5 year (from 74.2 to 74.7), for white males by 0.4 year (from 73.9 to 74.3), and for white females by 0.2 year (from 79.7 to 79.9).","The average life expectancy is 11.2 years at age 75 and 8.5 years at age 80. Given the slow progression from polyp to carcinoma, such patients may not live long enough to achieve any screening benefits. Similar reasoning suggests that even high-risk patients (eg, those with a family history of CRC) with repeatedly normal endoscopic examination results may be able to discontinue screening between ages 75 and 80, unless they are unusually healthy."
"What effect do inhaled steroids have on delaying the progression of COPD
The care of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has changed radically over the past 2 decades, and novel therapies can not only improve the health status of patients with COPD but also modify its natural course. To systematically review the impact of long-acting bronchodilators, inhaled corticosteroids, nocturnal noninvasive mechanical ventilation, pulmonary rehabilitation, domiciliary oxygen therapy, and disease management programs on clinical outcomes in patients with COPD. MEDLINE and Cochrane databases were searched to identify all randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews from 1980 to May 2002 evaluating interventions in patients with COPD. We also hand searched bibliographies of relevant articles and contacted experts in the field. We included randomized controlled trials that had follow-up of at least 3 months and contained data on at least 1 of these clinical outcomes: health-related quality of life, exacerbations associated with COPD, or death. For pulmonary rehabilitation, we included studies that had a follow-up of at least 6 weeks. Using standard meta-analytic techniques, the effects of interventions were compared with placebo or with usual care. In secondary analyses, the effects of interventions were compared against each other, where possible. Long-acting beta2-agonists and anticholinergics (tiotropium) reduced exacerbation rates by approximately 20% to 25% (relative risk [RR] for long-acting beta2-agonists, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.69-0.90; RR for tiotropium, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.62-0.89) in patients with moderate to severe COPD. Inhaled corticosteroids also reduced exacerbation rates by a similar amount (RR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.72-0.80). The beneficial effects were most pronounced in trials enrolling patients with FEV1 between 1 L and 2 L. Combining a long-acting beta2-agonist with an inhaled corticosteroid resulted in an approximate 30% (RR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.62-0.78) reduction in exacerbations. Pulmonary rehabilitation improved the health status of patients with moderate to severe disease, but no material effect was observed on long-term survival or hospitalization rates. Domiciliary oxygen therapy improved survival by approximately 40% in patients with PaO2 lower than 60 mm Hg, but not in those without hypoxia at rest. The data on disease management programs were heterogeneous, but overall no effect was observed on survival or risk of hospitalization. Noninvasive mechanical ventilation was not associated with improved outcomes. A significant body of evidence supports the use of long-acting bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroids in reducing exacerbations in patients with moderate to severe COPD. Domiciliary oxygen therapy is the only intervention that has been demonstrated to prolong survival, but only in patients with resting hypoxia.",Some systematic reviews and other randomized trials suggest that inhaled glucocorticosteroids have significant benefit on these patient outcomes.
"What treatment approach to intrapartum maternal fever has the best fetal outcomes
A randomized trial of intrapartum versus postpartum antibiotic treatment of women with intra-amniotic infection was conducted. Intra-amniotic infection was treated with ampicillin and gentamicin during labor (at the time of diagnosis) in 26 women and immediately after umbilical cord clamping in 19 women. Intrapartum treatment led to a lower incidence of neonatal sepsis (0 versus 21%; P = .03) and a shorter neonatal hospital stay (3.8 versus 5.7 days; P = .02) when compared with postpartum treatment. There were no significant differences in the microbiologic results, the gestational age, or the birth weight between the groups. Intrapartum-treated mothers had a shorter mean postpartum stay, a lower mean number of febrile days, and a lower mean peak postpartum temperature than did postpartum-treated mothers; these differences were all statistically significant (P = .05). The treatment of clinical intra-amniotic infection during labor results in improved outcome.","Gibbs et al performed an underpowered, randomized comparative trial of intrapartum vs postpartum treatment of chorioamnionitis, with both groups (45 patients total) receiving ampicillin 2 g IV every 6 hours plus gentamicin 1.5 mg/kg IV every 8 hours. Those women who underwent cesarean section also received clindamycin 900 mg IV every 8 hours starting at cord clamping. In this study, investigators reported neonatal sepsis was significantly reduced with intrapartum treatment (0 vs 21%; P=.03, number needed to treat=4.8), as were neonatal hospital stays (3.8 vs 5.7 days; P=.02), regardless of delivery method. The study had been planned for 92 patients; it was stopped early (n=48) after an interim analysis."
"What is the best management for patients who have a TIA while on aspirin therapy
Many clinical trials have evaluated the benefit of long-term use of antiplatelet drugs in reducing the risk of clinical thrombotic events. Aspirin and ticlopidine have been shown to be effective, but both have potentially serious adverse effects. Clopidogrel, a new thienopyridine derivative similar to ticlopidine, is an inhibitor of platelet aggregation induced by adenosine diphosphate. CAPRIE was a randomised, blinded, international trial designed to assess the relative efficacy of clopidogrel (75 mg once daily) and aspirin (325 mg once daily) in reducing the risk of a composite outcome cluster of ischaemic stroke, myocardial infarction, or vascular death; their relative safety was also assessed. The population studied comprised subgroups of patients with atherosclerotic vascular disease manifested as either recent ischaemic stroke, recent myocardial infarction, or symptomatic peripheral arterial disease. Patients were followed for 1 to 3 years. 19,185 patients, with more than 6300 in each of the clinical subgroups, were recruited over 3 years, with a mean follow-up of 1.91 years. There were 1960 first events included in the outcome cluster on which an intention-to-treat analysis showed that patients treated with clopidogrel had an annual 5.32% risk of ischaemic stroke, myocardial infarction, or vascular death compared with 5.83% with aspirin. These rates reflect a statistically significant (p = 0.043) relative-risk reduction of 8.7% in favour of clopidogrel (95% Cl 0.3-16.5). Corresponding on-treatment analysis yielded a relative-risk reduction of 9.4%. There were no major differences in terms of safety. Reported adverse experiences in the clopidogrel and aspirin groups judged to be severe included rash (0.26% vs 0.10%), diarrhoea (0.23% vs 0.11%), upper gastrointestinal discomfort (0.97% vs 1.22%), intracranial haemorrhage (0.33% vs 0.47%), and gastrointestinal haemorrhage (0.52% vs 0.72%), respectively. There were ten (0.10%) patients in the clopidogrel group with significant reductions in neutrophils (< 1.2 x 10(9)/L) and 16 (0.17%) in the aspirin group. Long-term administration of clopidogrel to patients with atherosclerotic vascular disease is more effective than aspirin in reducing the combined risk of ischaemic stroke, myocardial infarction, or vascular death. The overall safety profile of clopidogrel is at least as good as that of medium-dose aspirin.","An randomized controlled trials comparing clopidogrel with aspirin found a nonsignificant risk reduction of 0.3% (95% CI, -0.03 to 0.9; P=.26) in occurrence of stroke when compared with aspirin for patients with previous stroke, myocardial infarction, or peripheral arterial disease. A 0.9% absolute reduction in combined risk of cardioembolic events was reported for patients randomized to clopidogrel (NNT=111; 95% CI, 57-2454; P=.043), but patients with TIA were excluded from the study population."
"Do insulin-sensitizing drugs increase ovulation rates for women with PCOS
To investigate the effects of combined rosiglitazone and clomiphene citrate versus clomiphene citrate monotherapy on serum insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3) levels in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and to evaluate these therapeutic interventions in the link between hyperinsulinemia and hormonal perturbations in PCOS. We performed a randomized clinical study at the King Abul-Aziz and Cairo University Hospitals. We studied 50 women with PCOS. Clinical diagnosis was based on hyperandrogenism; hyperinsulinism; oligomenorrhea; or amenorrhea, anovulatory cycles, and ultrasonographic findings. They were randomly assigned to two groups of 25 women each. One group was treated with rosiglitazone and clomiphene citrate; the other was treated only with clomiphene citrate. Serum concentrations of luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), estradiol, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), free testosterone, IGF-1, and IFGBP-3 were measured by specific radioimmunoassays before and after treatment. Combined rosiglitazone and clomiphene treatment led to a significant reduction in area under the insulin curve (AUC insulin), whereas clomiphene monotherapy did not lead to this reduction. Both types of treatment induced a significant decrease in LH, LH:FSH ratio, free testosterone, and IGF1:IGBP-3 ratio and were associated with a significant increase in IGFBP-3 levels. These changes were more pronounced in PCOS patients treated with combined rosiglitazone and clomiphene than in those treated with clomiphene monotherapy. Regular menstrual cycles occurred in 72% of the former group and 48% of the latter. Combined rosiglitazone and clomiphene was an effective therapeutic regimen for correcting insulin resistance in patients with PCOS, possibly by reducing IGF1 bioavailability to the ovaries, thus modifying the hyperandrogenic intrafollicular milieu that occurs in PCOS. In addition, the clinical and hormonal responses were better than with clomiphene alone.",A small randomized controlled trials which studied the use of rosiglitazone (Avandia) in combination with clomiphene and reported improvements in menstrual regularity (92% with combination therapy achieved improved menstrual cycles vs 68% with rosiglitazone alone; OR=0.185).
"Which tests are the most useful for diagnosing pelvic inflammatory disease
The usefulness of serum C-reactive protein (CRP) measurement was studied in a population of 152 patients admitted to a gynaecological emergency unit. Fifty-one of 55 patients with PID had raised (over 10 mg/l) (13-270 mg/l) CRP levels with a mean of 76.1 mg/l. CRP was elevated (12-40 mg/l) in 2 of 18 patients with threatened abortion with successful outcome, in 8 of 28 patients with incomplete abortion, and in 2 of 16 patients with ectopic pregnancy. Furthermore, 6 of 35 patients with noninfectious disorders (ovarian cyst, uterine fibroid, unexplained pelvic pains) had slightly elevated (12-59 mg/l) CRP levels. Thus, in this series a CRP greater than 10 mg/l had good sensitivity (93%) and specificity (83%) in the diagnosis of PID. Furthermore, CRP levels became normal much sooner than did erythrocyte sedimentation rate following effective antibiotic therapy, suggesting that it is useful in monitoring therapeutic response.","One study found c-reactive protein >10 to be 93% sensitive and 83% specific in a cohort of women admitted to the emergency department with an acute gynecological disorder. This population had a high baseline incidence of PID, pregnancy, and intrauterine device use."
"Should we screen adults for asymptomatic microhematuria
From 1979 until 1983, 2,005 men underwent routine urological examinations. Of these men 85 (4 per cent) had asymptomatic microscopic hematuria. All men underwent complete urological evaluation. Significant urological disease was detected in 22 per cent of the patients. Therefore, complete urological evaluation can be justified in a nonselected group of men with microscopic hematuria.","A retrospective cohort study of 2005 British men aged >40 years found 85 (4%) with asymptomatic microhematuria. Subsequent evaluation including intravenous pyelogram and cystoscopy found 2 men with infections-1 with bladder cancer and 1 with polycystic kidneys. Benign prostatic hypertrophy, prostatitis, anatomic abnormalities, and stones accounted for the rest."
"Does group prenatal care improve pregnancy outcomes
To determine whether group prenatal care improves pregnancy outcomes, psychosocial function, and patient satisfaction and to examine potential cost differences. A multisite randomized controlled trial was conducted at two university-affiliated hospital prenatal clinics. Pregnant women aged 14-25 years (n=1,047) were randomly assigned to either standard or group care. Women with medical conditions requiring individualized care were excluded from randomization. Group participants received care in a group setting with women having the same expected delivery month. Timing and content of visits followed obstetric guidelines from week 18 through delivery. Each 2-hour prenatal care session included physical assessment, education and skills building, and support through facilitated group discussion. Structured interviews were conducted at study entry, during the third trimester, and postpartum. Mean age of participants was 20.4 years; 80% were African American. Using intent-to-treat analyses, women assigned to group care were significantly less likely to have preterm births compared with those in standard care: 9.8% compared with 13.8%, with no differences in age, parity, education, or income between study conditions. This is equivalent to a risk reduction of 33% (odds ratio 0.67, 95% confidence interval 0.44-0.99, P=.045), or 40 per 1,000 births. Effects were strengthened for African-American women: 10.0% compared with 15.8% (odds ratio 0.59, 95% confidence interval 0.38-0.92, P=.02). Women in group sessions were less likely to have suboptimal prenatal care (P<.01), had significantly better prenatal knowledge (P<.001), felt more ready for labor and delivery (P<.001), and had greater satisfaction with care (P<.001). Breastfeeding initiation was higher in group care: 66.5% compared with 54.6%, P<.001. There were no differences in birth weight nor in costs associated with prenatal care or delivery. Group prenatal care resulted in equal or improved perinatal outcomes at no added cost. ClinicalTrials.gov, www.clinicaltrials.gov, NCT00271960 I.",An randomized controlled trials demonstrated that patients in group care more often had adequate prenatal care (NNT=16).
"How does colonoscopy compare with fecal occult blood testing as a screening tool for colon cancer
To perform a systematic review of the cost-effectiveness of colorectal cancer screening for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. MEDLINE and the British National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database, January 1993 through September 2001. Original economic evaluations of colorectal cancer screening in average-risk patients were reviewed. The authors sought studies addressing the incremental cost-effectiveness of different screening strategies compared with no screening, of different screening strategies compared with one another, and of different ages of screening initiation and cessation. Two investigators independently reviewed each abstract, and potentially eligible articles were retrieved. A four-member working group reached consensus regarding final inclusion or exclusion of articles. One reviewer extracted data into evidence tables. The results were checked by other members and discrepancies resolved by consensus. Among 180 potential articles identified, 7 were retained in the final analysis. Compared with no screening, cost-effectiveness ratios for screening with any of the commonly considered methods were generally between 10, 000 dollars and 25, 000 dollars per life-year saved. No one strategy was consistently found to be the most effective or to have the best incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. Currently available models provided insufficient evidence to determine optimal starting and stopping ages for screening. Screening for colorectal cancer appears cost-effective compared with no screening, but a single optimal strategy cannot be determined from the currently available data. Additional data regarding adherence with screening over time, complication rates in real-world settings, and colorectal cancer biology are needed. Additional analyses are necessary to determine optimal ages of initiation and cessation.","A subsequent 2005 Veterans Affairs prospective cohort study found that the sensitivity for detecting advanced neoplasia was only 4.9% for digital FOBT, and negative results did not decrease the likelihood of advanced neoplasia."
"Which drugs are most effective for moderate to severe depression in adolescents
The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued warnings that use of antidepressant medications poses a small but significantly increased risk of suicidal ideation/suicide attempt for children and adolescents. To assess the efficacy and risk of reported suicidal ideation/suicide attempt of antidepressants for treatment of pediatric major depressive disorder (MDD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and non-OCD anxiety disorders. PubMed (1988 to July 2006), relevant US and British regulatory agency reports, published abstracts of important scientific meetings (1998-2006), clinical trial registries, and information from authors. Studies were published and unpublished randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trials of second-generation antidepressants (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, nefazodone, venlafaxine, and mirtazapine) in participants younger than 19 years with MDD, OCD, or non-OCD anxiety disorders. Information was extracted on study characteristics, efficacy outcomes, and spontaneously reported suicidal ideation/suicide attempt. Twenty-seven trials of pediatric MDD (n = 15), OCD (n = 6), and non-OCD anxiety disorders (n = 6) were selected, and risk differences for response and for suicidal ideation/suicide attempt estimated by random-effects methods. Pooled risk differences in rates of primary study-defined measures of responder status significantly favored antidepressants for MDD (11.0%; [95% confidence interval {CI}, 7.1% to 14.9%]), OCD (19.8% [95% CI, 13.0% to 26.6%), and non-OCD anxiety disorders (37.1% [22.5% to 51.7%]), corresponding to a number needed to treat (NNT) of 10 (95% CI, 7 to 15), 6 (4 to 8), and 3 (2 to 5), respectively. While there was increased risk difference of suicidal ideation/suicide attempt across all trials and indications for drug vs placebo (0.7%; 95% CI, 0.1% to 1.3%) (number needed to harm, 143 [95% CI, 77 to 1000]), the pooled risk differences within each indication were not statistically significant: 0.9% (95% CI, -0.1% to 1.9%) for MDD, 0.5% (-1.2% to 2.2%) for OCD, and 0.7% (-0.4% to 1.8%) for non-OCD anxiety disorders. There were no completed suicides. Age-stratified analyses showed that for children younger than 12 years with MDD, only fluoxetine showed benefit over placebo. In MDD trials, efficacy was moderated by age, duration of depression, and number of sites in the treatment trial. Relative to placebo, antidepressants are efficacious for pediatric MDD, OCD, and non-OCD anxiety disorders, although the effects are strongest in non-OCD anxiety disorders, intermediate in OCD, and more modest in MDD. Benefits of antidepressants appear to be much greater than risks from suicidal ideation/suicide attempt across indications, although comparison of benefit to risk varies as a function of indication, age, chronicity, and study conditions.","Fifteen well-designed trials have examined the efficacy of antidepressants for treating major depressive disorder in youth. All reported the changes in total scores on standard depression scales: the Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised, Clinical Global Impressions, Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, or Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children."
"What is the most effective treatment for external genital warts
Uncontrolled trials indicate that treatment of condylomata acuminata with the carbon dioxide laser is effective and probably superior to conventional surgical treatment. We performed a controlled study of refractory condylomata acuminata to clarify whether this is the case. In this randomised trial 21 patients were treated with the carbon dioxide laser and 22 by conventional surgery after having been treated with podophyllin for an average of 33 and 35 weeks respectively. Five and seven patients respectively had previously required additional treatment, such as an operation. The treatment schedule was equally effective for both groups of patients. No difference between the two groups was seen in numbers of recurrences, postoperative pain, healing time, and rate of scar formation (p greater than 0.1-0.2). Treatment of recalcitrant condylomata acuminata with the carbon dioxide laser did not offer any advantages over traditional surgery, including electrocautery.",Laser surgery is as effective as surgical excision.
"What is appropriate fetal surveillance for women with diet-controlled gestational diabetes
Gestational diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) in pregnancy affects between 3 and 6% of all pregnancies and both have been associated with pregnancy complications. A lack of conclusive evidence has led clinicians to equate the risk of adverse perinatal outcome with pre-existing diabetes. Consequently, women are often intensively managed with increased obstetric monitoring, dietary regulation, and in some cases insulin therapy. However, there has been no sound evidence base to support intensive treatment. The key issue for clinicians and consumers is whether treatment of gestational diabetes and IGT will improve perinatal outcome. The objective of this review was to compare alternative policies of care for women with gestational diabetes and IGT in pregnancy. We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group trials register (12 September 2002) and the bibliographies of relevant papers. The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials was also searched (The Cochrane Library, Issue 3, 2002). Randomised controlled trials comparing alternative management strategies for women with gestational diabetes and IGT in pregnancy. Quality was assessed according to the criteria defined by the Cochrane Reviewers' Handbook. Data were extracted and checked independently by two reviewers. Any disagreements were resolved through discussion with the third reviewer. Three studies with a total of 223 women were included. All three included studies involved women with IGT. No trials reporting treatments for gestational diabetes met the criteria. There are insufficient data for any reliable conclusions about the effect of treatments for IGT on perinatal outcome. The difference in abdominal operative delivery rates is not statistically significant (relative risk (RR) 0.86, 95% confidence interval 0.51 to 1.45) and the effect on special care baby unit admission is also not significant (RR 0.49, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.19 to 1.24). Reduction in birthweight greater than 90th centile (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.19 to 1.61) was not found to be significant. This review suggests that an interventionist policy of treatment may be associated with a reduced risk of neonatal hypoglycaemia (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.86). No other statistically significant differences were detected. A number of outcomes are only reported by one study resulting in a small sample and wide confidence intervals. There are insufficient data for any reliable conclusions about the effects of treatments for impaired glucose tolerance on perinatal outcome.","A Cochrane review found no evidence for or against increased surveillance in A1 gestational diabetes: ""A lack of conclusive evidence has lead clinicians to equate the risk of adverse perinatal outcome with pre-existing diabetes.

"How much does smoking cessation cut coronary heart disease risk
To assess the short-term impact of smoking and smoking cessation measured by self-report and by serum cotinine on the risk of secondary cardiovascular disease events (CVD events). Cohort study among participants of an in-patient 3-week rehabilitation programme following an acute coronary syndrome or coronary artery revascularization. Smoking status at baseline was assessed by self-report (beginning of the rehabilitation programme, rehab) and serum cotinine (end of rehab). Active follow-up was conducted one year later. Subsequent CVD events were observed in 139 of the 967 patients. Both self-reported smoking status (odds ratio (OR) compared to continued smokers: recent quitters 0.96, former smokers 0.83, never smokers 0.54, p for trend 0.04) and serum cotinine (OR 0.59 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.36-0.97) for cotinine-negative compared to cotinine-positive subjects) were associated with the occurrence of a secondary CVD event. After reclassification of all cotinine-positive subjects to continued smokers and cotinine-negative self-reported smokers to recent quitters, this association became even stronger. The OR now reached 0.71 (95% CI interval 0.38-1.33) for recent quitters, 0.64 (0.36-1.11) for former smokers and 0.44 (0.24-0.81) for never smokers (p-value for trend=0.009). The benefits of non-smoking and smoking cessation in cardiac patients are beyond controversy and might even be larger than suggested by previous studies which exclusively relied on self-reported smoking status.","Smoking cessation has also been found to significantly affect morbidity among cardiac patients. Short-term benefits have been demonstrated in coronary heart disease patients after a myocardial infarction or coronary artery revascularization. Smoking status at 1-year follow-up was associated with a significant reduction in subsequent cardiac events (myocardial infarction, ischemic cerebrovascular event, revascularization, or death from CHD) when smokers who quit after an initial coronary heart disease event were compared with continuing smokers (odds ratio=0.71; 95% CI, 0.38-1.33)."
"What is the prognosis for acute low back pain
Knowledge on the clinical course of low back pain presented in general practice is poor. Preceding studies offer a fragmentary view only, whereas further knowledge is important to enable the assessment of the prognosis. The object of this study is to investigate the course of low back pain presented in general practice to enable the assessment of the prognosis. A one year follow up study on the clinical course of low back pain in consecutive cases receiving usual care in general practice. During a period of two years 15 general practitioners from Amsterdam and surrounding areas included consecutive patients with both chronic and recent onset low back pain. After the initial visit, each patient was monitored for a period of 12 months. The follow up consisted of monthly postal questionnaires on the course of the low back pain and the related disability. A total of 443 of 605 patients identified were included in the follow up, which was fully completed by 269 patients. In general, patients with less serious low back pain participated less often or did not complete the follow up. At 12 weeks 35% and at the end of the follow up 10% of the population, respectively, still suffered from low back pain. Both the pain and the disability seemed to diminish quickly after the initial visit, and both seemed to stabilise at a lower level if the low back pain did not disappear completely. About three of four patients, whose pain disappeared before the end of the follow up, endured one or more relapses within a year. The median time to a relapse was about seven weeks, and its median duration about six weeks. Both the pain and the disability turned out to be less severe during relapses. The median time to recovery for patients whose low back pain developed more than seven weeks before the initial visit, was four weeks longer than for patients with more recently developed low back pain at the initial visit. The clinical course of low back pain presented in general practice, for the most patients, clearly is less favourable than expected. It takes more than just a few weeks to recover, and relapses occur within a year in most cases. Fortunately, both the pain and the disability quickly diminish, even if the low back pain does not resolve within a few weeks.","In one prospective cohort study of 443 patients with low back pain, 75% had a recurrence with a mean of 2 relapses in 1 year of follow-up, but only 228 patients completed the study."
"What is the best treatment for pertussis
Whooping cough is a highly contagious disease. Infants are the population at highest risk of severe disease and death. Erythromycin for 14 days is recommended for treatment and contact prophylaxis but this regime is considered inconvenient and prolonged. The value of contact prophylaxis is uncertain. To study the benefits and risks of antibiotic treatment of and contact prophylaxis against whooping cough. The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2004); MEDLINE (January 1966 to February 2004); EMBASE (January 1974 to August 2003); conference abstracts and reference lists of articles were searched. Study investigators and pharmaceutical companies were approached for additional information (published or unpublished studies). There were no constraints based on language or publication status. All randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials of antibiotics for treatment of and contact prophylaxis against whooping cough were included in the systematic review. At least three reviewers independently extracted data and assessed the quality of each trial. Twelve trials with 1,720 participants met the inclusion criteria. Ten trials investigated treatment regimens and two investigated prophylaxis regimens. The quality of the trials was variable. Results showed that short-term antibiotics (azithromycin for three days, clarithromycin for seven days, or erythromycin estolate for seven days) were equally effective with long-term antibiotic treatment (erythromycin estolate or erythromycin for 14 days) in the microbiological eradication of Bordetella pertussis (B. pertussis) from the nasopharynx. The relative risk (RR) was 1.02 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.98 to 1.05). Side effects were fewer with short-term treatment (RR 0.66; 95% CI 0.52 to 0.83). There were no differences in clinical improvement or microbiological relapse between short and long-term treatment regimens. Contact prophylaxis (of contacts older than six months of age) with antibiotics did not significantly improve clinical symptoms or the number of cases that developed culture positive B. pertussis. Antibiotics are effective in eliminating B. pertussis from patients with the disease, rendering them non-infectious, but do not alter the subsequent clinical course of the illness. Effective regimens include: three days of azithromycin, seven days of clarithromycin, seven or 14 days of erythromycin estolate, and 14 days of erythromycin ethylsuccinate. Considering microbiological clearance and side effects, three days of azithromycin or seven days of clarithromycin are the best regimens. Seven days of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole also appeared to be effective for the eradication of B. pertussis from the nasopharynx and may serve as an alternative antibiotic treatment for patients who cannot tolerate a macrolide. There is insufficient evidence to determine the benefit of prophylactic treatment of pertussis contacts.",Six randomized trials failed to show any statistically significant difference between antibiotics and placebo on frequency and severity of cough or duration of pertussis disease.
"What is the best way to distinguish type 1 and 2 diabetes
This study was undertaken to examine the trends in the diagnosis of Type 2 diabetes mellitus among children and adolescents with new-onset diabetes seen from 1994 through 1998 at the three university-based diabetes centers in Florida. Data were abstracted from medical records and patients were categorized as having Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes. There were 569 patients classified with Type 1 diabetes and 92 with Type 2 diabetes. The proportion of patients diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes increased over the five years from 9.4% in 1994 to 20.0% in 1998 (chi-square test for trend = 8.2; p=0.004). There was not an associated net increase in the total number of new diabetes patients referred over time (chi-square test for trend = 0.6, p=0.4). Those with Type 2 diabetes were more likely to have a body mass index in the 85th-94th percentile [odds ratio (OR) = 8.5; 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.5, 28.8], have a body mass index >or=95th percentile (OR = 6.8; 95% CI 2.6, 17.7), Hispanic ethnicity (OR = 6.2; 95% CI 2.2, 17.9), black race (OR = 2.8; 95% CI 1.3, 6.2), female gender (OR = 2.2; 95% CI 1.2, 4.3), and older age (OR = 1.4 for each one-year increment in age; 95% CI 1.3, 1.6), compared with those having Type 1 diabetes. From 1994 through 1998, there was a significant overall increase in the percentage of children referred with new-onset diabetes who were considered to have Type 2 diabetes. Factors associated with the diagnosis of Type 2 diabetes relative to Type 1 diabetes include body mass index >/=85th percentile, Hispanic ethnicity, black race, female gender, and older age.","A patient's age may suggest, but does not reliably distinguish, diabetes types. A study of 569 new-onset type 1 and type 2 diabetic children and adolescents showed that older age was only weakly associated with type 2 diagnosis (odds ratio [OR]= 1.4 for each 1-year increment in age; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3-1.6)."
"What is the role of herpes virus serology in sexually transmitted disease screening
The acquisition of genital herpes during pregnancy has been associated with spontaneous abortion, prematurity, and congenital and neonatal herpes. The frequency of seroconversion, maternal symptoms of the disease, and the timing of its greatest effect on the outcome of pregnancy have not been systematically studied. We studied 7046 pregnant women whom serologic tests showed to be at risk for herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection. Serum samples obtained at the first prenatal visit, at approximately 16 and 24 weeks, and during labor were tested for antibodies to HSV types 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2) by the Western blot assay, and the results were correlated with the occurrence of antenatal genital infections. Ninety-four of the women became seropositive for HSV; 34 of the 94 women (36 percent) had symptoms consistent with herpes infection. Women who were initially seronegative for both HSV-1 and HSV-2 had an estimated chance of seroconversion for either virus of 3.7 percent; those who were initially seropositive only for HSV-1 had an estimated chance of HSV-2 seroconversion of 1.7 percent; and those who were initially HSV-2-seropositive had an estimated chance of zero for acquiring HSV-1 infection. Among the 60 of the 94 pregnancies for which the time of acquisition of HSV infection was known, 30 percent of the infections occurred in the first trimester, 30 percent in the second, and 40 percent in the third. HSV seroconversion completed by the time of labor was not associated with an increase in neonatal morbidity or with any cases of congenital herpes infection. However, among the infants born to nine women who acquired genital HSV infection shortly before labor, neonatal HSV infection occurred in four infants, of whom one died. Two percent or more of susceptible women acquire HSV infection during pregnancy. Acquisition of infection with seroconversion completed before labor does not appear to affect the outcome of pregnancy, but infection acquired near the time of labor is associated with neonatal herpes and perinatal morbidity.",The primary goal for screening pregnant women is prevention of neonatal transmission of HSV. A prospective observational study of 7046 women found that acquisition of HSV-2 during pregnancy was asymptomatic in 74% of 94 cases. No increase in neonatal or pregnancy-related morbidity was seen for those patients who had seroconverted by the time of labor. The main benefit of serology testing during pregnancy has been to identify patients with asymptomatic infection and counsel them on reporting new symptoms for evaluation and treatment.
"What's the best treatment for cradle cap
In an open study, 19 infants with a bipolar seborrhoeic rash were treated with ketoconazole 2% in cream once a day and evaluated over 10 days of treatment. At day 10, 78.9% of patients were almost cleared. Percutaneous absorption peaked 1-3 h after topical treatment, and was minimal. No plasma ketoconazole accumulation over the 10-day treatment was detected. Treatment failures corresponded to histologically psoriasiform eruptions and probable atopic dermatitis.","A small (n=19) uncontrolled study of once-daily ketoconazole 2% cream, 79% of infants affected with seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp and diaper area showed good response by day 10 (no statistical methods reported). Peak plasma ketoconazole levels in this study were only 1% to 2% of those documented after systemic administration."
"How effective is gastric bypass for weight loss
We have demonstrated that obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is prevalent in 60% of patients undergoing bariatric surgery. A study was conducted to determine whether weight loss following bariatric surgery ameliorates OSA. All 100 consecutive patients with symptoms of OSA were prospectively evaluated by polysomnography before gastric bypass. Preoperative and postoperative scores of Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Respiratory Disturbance Index (RDI), and other parameters of sleep quality were compared using t-test. Preoperative RDI was 40 +/- 4 (normal 5 events/hour, n = 100). 13 patients had no OSA, 29 had mild OSA, while the remaining 58 patients were treated preoperatively for moderate-severe OSA. At a median of 6 months follow-up, BMI and ESS scores improved (38 +/- 1 vs 54 +/- 1 kg/m2, 6 +/- 1 vs 12 +/- 0.1, P < 0.001, postoperatively vs preoperatively). To date, 11 patients have completed postoperative polysomnography (3-21 months) after losing weight (BMI 40 +/- 2 vs 62 +/- 3 kg/m2, P < 0.001). There was significant improvement in ESS (3 +/- 1 vs 14 +/- 2), minimum O2 saturation (SpO2 86 +/- 2 vs 77 +/- 5), sleep efficiency (85 +/- 2% vs 65 +/- 5%), all P < 0.001, postop vs preop; and RDI (56 +/- 13 vs 23 +/- 7, P = 0.041). Regression analysis demonstrated no correlation between preoperative BMI, ESS score and the severity of OSA; and no correlation between % excess body weight loss and postoperative RDI. Weight loss following gastric bypass results in profound improvement in OSA. The severity of apnea cannot be reliably predicted by preoperative BMI and ESS; therefore, patients with symptoms of OSA should undergo polysomnography.","Bariatric surgery improved obstructive sleep apnea and obesity hypoventilation syndrome in 2 case series. In one, Epworth Sleepiness Scale scores, minimum O2 saturation, and other measures improved significantly (P<.001) by 3 to 21 months after surgery."
"What is the best treatment for mild to moderate acne
Short-contact application of 0.1% tazarotene gel for acne was devised to minimize local adverse effects. Its efficacy and safety are unknown. To assess acne improvement and tolerability during 12 weeks of short-contact treatment with 0.1% tazarotene gel vs a nonmedicated gel control. A randomized, masked, vehicle-controlled trial. Outpatient facilities at an urban medical school and an affiliated suburban office practice. Ninety-nine volunteers with facial acne were enrolled; 81 completed the study. Thirty-three patients were randomly assigned to each of 3 groups: T + T applied 0.1% tazarotene gel twice daily, T + V applied 0.1% tazarotene gel once daily and vehicle gel once daily, and V + V applied vehicle gel twice daily. Patients adjusted the contact period as tolerated, between 30 seconds and 5 minutes per application. Acne efficacy by reduction in acne lesions, treatment success (50%-100% improvement in global response to treatment) and improvement in overall disease severity. Local adverse effects, scored from none to severe. By week 12, T + T and T + V achieved significantly greater improvement in acne than V + V based on mean percentage reduction in noninflammatory lesions (46% and 41% vs 2%; P =.002) and inflammatory lesions (38% and 34% vs 9%; P =.01), percentage of treatment successes (64% and 61% vs 15%; P<.001), and reduction in overall disease severity (30% and 29% vs 3%; P<.001). Local adverse effects did not differ significantly among the 3 groups after week 4. Short-contact 0.1% tazarotene gel therapy is a safe and effective new method of acne treatment.","In one RCT, patients were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups, each having 33 enrollees: patients in the first group received 0.1% tazarotene gel as twice daily application; the second group received 0.1% tazarotene gel in the evening and vehicle gel in the morning; the third group received vehicle gel twice daily. By 12 weeks, the first and second groups achieved significantly greater improvement in acne than the third group, based on mean percentage reduction in noninflammatory lesions (46% and 41% vs 2%; P=.002) and inflammatory lesions (38% and 34% vs 9%; P=.01)."
"Does treatment of acne with Retin A and tetracycline cause adverse effects
The addition of polyolprepolymer-2 in tretinoin formulations may reduce tretinoin-induced cutaneous irritation. This study compared the efficacy and safety of a new 0.025% tretinoin gel containing polyolprepolymer-2, its vehicle, and a commercially-available 0.025% tretinoin gel in patients with mild to moderate acne vulgaris. In this 12-week multicenter, double-blind, parallel group study, efficacy was evaluated by objective lesion counts and the investigators' global evaluations. Subjective assessment of cutaneous irritation by the investigators and patients evaluated safety. The efficacy of the two active treatments in this 215 patient study was comparable, and both treatments were statistically significantly more effective than vehicle. When compared with the commercially-available tretinoin gel, the formulation containing polyolprepolymer-2 demonstrated statistically significantly less peeling at days 28, 56, and 84, statistically significantly less dryness by day 84, and statistically significantly less itching at day 14. Irritation scores for the formulation containing polyolprepolymer-2 were numerically lower but not statistically different from those of the commercially-available gel for erythema and burning. The number of cutaneous and noncutaneous adverse events were similar for both active medications. The two 0.025% gels studied demonstrated comparable efficacy. However, the gel formulation containing polyolprepolymer-2 caused significantly less peeling and drying than the commercially-available formulation by day 84 of the study.","A multicenter, double-blind parallel study compared the safety and efficacy of 2 formulations of tretinoin gel formulations. These cutaneous irritant side effects, while noted in up to 50% of treated patients, peaked in 7 days and decreased significantly over time."
"What is the best initial treatment of Parkinson's disease
To compare effectiveness of levodopa and levodopa combined with selegiline in treating early, mild Parkinson's disease. Open, long term, prospective randomised trial. 93 hospitals throughout United Kingdom. 520 patients with early Parkinson's disease who were not receiving dopaminergic treatment. Treatment with levodopa and dopa decarboxylase inhibitor (arm 1) or levodopa and decarboxylase inhibitor in combination with selegiline (arm 2). Assessments of serial disability, frequency and severity of adverse events, and deaths from all causes. After average of 5-6 years' follow up, mortality ratio in arm 2 compared with arm 1 was 1.57 (95% confidence interval 1.09 to 2.30), and difference in survival between the two arms was significant (log rank test, P = 0.015). Hazard ratio adjusted for age and sex was 1.49 (1.02 to 2.16), and after adjustment for other baseline factors it increased to 1.57 (1.07 to 2.31). Patients in arm 1 had slightly worse disability scores than those in arm 2, but differences were not significant. Functionally disabling peak dose dyskinesias and on/off fluctuations were more frequent in arm 2 than arm 1. During the trial the dose of levodopa required to produce optimum motor control steadily increased in arm 1 (median daily dose 375 mg at 1 year and 625 mg at 4 years), but median dose in arm 2 did not change (375 mg). Levodopa in combination with selegiline seemed to confer no clinical benefit over levodopa alone in treating early, mild Parkinson's disease. Moreover mortality was significantly higher with combination treatment, casting doubts on its chronic use in Parkinson's disease.",One large randomized controlled trial showed no difference in disability scores and an increase in mortality at 5.6 years when comparing selegiline combined with levodopa to levodopa alone. A re-analysis of this study has not supported this conclusion and found no increase in mortality in patients with a history of selegiline use.
"Are any alternative therapies effective in treating asthma
Asthma is one of the most common chronic diseases in modern society and there is increasing evidence to suggest that its incidence and severity are increasing. There is a high prevalence of usage of complementary medicine for asthma. Herbal preparations have been cited as the third most popular complementary treatment modality by British asthma sufferers. This study was undertaken to determine if there is any evidence for the clinical efficacy of herbal preparations for the treatment of asthma symptoms. Four independent literature searches were performed on Medline, Pubmed, Cochrane Library, and Embase. Only randomised clinical trials were included. There were no restrictions on the language of publication. The data were extracted in a standardised, predefined manner and assessed critically. Seventeen randomised clinical trials were found, six of which concerned the use of traditional Chinese herbal medicine and eight described traditional Indian medicine, of which five investigated Tylophora indica. Three other randomised trials tested a Japanese Kampo medicine, marihuana, and dried ivy leaf extract. Nine of the 17 trials reported a clinically relevant improvement in lung function and/or symptom scores. No definitive evidence for any of the herbal preparations emerged. Considering the popularity of herbal medicine with asthma patients, there is urgent need for stringently designed clinically relevant randomised clinical trials for herbal preparations in the treatment of asthma.","A systematic review of 17 trials, with overall poor methodological quality and a total of 1445 participants, reported significant improvements in clinically relevant measures with 6 different herbal medicines. Ginkgo biloba liquor increased forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) by 10% at 4 weeks and by a more clinically relevant 15% at 8 weeks (significantly greater than placebo, P<.05). Invigorating Kidney for Preventing Asthma (IKPA) tablets increased FEV1 by 30% at 3 months compared with 17% in controls (P<.05). Wenyang Tonglulo Mixture (WTM) improved FEV1 by 30% at 8 weeks compared with a 16% increase in the control group using oral salbutamol and inhaled beclomethasone (P<.05). Dried ivy extract, thought to work as both a secretolytic and bronchospasmolytic, reduced airway resistance in children by 23.6% compared with placebo (P=.036). Tylophora indica (a rare herb also known as Indian ipecac) provided significant improvement in nocturnal dyspnea when compared with controls (P<.01) in a study that relied on patients' symptom diaries. Tsumura saiboku-to (TJ-96) provided patients in one randomized controlled trials with significant, but unspecified, asthma symptom relief when compared with those in a control group (P<.01)."
"Do acetaminophen and an nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs combined relieve osteoarthritis pain better than either alone
Previous studies in animals suggested that a coadministration of the anti-rheumatic/anti-inflammatory agent tolmetin (Tolectin) and of paracetamol potentiates the effects of these two drugs. The present study was carried out to assess whether or not the dosis of tolmetin necessary to obtain an analgesic effect can be reduced when paracetamol is coadministered in a model with experimentally induced pain in healthy human subjects. The effects of tolmetin 200 mg (T 200), paracetamol 400 mg (P 400), tolmetin 150 mg plus paracetamol 300 mg (T 150 + P 300), and of tolmetin 100 mg plus paracetamol 400 mg (T 100 + P 400) on pain threshold to electrical and thermal stimuli and on pain tolerance to electrical stimuli were compared to the effects of placebo under double blind conditions. Each of 20 healthy volunteers received all of the 5 treatments randomised according to four 5 X 5 Latin squares. The results showed that the combination T 100 + P 400 had better analgesic effects than the double dose of tolmetin, T 200, alone, while the effects of P 400 could not be discrminated from placebo. In a sequential t-test the effects of T 100 + P 400 could be discriminated from placebo already after 14 Ss. The effects of T 200, T 150 + P 300, and T 100 + P 400 respectively could not be differentiated, indicating that the dose of tolmetin can be reduced markedly by simultaneous administration of paracetamol without a loss in analgesic potency. Coadministration of tolmetin and paracetamol permits a marked reduction of the dose of tolmetin without any loss of analgesic potency as measured in a model with experimentally induced pain in healthy subjects.","One randomized, double-blind, crossover trial compared single doses of tolmetin (Tolectin, 100, 150, 200 mg) and acetaminophen (400 mg) alone and in combination with placebo in the control of experimentally induced pain (thermal and electrical stimulation). Acetaminophen alone did not differ from placebo in pain control; however, the combinations of acetaminophen with tolmetin provided similar pain relief to higher doses of tolmetin alone. No studies have evaluated the efficacy or safety of acetaminophen combined with rofecoxib or celecoxib."
"Are beta-2-agonists or anticholinergics more effective for treating COPD
The efficacy and safety of salmeterol alone was compared with the combination of salmeterol plus ipratropium and with placebo during long-term treatment in patients with stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In addition, the single-dose effect in response to the first dose of treatment was studied over 12 h. The patients (n=144; age 64+/-7 yrs, forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) 44+/-11% pred) participated in a three-centre double-blind double-placebo parallel group study and were randomized after a run-in period of 2 weeks to receive either salmeterol 50 microg b.i.d., salmeterol 5 microg b.i.d. plus ipratropium 40 microg q.i.d. or placebo for a period of 12 weeks. The single-dose study demonstrated that salmeterol produced a significant increase in FEV1 (peak of 7% pred) and specific airway conductance (sGaw) (maximum of 60% baseline) for > or =12 h. The combination of salmeterol plus ipratropium elicited a greater bronchodilator response (11% and 94% increases respectively) than salmeterol alone during the first 6 h after inhalation. During treatment there were significant improvements in daytime symptom scores and morning peak expiratory flow in both the salmeterol and the salmeterol plus ipratropium groups (p<0.001), with an associated decrease in the use of rescue salbutamol. Improvements in FEV1 and sGaw were greater in the salmeterol plus ipratropium group than in the patients receiving only salmeterol. Thirty-five patients had an exacerbation; 11 (23%) in the salmeterol group (versus placebo NS), six (13%) in the salmeterol plus ipratropium group (versus placebo p<0.01) and 18 (36%) in the placebo group. In conclusion, in patients with severe stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, long-term treatment with either salmeterol alone or salmeterol plus ipratropium is safe and effective. There was added benefit from the combination therapy in terms of improvement in airways obstruction, but not for improvement in symptom control or need for rescue salbutamol.","A 12-week double-blind, double-placebo-controlled parallel group study published in 2000 followed 144 patients (age 64 ± 7 years with a FEV1of 44 ±11% predicted) randomized to receive salmeterol 50 µg twice daily alone, salmeterol 50 µg twice daily plus ipratropium 40 µg 4 times daily, or placebo. Patients were assessed for changes in FEV1, daytime symptom scores, specific airway conductance, and the need for rescue medication. The study demonstrated a significant benefit from the addition of ipratropium to salmeterol in terms of reduction of airway obstruction, but not in symptom control or need for rescue medication. However, no patients were randomized to receive ipratropium alone, so comparison of the relative contribution of the 2 classes is limited."
"How should we treat chronic daily headache when conservative measures fail
Chronic daily headache (CDH) associated with long-term misuse of headache medication is a common clinical problem which is refractory to most treatments. The present study is a retrospective analysis of the effect of drug withdrawal therapy in patients with CDH and frequent long-term use of headache symptomatic medication. One hundred and one adult patients (74 women and 27 men, aged between 16 and 72 years, mean age 43 years) were evaluated 1-3 months after drug withdrawal therapy had been initiated. The mean headache frequency at baseline was 26.9+/-4.0 days per month. Fifty-seven (56%) patients were significantly improved (defined as at least 50% reduction in number of headache days) after a period of drug withdrawal therapy. Based on the outcome of the drug withdrawal therapy, the patients were divided into three categories: group I, those who had between 0 and 10 headache days per month (n = 41), group II, those who had 11-20 days (n = 37), and group III, those who had 21-30 days (n = 23). The mean headache frequencies in groups I, II and III were 5.6+/-2.8 days, 15.7+/-2.5 days and 28.7+/-2.4 days, respectively. Treatment with amitriptyline was offered to patients in whom no improvement had been achieved. Ten of those 22 patients (36%) experienced a significant (> or = 50%) reduction of headache days. It is concluded that out-patient drug withdrawal therapy is the treatment of choice in patients with CDH and frequent long-term use of headache symptomatic medication, and that about one quarter of these CDH patients do not respond to drug withdrawal therapy only.","Medication withdrawal therapy is a treatment strategy for chronic daily headaches associated with the paradoxical induction of headaches by the frequent, long-term use of immediate relief medications such as aspirin, NSAIDs, acetaminophen, caffeine, codeine, ergotamine, and sumatriptan. A retrospective study tracked 101 men and women who underwent a controlled outpatient withdrawal of their overused medications. Headache diaries kept for 1 to 3 months reflected that 56% of the patients had at least a 50% reduction in headache days after removal of overused drugs. Twenty-two patients who had no success with withdrawal and continued to have headaches were treated with amitriptyline. Subsequently, 10 of these patients experienced a 50% reduction in headache frequency."
"Are antibiotics effective in preventing pneumonia for nursing home patients
Vaccination of health care workers (HCWs) is recommended as a strategy for preventing influenza in elderly patients in long-term care. However, there have been no controlled studies to show whether this approach is effective. During the winter of 1994-1995, 1059 patients in 12 geriatric medical long-term-care sites, randomized for vaccination of HCWs, were studied. In hospitals where HCWs were offered vaccination, 653 (61%) of 1078 were vaccinated. Vaccination of HCWs was associated with reductions in total patient mortality from 17% to 10% (odds ratio [OR], 0.56; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.40-0.80) and in influenza-like illness (OR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.34-0.94). Vaccination of patients was not associated with significant effects on mortality (OR, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.81-1.64). Results of this study support recommendations for vaccination against influenza of HCWs in long-term geriatric care. Vaccination of frail elderly long-term-care patients may not give clinically worthwhile benefits.","A cluster randomized trial in British long-term care facilities demonstrated that influenza vaccination of health care workers (61% of 1078 workers) reduced the total nursing home mortality rate (odds ratio [OR]=0.56 [95% CI, 0.4-0.8]) for a drop in mortality rate from 17% to 10% (number needed to treat [NNT]=14.3)."
"Heat or ice for acute ankle sprain
One hundred and forty-three patients presenting with ankle sprains within 24 h of injury were entered into a double blind study. Treatment consisted of a standardized regime of high dose non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication and an elastic support for all patients, who were then randomly allocated to two groups. One group received immediate cold therapy, the other received simulated therapy. Assessments made at 7 days showed a trend in favour of the group receiving cold therapy, although this did not reach significance. It is concluded that cold therapy together with compression may have a beneficial effect but that a single application in the accident and emergency department is not justified when a background therapy of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication is given.","A retrospective cohort study of 32 patients in a sports medicine clinic demonstrated that early cryotherapy (within 36 hours of injury) for grades 3 and 4 ankle sprains, when compared with early heat therapy, resulted in earlier return to activity, as defined by ability to walk, climb stairs, run, and jump without pain. Grade 3 sprains treated with ice recovered in 11.0 days vs 14.8 days with heat. Grade 4 sprains treated with ice recovered in 13.2 days vs 30.4 days with heat. This study also showed that early application of ice (within 36 hours) decreased time to recovery compared with late application of ice."
"Do nonmedicated topicals relieve childhood eczema
In a double-blind, randomized, paired trial lasting 14 days in 72 patients with moderately severe atopic eczema, hamamelis distillate cream (5.35 g hamamelis distillate with 0.64 mg ketone/100 g) was compared with the corresponding drug-free vehicle and 0.5% hydrocortisone cream, and reductions of the basic criteria of severe atopic eczema (delta values of the sum scores), i.e. itching, erythema and scaling, were evaluated. Thirty-six patients in each group were treated, which allowed the detection of a 10% difference between verum and control (confirmatory study). Effects were compared using Wilcoxon's test. The mean sum scores of the basic criteria of the test areas were 5.3-5.5. All treatment regimens significantly reduced itching, erythema and scaling after 1 week. Hydrocortisone proved superior to hamamelis distillate. The basic criteria scores decreased by 2.7 and 1.6, respectively. The delta values of the minor criteria and the global rating of efficacy were also used to indicate the difference between these preparations. Hamamelis distillate cream, however, did not differ from the vehicle. Mean delta values of basic criteria were 1.8 and 2.0, respectively. All preparations were well tolerated. Unwanted cutaneous reactions occurred in six patients, although due to their inflammatory nature and their confinement to vehicle-treated patients, they may not represent true adverse effects but rather a lack of efficacy. The results prove the superiority of low-dose hydrocortisone cream over hamamelis distillate cream, and the therapeutic outcome following this preparation was no better than following the base preparation. The mild, yet unmistakable anti-inflammatory effect of hamamelis cream in experimental models of inflammatory skin disease was thus not reflected by an efficacy in patients with atopic eczema greater than that obtained from the base preparation.",Hamamelis (witch hazel) distillate cream was inferior to steroid creams.
"Prophylactic oxytocin: Before or after placental delivery
To determine the safety and efficacy of intramuscular oxytocin plus ergometrine compared to intravenous oxytocin for prevention of postpartum haemorrhage, and the significance of administration at the end of the second stage of labour compared with that after the third stage. A prospective cohort study. A university affiliated tertiary medical centre. Two thousand one hundred and eighty-nine women delivering singletons during 40 consecutive weeks. Postpartum haemorrhage (> 500 ml), prolonged third stage (> 30 min), retained placenta (> 60 min), elevated blood pressure (systolic > 150 mmHg, diastolic > 100 mmHg). The rate of postpartum haemorrhage was not significantly different for oxytocin-ergometrine compared with oxytocin, when administered at the end of the second stage of labour (odds ratio 1.10, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.75-1.61) or after the third stage (odds ratio 0.95, 95% CI 0.68-1.34). The patients receiving oxytocics at the end of the second stage of labour had significantly lower rates of postpartum haemorrhage, for both oxytocin-ergometrine (odds ratio 0.69, 95% CI 0.49-0.98) and oxytocin (odds ratio 0.60, 95% CI 0.41-0.87), compared with those treated after the third stage. Administration of oxytocin alone is as effective as the use of oxytocin plus ergometrine in the prevention of postpartum haemorrhage, but associated with a significantly lower rate of unpleasant maternal side effects. Oxytocics administered after delivery of the fetal head compared with after the placental expulsion are associated with a significantly lower rate of postpartum haemorrhage.","A prospective cohort study concluded that oxytocin is more effective in reducing postpartum hemorrhage when given before placental delivery (after delivery of the anterior shoulder and head, respectively). The study was neither blinded nor controlled for nonpharmacologic interventions, however."
"What is the best treatment for nocturnal enuresis in children
Enuresis (bedwetting) is a socially disruptive and stressful condition which affects around 15-20% of five year olds, and up to 2% of young adults. To assess the effects of alarm interventions on nocturnal enuresis in children, and to compare alarms with other interventions. We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group trials register (December 2002) and the reference lists of relevant articles. Date of the most recent searches: December 2002. All randomised or quasi-randomised trials of alarm interventions for nocturnal enuresis in children were included, except those focused solely on daytime wetting. Comparison interventions included no treatment, simple and complex behavioural methods, desmopressin, tricyclics, and miscellaneous other methods. Two reviewers independently assessed the quality of the eligible trials, and extracted data. Fifty three trials met the inclusion criteria, involving 2862 children. The quality of many trials was poor, and evidence for many comparisons was inadequate. Most alarms used audio methods. Compared to no treatment, about two thirds of children became dry during alarm use (RR for failure 0.36, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.43). Nearly half who persisted with alarm use remained dry after treatment finished, compared to almost none after no treatment (RR of failure or relapse 45/81 (55%) vs 80/81 (99%), RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.68). There was insufficient evidence to draw conclusions about different types of alarm, or about how alarms compare to other behavioural interventions. Relapse rates were lower when overlearning was added to alarm treatment (RR 1.92, 95% CI 1.27 to 2.92). Penalties for wet beds appeared to be counter-productive. Alarms using electric shocks were unacceptable to children or their parents. Although desmopressin may have a more immediate effect, alarms appear more effective by the end of a course of treatment (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.99) and there was limited evidence of greater long-term success (RR 4/22 (18%) vs 16/24 (67%),RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.69). Alarms were better than tricyclics during treatment (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.88) and afterwards (7/12 (58%) vs 12/12 (100%), RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.94). Alarm interventions are an effective treatment for nocturnal bedwetting in children. Alarms appear more effective than desmopressin or tricyclics by the end of treatment, and subsequently. Overlearning (giving extra fluids at bedtime after successfully becoming dry using an alarm) and avoiding penalties may further reduce the relapse rate. Better quality research comparing alarms with other treatments is needed, including follow-up to determine relapse rates.","The Cochrane Incontinence Group Trials demonstrated that enuresis alarms led to nearly 4 fewer wet nights per week compared with no treatment or placebo (weighted mean difference [WMD]=-3.65; 95% confidence interval [CI], -4.52 to -2.78). The relative risk of failure was 0.36 compared with placebo (95% CI, 0.26 to 0.40). The number needed to treat (NNT) to achieve 14 consecutive dry nights is 2. About half the children relapse after stopping treatment, compared with nearly all children after control interventions (55% vs 99%). Evidence is insufficient to say whether the addition of dry bed training (scheduled awakenings, cleanliness training, social reinforcement, positive practice) improves the outcomes. Alarms that wake the child immediately (vs a time delay) and alarms that wake the child (instead of the parents) were slightly more effective."
"How beneficial are thiazolidinediones for diabetes mellitus
Oral agents are the mainstay of pharmacologic treatment for type 2 diabetes, and physicians now have a number of agents to choose from. However, more choices translate into more complex decision making. Many patients with diabetes have associated comorbidities, and most diabetic patients will require more than 1 agent to achieve good glycemic control. This article illustrates several of the pharmacologic approaches to type 2 diabetes through 4 situations that use principles of evidence-based medicine. The scenarios also highlight some of the difficulties in choosing the optimal pharmacologic treatment regimen for individual patients. Physicians should also recognize that type 2 diabetes is a multisystem disorder that requires multidisciplinary care, including education and ongoing counseling for effective patient self-management of the disease. Finally, patient preferences are a vital component of informed decision making for pharmacologic treatment of diabetes.","Patients with New York Heart Association class III or IV heart failure should not use thiazolidinediones. In addition, thiazolidinediones cost considerably more than sulfonylureas and metformin."
"Does heat or cold work better for acute muscle strain
The use of ice or cryotherapy in the management of acute soft tissue injuries is widely accepted and widely practised. This review was conducted to examine the medical literature to investigate if there is evidence to support an improvement in clinical outcome following the use of ice or cryotherapy. A comprehensive literature search was performed and all human and animal trials or systematic reviews pertaining to soft tissue trauma, ice or cryotherapy were assessed. The clinically relevant outcome measures were (1) a reduction in pain; (2) a reduction in swelling or oedema; (3) improved function; or (4) return to participation in normal activity. Six relevant trials in humans were identified, four of which lacked randomisation and blinding. There were two well conducted randomised controlled trials, one showing supportive evidence for the use of a cooling gel and the other not reaching statistical significance. Four animal studies showed that modest cooling reduced oedema but excessive or prolonged cooling is damaging. There were two systematic reviews, one of which was inconclusive and the other suggested that ice may hasten return to participation. There is insufficient evidence to suggest that cryotherapy improves clinical outcome in the management of soft tissue injuries.","A 2007 review evaluated 66 publications and found only 1 randomized controlled trial conducted on humans. The intervention in this trial involved applying cold gel 4 times a day for the first 14 days after the injury. The control group received a room-temperature gel application; neither group was aware of the temperature differential. The study found significant reduction in pain at rest, pain with movement, and functional disability at intervals of 7, 14, and 28 days postinjury (P<.001) among patients receiving cold-gel applications. Patients receiving cold-gel treatment also reported increased satisfaction with treatment compared with the controls. At 28 days, cold-gel treatment patients scored 71 on a 100-point satisfaction scale compared with 44 for controls (P<.001). Inconclusive results or significant design flaws limited the validity of all other trials cited in this review."
"Is there much risk in using fluoroquinolones in children
The French system of drug surveillance has analysed the notifications of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) to fluoroquinolones since they were launched. Their frequency ranges from 1/15,000 to 1/208,000 case per days of treatment. Cutaneous diseases and tendon disorders predominate in France whereas cutaneous effects and neuropsychiatric disorders are predominant in the UK; tendon disorders take up only the 5th position. Among the most unexpected ADRs are the following: -shock represents 33 of the anaphylaxis reactions which range from 1/5.6 x 10(6) to 1/4.4 x 10(5) case per days of treatment. -acute renal failure is rare: one case/80,000 patients treated by ciprofloxacin to 1/320,000 by norfloxacin. The pathophysiology is not well known. Tendon ruptures represent 81 cases for 921 notifications of tendon disorders which are related in decreasing order to pefloxacin 1/23,130 case per days of treatment, ofloxacin, norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin 1/779,600 case per days of treatment. Age and corticosteroids increase the risk of tendon rupture.","A 1996 study reported the incidence of tendon disorders related to fluoroquinolones using drug surveillance data from the general population. The average age of the patients was 55 years. The author estimated the risk of tendon rupture associated with norfloxacin or ofloxacin to be 1 case per 23,130 days of treatment and only 1 case per 779,600 days of ciprofloxacin treatment. The estimated risk would likely be even lower in children, the author noted, because the risk of tendon rupture increases with age."
"What is the best treatment for hypertension in African Americans
The presence of hypertension in individual patients confers significant risk in terms of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, stroke and congestive heart failure. However, it is also a modifiable risk factor, as risk may be decreased through either lifestyle changes or pharmacotherapy to reduce the elevated blood pressure. Over the past 3 decades, there has been strenuous debate among clinical scientists regarding the role played by racial background in both the pathogenesis and response to pharmacotherapy. A number of studies, such as the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) have demonstrated a higher prevalence of hypertension in black populations. The Hispanic Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (HHANES) suggested that the prevalence of hypertension in Hispanics of Caribbean descent was similar to that of African Americans, while Mexican Americans had lower rates of the disease. It appears that the pathophysiological consequences of elevated blood pressure may also be more severe in black patients. Thus, these patients will have a worse prognosis than their white counterparts at any given blood pressure level. The incidence of end-stage renal disease has been reported to be as much as 17 times more common in African American patients. A number of individual factors have been postulated for these differences including increased sodium intake, differences in sodium handling, decreased potassium intake, decreased calcium intake, elevated fasting insulin levels, lower levels of plasma renin activity and urinary kallikrein excretion. These differences in prevalence and pathophysiology have resulted in recommendations for differential therapeutic approaches in the treatment of hypertension. A major trial conducted in the Veteran Affairs Medical Centers in the USA noted that African Americans are generally more responsive to diuretics and calcium channel blockers than to ACE inhibitors or beta-blockers. However, it has been reported that this resistance may be overcome by increasing the dose of these agents. It has been postulated that these differences may be related to lower plasma renin activity noted in the black population, since diuretics and calcium channel blockers appear to be better suited to this population. These differential therapeutic recommendations will be reviewed in light of our current knowledge of the disease.",A review of multiple studies demonstrated that African Americans may be less responsive to monotherapy with angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors.
"What is the role of tacrolimus and pimecrolimus in atopic dermatitis
SDZ ASM 981 is a selective inhibitor of the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines from T cells and mast cells in vitro. It is the first ascomycin macrolactam derivative under development for the treatment of inflammatory skin diseases. This study was designed to determine the safety and efficacy of SDZ ASM 981 cream at concentrations of 0.05%, 0.2%, 0.6% and 1.0% in the treatment of patients with atopic dermatitis and to select the concentration to be used in phase III studies. This was a double-blind, randomized, parallel-group, multicentre dose-finding study. A total of 260 patients were randomly assigned to treatment with SDZ ASM 981 cream at concentrations of 0.05%, 0.2%, 0.6%, or 1.0%, matching vehicle cream, or the internal control 0.1% betamethasone-17-valerate cream (BMV). Treatment was given twice daily for up to 3 weeks. A clear dose-response relationship for SDZ ASM 981 was evident, with 0.2%, 0.6% and 1.0% SDZ ASM 981 creams all being significantly more effective than vehicle (P = 0.041, 0.001 and 0.008, respectively) in terms of baseline to end-point changes in the Eczema Area Severity Index (EASI) and pruritus score. The 1.0% cream was the most effective SDZ ASM 981 concentration. BMV was more effective than the SDZ ASM 981 creams tested in this study. It appears that the efficacy plateau was not reached with the SDZ ASM 981 creams within 3 weeks treatment. SDZ ASM 981 was well tolerated. Burning or a feeling of warmth were the only adverse events reported more frequently in the 0.6% and 1.0% SDZ ASM 981 treatment groups than in the vehicle treatment group (42.9%, 48.9% and 34.9%, respectively). Few systemic adverse events were reported during the study (headache was the most frequent systemic event reported by 15 of 252 patients) and none was considered to be related to treatment. The local tolerability profile of the 1.0% cream was similar to that of the lower concentrations. 1.0% SDZ ASM 981 cream, which was shown to be safe, well tolerated and the most effective concentration in this study, was selected as the concentration to be further developed in phase III studies.","A study compared pimecrolimus 1% with betamethasone valerate 0.1% (a potent corticosteroid) in a study of 87 patients. At the end of 3 weeks, the pimecrolimus 1% cream was significantly less effective than betamethasone valerate 0.1% (NNT=4)."
"What is the best regimen for newly diagnosed hypertension
Antihypertensive therapy is well established to reduce hypertension-related morbidity and mortality, but the optimal first-step therapy is unknown. To determine whether treatment with a calcium channel blocker or an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor lowers the incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD) or other cardiovascular disease (CVD) events vs treatment with a diuretic. The Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT), a randomized, double-blind, active-controlled clinical trial conducted from February 1994 through March 2002. A total of 33 357 participants aged 55 years or older with hypertension and at least 1 other CHD risk factor from 623 North American centers. Participants were randomly assigned to receive chlorthalidone, 12.5 to 25 mg/d (n = 15 255); amlodipine, 2.5 to 10 mg/d (n = 9048); or lisinopril, 10 to 40 mg/d (n = 9054) for planned follow-up of approximately 4 to 8 years. The primary outcome was combined fatal CHD or nonfatal myocardial infarction, analyzed by intent-to-treat. Secondary outcomes were all-cause mortality, stroke, combined CHD (primary outcome, coronary revascularization, or angina with hospitalization), and combined CVD (combined CHD, stroke, treated angina without hospitalization, heart failure [HF], and peripheral arterial disease). Mean follow-up was 4.9 years. The primary outcome occurred in 2956 participants, with no difference between treatments. Compared with chlorthalidone (6-year rate, 11.5%), the relative risks (RRs) were 0.98 (95% CI, 0.90-1.07) for amlodipine (6-year rate, 11.3%) and 0.99 (95% CI, 0.91-1.08) for lisinopril (6-year rate, 11.4%). Likewise, all-cause mortality did not differ between groups. Five-year systolic blood pressures were significantly higher in the amlodipine (0.8 mm Hg, P =.03) and lisinopril (2 mm Hg, P<.001) groups compared with chlorthalidone, and 5-year diastolic blood pressure was significantly lower with amlodipine (0.8 mm Hg, P<.001). For amlodipine vs chlorthalidone, secondary outcomes were similar except for a higher 6-year rate of HF with amlodipine (10.2% vs 7.7%; RR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.25-1.52). For lisinopril vs chlorthalidone, lisinopril had higher 6-year rates of combined CVD (33.3% vs 30.9%; RR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.05-1.16); stroke (6.3% vs 5.6%; RR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.02-1.30); and HF (8.7% vs 7.7%; RR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.07-1.31). Thiazide-type diuretics are superior in preventing 1 or more major forms of CVD and are less expensive. They should be preferred for first-step antihypertensive therapy.","Results from the largest antihypertensive clinical trial, the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT), were included in this meta-analysis. Although these data showed no differences between drug therapies in total and cardiovascular disease mortality, low-dose diuretics reduced certain cardiovascular endpoints (ie, heart failure, stroke, cardiovascular disease events) more than other drug therapies."
"What is the best approach to a solitary pulmonary nodule identified by chest x-ray
More than 150,00 patients a year present to their physicians with the diagnostic dilemma of a solitary pulmonary nodule (SPN) found either on chest radiography or chest CT. A thoughtful and timely workup of this finding is essential if lung cancer is to be recognized early and the chance for cure optimized. Based on the literature to date, recommendations are made for appropriate imaging modalities and diagnostic testing, as well as indications for obtaining preoperative tissue diagnosis for the patient with an SPN.","Although early detection of malignancy portends a major improvement in survival (up to 75% at 5 years following surgical resection of stage intra-articular disease), most lung cancers progress asymptomatically until quite advanced."

"What is the best strategy for impaired glucose tolerance in nonpregnant adults
Type 2 diabetes affects approximately 8 percent of adults in the United States. Some risk factors--elevated plasma glucose concentrations in the fasting state and after an oral glucose load, overweight, and a sedentary lifestyle--are potentially reversible. We hypothesized that modifying these factors with a lifestyle-intervention program or the administration of metformin would prevent or delay the development of diabetes. We randomly assigned 3234 nondiabetic persons with elevated fasting and post-load plasma glucose concentrations to placebo, metformin (850 mg twice daily), or a lifestyle-modification program with the goals of at least a 7 percent weight loss and at least 150 minutes of physical activity per week. The mean age of the participants was 51 years, and the mean body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 34.0; 68 percent were women, and 45 percent were members of minority groups. The average follow-up was 2.8 years. The incidence of diabetes was 11.0, 7.8, and 4.8 cases per 100 person-years in the placebo, metformin, and lifestyle groups, respectively. The lifestyle intervention reduced the incidence by 58 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 48 to 66 percent) and metformin by 31 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 17 to 43 percent), as compared with placebo; the lifestyle intervention was significantly more effective than metformin. To prevent one case of diabetes during a period of three years, 6.9 persons would have to participate in the lifestyle-intervention program, and 13.9 would have to receive metformin. Lifestyle changes and treatment with metformin both reduced the incidence of diabetes in persons at high risk. The lifestyle intervention was more effective than metformin.","In the US Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), 3234 patients with IGT and a body-mass index (BMI) of at least 24 kg/m2 were randomly assigned to one of the following groups: placebo, metformin, or intensive lifestyle modification. After an average follow-up of 2.8 years, there was a 14% absolute risk reduction in the progression to diabetes in the lifestyle intervention group compared with placebo (number needed to treat [NNT]=7). Successful lifestyle interventions included weight loss of 5% to 7%, decreased fat intake, increased fiber intake, and 150 minutes of exercise per week."
"Does screening reduce lung cancer mortality
Current and former smokers are currently being screened for lung cancer with computed tomography (CT), although there are limited data on the effect screening has on lung cancer outcomes. Randomized controlled trials assessing CT screening are currently under way. To assess whether screening may increase the frequency of lung cancer diagnosis and lung cancer resection or may reduce the risk of a diagnosis of advanced lung cancer or death from lung cancer. Longitudinal analysis of 3246 asymptomatic current or former smokers screened for lung cancer beginning in 1998 either at 1 of 2 academic medical centers in the United States or an academic medical center in Italy with follow-up for a median of 3.9 years. Annual CT scans with comprehensive evaluation and treatment of detected nodules. Comparison of predicted with observed number of new lung cancer cases, lung cancer resections, advanced lung cancer cases, and deaths from lung cancer. There were 144 individuals diagnosed with lung cancer compared with 44.5 expected cases (relative risk [RR], 3.2; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.7-3.8; P<.001). There were 109 individuals who had a lung resection compared with 10.9 expected cases (RR, 10.0; 95% CI, 8.2-11.9; P<.001). There was no evidence of a decline in the number of diagnoses of advanced lung cancers (42 individuals compared with 33.4 expected cases) or deaths from lung cancer (38 deaths due to lung cancer observed and 38.8 expected; RR, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.7-1.3; P = .90). Screening for lung cancer with low-dose CT may increase the rate of lung cancer diagnosis and treatment, but may not meaningfully reduce the risk of advanced lung cancer or death from lung cancer. Until more conclusive data are available, asymptomatic individuals should not be screened outside of clinical research studies that have a reasonable likelihood of further clarifying the potential benefits and risks.","A cohort study using annual CT scanning to screen 3246 patients for lung cancer came to a different conclusion. The authors compared the observed number of lung cancer cases, resections, advanced lung cancer diagnoses, and deaths in screened patients with the expected rates based on validated prediction models. Lung cancer was diagnosed in 144 patients compared with 44 expected cases (RR=3.2; 95% CI, 2.7-3.8). Subsequently, 109 patients underwent lung resection compared with 11 expected (RR=10.0; 95% CI, 8.2-11.9). However, there was no decline in advanced cancers (42 actual vs 33 expected; P=.14) and no difference in deaths due to lung cancer (38 actual vs 38.8 expected; P=.9). The 81 patients diagnosed in this study with stage I disease who underwent surgical resection had 4-year estimated survival rates of 94% (95% CI, 85%-97%), matching the prior low-dose CT study."
"Does screening reduce lung cancer mortality
While population based screening for lung cancer has not been adopted by most countries, it is not clear whether sputum examinations, chest radiography or newer methods such as computed tomography are effective in reducing mortality from lung cancer. To determine whether screening for lung cancer using regular sputum examinations or chest radiography or CT chest reduces lung cancer mortality. Electronic databases (the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, PREMEDLINE and EMBASE; 1966 to July 2000) ), bibliographies, hand searching of a journal and discussion with experts were used to identify published and unpublished trials. Controlled trials of screening for lung cancer using sputum examinations, chest radiography or CT chest. Intention to screen analysis was performed. Where there was significant statistical heterogeneity relative risks were reported using the random effects model, but for other outcomes the fixed effect model was used. Seven trials were included (6 randomised controlled studies and 1 non-randomised controlled trial) with a total of 245,610 subjects. There were no studies with an unscreened control group. Frequent screening with chest x-rays was associated with an 11% relative increase in mortality from lung cancer compared with less frequent screening (RR 1.11, CI: 1.00-1.23). A non statistically significant trend was observed to reduced mortality from lung cancer when screening with chest x-ray and sputum cytology was compared with chest x-ray alone (RR 0.88, CI:0.74-1.03). Several of the included studies had potential methodological weaknesses. There were no controlled studies of spiral CT. The current evidence does not support screening for lung cancer with chest radiography or sputum cytology. Frequent chest x-ray screening might be harmful. Further, methodologically rigorous trials are required.","A Cochrane review identified 6 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 1 non-RCT (with a total of 245,610 patients) that screened patients with serial chest x-rays, with or without sputum cytology. Most patients were current or ex-smokers or had significant exposure to industrial smoke. No studies included an unscreened control group, and only 1 included women. Positive tests occurred in 13% of baseline screens and 5% of annual screens. Biopsies were performed according to a study protocol based on a nodule's size and behavior over time. Out of a total of 5646 positive screens, there were 535 biopsies, and a diagnosis of cancer in 492 patients. Of those with cancer, 412 (84%) had clinical stage I lung cancer; the authors estimated their 10-year survival rate was 88% (95% CI, 84%-91%). If patients with stage I disease underwent surgical resection within 1 month of diagnosis, their estimated 10-year survival increased to 92% (95% CI, 88%-95%)."
"What are the most effective nonpharmacologic therapies for irritable bowel syndrome
The aim of this study was to compare the response of symptoms and cytokine ratios in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) with ingestion of probiotic preparations containing a lactobacillus or bifidobacterium strain. Seventy-seven subjects with IBS were randomized to receive either Lactobacillus salivarius UCC4331 or Bifidobacterium infantis 35624, each in a dose of 1 x 10 10 live bacterial cells in a malted milk drink, or the malted milk drink alone as placebo for 8 weeks. The cardinal symptoms of IBS were recorded on a daily basis and assessed each week. Quality of life assessment, stool microbiologic studies, and blood sampling for estimation of peripheral blood mononuclear cell release of the cytokines interleukin (IL)-10 and IL-12 were performed at the beginning and at the end of the treatment phase. For all symptoms, with the exception of bowel movement frequency and consistency, those randomized to B infantis 35624 experienced a greater reduction in symptom scores; composite and individual scores for abdominal pain/discomfort, bloating/distention, and bowel movement difficulty were significantly lower than for placebo for those randomized to B infantis 35624 for most weeks of the treatment phase. At baseline, patients with IBS demonstrated an abnormal IL-10/IL-12 ratio, indicative of a proinflammatory, Th-1 state. This ratio was normalized by B infantis 35624 feeding alone. B infantis 35624 alleviates symptoms in IBS; this symptomatic response was associated with normalization of the ratio of an anti-inflammatory to a proinflammatory cytokine, suggesting an immune-modulating role for this organism, in this disorder.","One RCT compared the probiotic formula Bifidobacterium infantis 35624 with Lactobacillus and placebo, and found that IBS symptom scores and quality of life measures were better with the Bifidobacterium preparation (P<.05)."
"What is the best duration of steroid therapy for contact dermatitis rhus
Allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) may account for at least 20% of all childhood dermatitis. Clinically, its morphology is identical to other forms of dermatitis in acute, subacute and chronic forms. A persistent or unusual and localized pattern is often the key to diagnosis. Treatment has centered around the use of corticosteroids, with the adjunct of antihistamines, wet dressings, and emollients for alleviation of symptoms. The newer topical immunosuppressives, tacrolimus and pimecrolimus, may also hold promise as alternative therapies, although they have not been well-studied in this regard. Allergen identification, sometimes through patch testing and allergen avoidance are the keys to preventing recurrences of this disease.",A review recommends using prednisone for children with allergic contact dermatitis involving more than 10% of the total body surface area.
"How safe is vaginal birth after cesarean section for the mother and fetus
To evaluate the incidence and consequences of uterine rupture in women who have had a delivery by caesarean section. Systematic review. Medline, HealthSTAR, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, National Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, reference lists, and national experts. Studies in all languages were eligible if published in full. Methodological quality was evaluated for each study by using criteria from the United States Preventive Services Task Force and the National Health Service Centre for Reviews and Dissemination. Uterine rupture was categorised as asymptomatic or symptomatic. We reviewed 568 full text articles to identify 71 potentially eligible studies, 21 of which were rated at least fair in quality. Compared with elective repeat caesarean delivery, trial of labour increased the risk of uterine rupture by 2.7 (95% confidence interval 0.73 to 4.73) per 1000 cases. No maternal deaths were related to rupture. For women attempting vaginal delivery, the additional risk of perinatal death from rupture of a uterine scar was 1.4 (0 to 9.8) per 10,000 and the additional risk of hysterectomy was 3.4 (0 to 12.6) per 10 000. The rates of asymptomatic uterine rupture in trial of labour and elective repeat caesarean did not differ significantly. Although the literature on uterine rupture is imprecise and inconsistent, existing studies indicate that 370 (213 to 1370) elective caesarean deliveries would need to be performed to prevent one symptomatic uterine rupture.","In an attempt to quantify the risks of VBAC, a systematic review determined that attempted VBAC, compared with repeat low-transverse cesarean section, increased the risk of uterine rupture by 2.7 per 1000 cases 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.73-4.73."
"What effect do inhaled steroids have on delaying the progression of COPD
There is no consensus on the effectiveness of inhaled corticosteroids for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). To evaluate the long-term effects of inhaled corticosteroids on the rate of FEV1 decline in patients with COPD. MEDLINE, EMBASE, CISCOM, and AMED databases and the Cochrane Library (1966 to December 2002), reference lists from identified articles, and consultation with experts. Searches were not limited to the English language. Randomized, placebo-controlled trials that examined the rate of FEV1 decline as a primary outcome in patients with COPD. Two reviewers independently extracted the data by using predetermined criteria. For the six studies that met the inclusion criteria, the summary estimate for the difference in FEV1 decline between the placebo and treatment groups was -5.0 +/- 3.2 mL/y (95% CI, -11.2 to 1.2 mL/y; P = 0.11). The use of inhaled corticosteroids was not associated with the rate of FEV1 decline in 3571 patients followed for 24 to 54 months.","A meta-analysis of 6 randomized, placebo-controlled trials with a duration of at least 2 years (n=3571) found a nonsignificant trend in favor of ICS, with a difference in FEV1 decline of 5.31 mL/year (P=.08) between the ICS and placebo groups."
"How should we treat chronic daily headache when conservative measures fail
Although antidepressants are often used for preventing chronic headache, their effectiveness is uncertain. We performed a meta-analysis of English-language, randomized placebo-controlled trials of antidepressants as prophylaxis for chronic headache. Thirty-eight trials were included. Because some compared more than one drug with placebo, 44 study arms were combined using a random effects model. Twenty-five studies focused on migraines, 12 on tension headaches, and 1 on both. Nineteen used tricyclic antidepressants, 18 serotonin antagonists, and 7 selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Patients receiving antidepressants were twice as likely to report headache improvement (rate ratio [RR]: 2.0; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.6 to 2.4). Because 31% (95% CI: 23% to 40%) more treated patients improved than those receiving placebo, clinicians would need to treat 3.2 patients for 1 patient to improve. The average amount of improvement (standardized mean difference) was 0.94 (95% CI: 0.65 to 1.2), an effect considered large. Treated patients also consumed less analgesic medication (standardized mean difference, -0.7; 95% CI: -0.5 to -0.94). There were no differences in outcomes among the three classes of agents studied or by the type of headache (migraine vs. tension), quality score, length of treatment, or percentage of patients lost to follow-up. Assessment of depression across studies was insufficient to determine if the effects were independent of depression. Antidepressants are effective in preventing chronic headaches. Whether this is independent of depression and whether there are differences in efficacy by class of agent needs further study.","A meta-analysis from 2001 reviewed 38 RCTs of antidepressants as prophylaxis for chronic headache. Nineteen studies investigated TCAs, 18 examined serotonin blockers, and 7 focused on SSRIs. Patients taking antidepressants were twice as likely to report headache improvement rate ratio [RR]=2.0; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.6-2.4, with the average amount of improvement considered to be large standard mean difference=0.94; 95% CI, 0.65-1.2. Serotonin blockers, most of which are not available or commonly used in the US, and TCAs were all effective in decreasing the headache burden, while the results for SSRIs were less clear. Dosages of amitriptyline ranged from 10 to 150 mg daily; most of the studies used 60 to 100 mg daily."
"Do statins delay onset or slow progression of Alzheimer's dementia
: Two recent clinical reports describe an association between statin therapy and a reduction in the occurrence of Alzheimer's disease by as much as 70 %. One report is a cross-sectional analysis of discharges among three hospitals, and the other is a nested case control study drawn from ambulatory patients of general practitioners in the UK. Because neither study is a randomized trial, the association noted between statin therapy and a reduced incidence of Alzheimer's disease may have occurred because other factors, unaccounted for in the studies, may be present (so called bias) and be responsible for the observed association. However, there is an expanding body of biological and epidemiological data that makes it plausible that statin therapy may retard or prevent the pathogenesis and clinical expression of Alzheimer's disease. This review was initiated in order to find other clinical evidence that might support or refute the hypothesized benefit of statin therapy. : The purpose is to review the evidence that treatment with statins reduces the risk of Alzheimer's disease. : The following data bases were searched: Specialised Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group, MEDLINE (1966-2000/12), EMBASE (1980-2000/12), and Psych Info (1987-2000/11). Search terms included statins,lovastatin, pravastatin, simvastatin, alzheimer*, dement*, cogn*. : In order to be selected, trials needed to be randomized, doubled blinded, and of sufficient duration( probably years rather than weeks or months) to ascertain the preventive potential of statin therapy. : Data were to be extracted independently by two reviewers and pooled where appropriate and possible. The pooled odds ratios (95% CI) or the average differences were to be estimated. : There were no randomized trials found in the search. : There is no good evidence to recommend statins for reducing the risk of Alzheimer's disease. There is, however, a growing body of biological, epidemiological, and limited but non-randomized clinical evidence that lowering serum cholesterol may retard the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Mounting the clinical studies to determine the potential benefit of statin therapy should be a high priority for future research agendas.","A systematic review concluded that no good evidence recommended statins for reducing the risk of Alzheimer's dementia. Notably, the review did find a body of inconclusive evidence that lowering serum cholesterol may retard disease pathogenesis."
"Do imaging studies aid diagnosis of acute sinusitis
The objective of this study was to assess the discriminative properties of the methods for diagnosing acute maxillary sinusitis (AMS) in unselected patients. The study design was a systematic review of evaluation studies identified by using Medline, by searching reference lists, by hand searches, and by contacting investigators. Evaluation studies were conducted anywhere in the world. Subjects were adults with suspected AMS. Main outcome measures were: sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative likelihood ratios of the primary studies, weighted means of these parameters in each comparison (clinical examination, radiography, and ultrasound compared to a reference standard in diagnosing AMS), and summary ROC curves and their Q* points where sensitivity equals specificity. For the years from 1962 to present, 49 study reports were found; 11 articles on studies that included a total of 1144 patients were eligible. Compared to sinus puncture, radiography was the most accurate method for diagnosing AMS: the Q* point on the summary ROC curve was 0.82 (95% confidence interval, CI, 0.78-0.85). Ultrasound was slightly less accurate than radiography compared to sinus puncture (Q* 0.80, 95% CI 0.76-0.83). Only two articles reported clinical examination compared to sinus puncture and the Q* for them was 0.75 (95% 0.58-0.86). Clinical examination is a rather unreliable method for diagnosing AMS, even in the hands of experienced specialists. Using radiography or ultrasound improves the accuracy of diagnosis. The diagnosis of AMS is rarely studied in primary care settings. Future comparative trials should preferably combine diagnosis and treatment, evaluating the two aspects of clinical management as unit.","aging methodologies are better reserved for patients in whom surgery is being contemplated, or for whom chronic sinusitis is a concern."
"Should home apnea monitoring be recommended to prevent SIDS
Home monitors designed to identify cardiorespiratory events are frequently used in infants at increased risk for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), but the efficacy of such devices for this use is unproven. To test the hypothesis that preterm infants, siblings of infants who died of SIDS, and infants who have experienced an idiopathic, apparent life-threatening event have a greater risk of cardiorespiratory events than healthy term infants. Longitudinal cohort study conducted from May 1994 through February 1998. Five metropolitan medical centers in the United States. A total of 1079 infants (classified as healthy term infants and 6 groups of those at risk for SIDS) who, during the first 6 months after birth, were observed with home cardiorespiratory monitors using respiratory inductance plethysmography to detect apnea and obstructed breathing. Occurrence of cardiorespiratory events that exceeded predefined conventional and extreme thresholds as recorded by the monitors. During 718 358 hours of home monitoring, 6993 events exceeding conventional alarm thresholds occurred in 445 infants (41%). Of these, 653 were extreme events in 116 infants (10%), and of those events with apnea, 70% included at least 3 obstructed breaths. The frequency of at least 1 extreme event was similar in term infants in all groups, but preterm infants were at increased risk of extreme events until 43 weeks' postconceptional age. In this study, conventional events are quite common, even in healthy term infants. Extreme events were common only in preterm infants, and their timing suggests that they are not likely to be immediate precursors to SIDS. The high frequency of obstructed breathing in study participants would likely preclude detection of many events by conventional techniques. These data should be important for designing future monitors and determining if an infant is likely to be at risk for a cardiorespiratory event.","A prospective cohort study of 1079 infants monitored for cardiorespiratory events, the Collaborative Home Infant Monitor Evaluation (CHIME) study, demonstrated that prior to 43 weeks postconceptional age, preterm infants had a statistically significant greater risk of extreme events (apnea or bradycardia longer than 30 seconds) compared with healthy term infants (Table 2). After 43 weeks postconceptional age, there were no differences in incidence of apnea or bradycardia, comparing preterm and term infants. Neither preterm infants nor infants with apnea, bradycardia, or apparent life-threatening events had increased incidences of SIDS."
"Should home apnea monitoring be recommended to prevent SIDS
More than 25 years have elapsed since continuous cardiorespiratory monitoring at home was suggested to decrease the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). In the ensuing interval, multiple studies have been unable to establish the alleged efficacy of its use. In this statement, the most recent research information concerning extreme limits for a prolonged course of apnea of prematurity is reviewed. Recommendations regarding the appropriate use of home cardiorespiratory monitoring after hospital discharge emphasize limiting use to specific clinical indications for a predetermined period, using only monitors equipped with an event recorder, and counseling parents that monitor use does not prevent sudden, unexpected death in all circumstances. The continued implementation of proven SIDS prevention measures is encouraged.","Significant financial costs are associated with home monitoring. The average monthly cost is $300 to $400, not including physician fees. This would lead to an estimated annual cost of $24 million dollars if every infant <1500 grams in the United States were monitored."
"Should home apnea monitoring be recommended to prevent SIDS
The immediate post-partum period is stressful for most parents. The need to use a home apnea monitor may tax parental coping skills even further. Therefore, we conducted a study to assess the psychosocial consequences of apnea monitoring on parental emotional distress and family functioning. We studied 104 parents of infants at high risk for cardiopulmonary arrest. Fifty-two parents had infants who used home apnea monitors, and 52 parents were age-matched and gender-matched control subjects. Data were collected during the infant's hospitalization, and then at 2 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months after discharge. At 1 year, parents were interviewed about their attitudes toward using the apnea monitor. Both groups experienced elevated levels of emotional distress, but the group with infants who used the monitors had significant increases in depression and hostility immediately following discharge from the hospital compared with baseline, whereas the non-monitored group had a significant increase in hostility at 6 months. At 1-year follow-up, the majority of the parents reported that they used the monitor every night, felt more secure in using it, and judged it helpful. The immediate period following hospital discharge of infants who need to use a home apnea monitor is characterized by significant emotional distress for the parents, which resolves over time. Anticipatory education and counseling of parents is recommended.","The psychological costs of home apnea monitoring have been studied. One hundred and four parents of monitored and unmonitored infants were enrolled in a questionnaire study to determine emotional distress and family functioning. As is common among families in the postpartum period, all experienced increased stress. But parents of monitored infants, compared with parents of unmonitored infants, had an increased incidence of subjective depression (number needed to harm [NNH]=7) and hostility (NNH=12) at 2 weeks postpartum. Interestingly, at 1-year follow-up interviews, 83% of parents who had consistently used the monitor reported feeling more secure for having used it and 69% believed that monitor use had been helpful."
"Does stopping a statin increase the short-term risk of a cardiovascular event
There is increasing interest in the non-lipid-lowering effects of statins and their effect on outcomes in patients with acute coronary syndrome. It has been suggested that withdrawal of statin therapy during an acute coronary syndrome may attenuate any benefits of pretreatment, thereby providing indirect evidence of the importance of their non-lipid-lowering effects. This observational study compared the demographic and clinical characteristics and hospital outcomes in patients with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction enrolled in the National Registry of Myocardial Infarction 4. Comparison groups consisted of patients previously receiving statins who also received statins within 24 hours of hospital admission (n = 9,001), patients previously using statins in whom therapy was discontinued (n = 4,870), and patients who did not receive statins at any time before or during hospitalization (n = 54,635). Of 13,871 patients receiving statins before hospital admission, 35.1% had treatment withdrawn during the first 24 hours of hospitalization. These patients had increased hospital morbidity and mortality rates relative to patients in whom therapy was continued, with higher rates of heart failure, ventricular arrhythmias, shock, and death. In multivariate analyses, these patients were at statistically significant increased risk of hospital death compared with those continuing statin therapy and at similar risk compared with those not receiving statins before or during hospitalization. Withdrawal of statin therapy in the first 24 hours of hospitalization for non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction is associated with worse hospital outcomes. In the absence of data from randomized clinical trials, our findings suggest that statin therapy should be continued during hospitalization for myocardial infarction unless strongly contraindicated.","One retrospective case-control study evaluated 4870 patients who had statin therapy withdrawn on admission to the hospital for non-ST segment elevation MI (NSTEMI). Patients who had their statins withheld had increased rates of heart failure, arrhythmia, shock, and death (hazard ratio=2.32; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.02-2.67)."
"Does stopping a statin increase the short-term risk of a cardiovascular event
HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitors (statins) reduce cardiac event rates in patients with stable coronary heart disease. Withdrawal of chronic statin treatment during acute coronary syndromes may impair vascular function independent of lipid-lowering effects and thus increase cardiac event rate. We investigated the effects of statins on the cardiac event rate in 1616 patients of the Platelet Receptor Inhibition in Ischemic Syndrome Management (PRISM) study who had coronary artery disease and chest pain in the previous 24 hours. We recorded death and nonfatal myocardial infarction during the 30-day follow-up. Baseline clinical characteristics did not differ among 1249 patients without statin therapy, 379 patients with continued statin therapy, and 86 patients with discontinued statin therapy after hospitalization. Statin therapy was associated with a reduced event rate at 30-day follow-up compared with patients without statins (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.49 [95% CI, 0.21 to 0.86]; P=0.004). If the statin therapy was withdrawn after admission, cardiac risk increased compared with patients who continued to receive statins (2.93 [95% CI, 1.64 to 6.27]; P=0.005) and tended to be higher compared with patients who never received statins (1.69 [95% CI, 0.92 to 3.56]; P=0.15). This was related to an increased event rate during the first week after onset of symptoms and was independent of cholesterol levels. In a multivariate model, troponin T elevation (P=0.005), ST changes (P=0.02), and continuation of statin therapy (P=0.008) were the only independent predictors of patient outcome. Statin pretreatment in patients with acute coronary syndromes is associated with improved clinical outcome. However, discontinuation of statins after onset of symptoms completely abrogates this beneficial effect.","A post-hoc analysis of data from the PRISM trial found that among the 86 patients who were admitted for chest pain and had their statin withdrawn, a higher rate of death and nonfatal MI was observed, compared with the 379 patients whose statins were continued (hazard ratio=2.93; 95% CI, 1.64-6.27). This effect was seen in the first week and was independent of cholesterol levels and measures of severity of illness."
"Does physical therapy improve symptoms of fibromyalgia
To determine the effectiveness of a muscle strengthening program compared to a stretching program in women with fibromyalgia (FM). Sixty-eight women with FM were randomly assigned to a 12 week, twice weekly exercise program consisting of either muscle strengthening or stretching. Outcome measures included muscle strength (main outcome variable), flexibility, weight, body fat, tender point count, and disease and symptom severity scales. No statistically significant differences between groups were found on independent t tests. Paired t tests revealed twice the number of significant improvements in the strengthening group compared to the stretching group. Effect size scores indicated that the magnitude of change was generally greater in the strengthening group than the stretching group. Patients with FM can engage in a specially tailored muscle strengthening program and experience an improvement in overall disease activity, without a significant exercise induced flare in pain. Flexibility training alone also results in overall improvements, albeit of a lesser degree.","In a trial of muscle strengthening vs flexibility training, investigators found no difference between groups on measures including tender points and disease and symptom severity. They did find benefits in symptoms and self-efficacy over baseline, but it is not known whether these were sustained."
"Does physical therapy improve symptoms of fibromyalgia
To evaluate the efficacy of a 6-week exercise and educational program for patients with fibromyalgia. Forty-one subjects were randomly assigned to the program or served as waiting list controls. Program outcome was assessed with a 6-minute walk test, the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire, a Self-Efficacy Scale, and a ""knowledge"" questionnaire (based on information provided during the educational sessions). Waiting list control subjects subsequently completed the program. Program outcome was reassessed 3 or 6 months post-program. The program produced significant improvements in 6-minute walk distance, well-being, fatigue, self-efficacy (for controlling pain and other symptoms), and knowledge. At followup, immediate gains in walk distance, well-being, and self-efficacy were maintained, but gains in fatigue and knowledge were lost. Short-term exercise and educational programs can produce immediate and sustained benefits for patients with fibromyalgia. The benefits of our program may be due to exercise or education since both interventions were given.","In a study, 45 patients with fibromyalgia were randomly assigned to a 6-week program combining exercise and multidisciplinary education or to a control group. The treatment group had significant improvements in walking distance and for 2 measures on the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (feeling bad and morning fatigue)."
"Does physical therapy improve symptoms of fibromyalgia
To compare the effectiveness of biofeedback/relaxation, exercise, and a combined program for the treatment of fibromyalgia. Subjects (n = 119) were randomly assigned to one of 4 groups: 1) biofeedback/relaxation training, 2) exercise training, 3) a combination treatment, or 4) an educational/attention control program. All 3 treatment groups produced improvements in self-efficacy for function relative to the control condition. In addition, all treatment groups were significantly different from the control group on tender point index scores, reflecting a modest deterioration by the attention control group rather than improvements by the treatment groups. The exercise and combination groups also resulted in modest improvements on a physical activity measure. The combination group best maintained benefits across the 2-year period. This study demonstrates that these 3 treatment interventions result in improved self-efficacy for physical function which was best maintained by the combination group.","In the highest-quality trial, Buckelew and colleagues randomized 119 subjects to 1 of 4 groups: biofeedback and relaxation training, exercise training, combination treatment, and an education and attention control program. Individuals were evaluated on measures of pain, function, disease impact, and self-efficacy. Evaluators were blinded to treatment group. Patients were followed for 2 years, and follow-up information was available on 85% of patients. At immediate postintervention follow-up, all treatment groups were significantly improved on tender-point index score compared with the control group, but this was due to a modest deterioration for the control group rather than improvements in the treatment groups. In addition, all groups showed improvements in self-efficacy for function compared with the control group but not for other self-efficacy measures. While within-group improvements in the treatment groups were seen, no significant differences were seen from the control group."
"What are the repercussions of disclosing a medical error
Mandatory disclosure of medical errors has been advocated to improve patient safety. Many resist mandatory disclosure policies because of concerns about increasing malpractice exposure. It has been countered that malpractice liability actually decreases when there is full disclosure of medical errors. A comprehensive literature search was conducted to determine what is known about the impact of full disclosure on malpractice liability. Electronic searches of multiple databases were supplemented with hand searches of bibliographies and communication with recognized experts in the field. Screening the titles, abstracts, and, in many cases, the full articles from more than an estimated 5,200 citations resulted in identification of one published study directly examining malpractice liability when a policy of full disclosure was implemented. Despite extensive literature on the impact of disclosure on malpractice liability, few well-designed studies have focused on the real-world impact on the volume and cost of suits following implementation of a full disclosure policy. Many articles examine why patients sue their doctors, suggesting that some lawsuits may be averted by disclosure, but the articles do not allow us to estimate the additional suits that would be created by disclosure. Additional studies addressing the effect of disclosure on malpractice liability are needed.","Even though physicians feel that disclosure of errors is important, they may lack the skills to make a successful disclosure or feel they do not have institutional support for disclosure."
"What is the best way to evaluate an acute traumatic knee injury
Previous studies have shown that the application of the Ottawa knee rule (OKR) reduces the need for radiographs in adults with acute knee injuries. Our objectives were to describe the epidemiology and incidence of knee injuries in children with acute knee trauma and to validate the OKR in a pediatric population. A prospective, consecutive study. Two urban pediatric emergency departments. All children 18 years of age and under who presented with acute traumatic knee injury of less than 1 week's duration, excluding patients with a normal knee examination, superficial skin injuries, prior history of knee injury, underlying bone disease, serious injuries involving two or more organ systems, or altered mental status were enrolled. Physicians assessed each patient for 22 standardized clinical findings prior to radiography. The OKR was applied to each patient by the investigating physician. All 234 patients eligible for the study had radiographs of the affected knee. The median age was 13 years with a range of 2 to 18 years. Using the OKR criteria for obtaining knee radiographs, 12 of 13 patients with fractures were identified (sensitivity 92%; 95% CI= 64-99). The missed case was an 8-year-old male who had sustained a nondisplaced fracture of the proximal tibia after a fall. If the OKR were applied to the pediatric population, it would have reduced the need for radiography in 46% of children. In the pediatric population studied, the OKR did not identify all patients with knee fractures. Future studies may consider modifying the OKR to accommodate the differences between pediatric and adult patients to improve the sensitivity of the rule while maintaining its specificity, before it can be applied routinely in clinical practice.","A prospective study of the Ottawa rules among children with acute knee injury demonstrated a positive likelihood ratio (LR+) of 1.81 (95% CI, 1.47-2.21) and an LR- of 0.16 (95% CI, 0.02-1.04). However, limited information is available in the pediatric population."
"What is the best way to evaluate an acute traumatic knee injury
A report in the orthopedics literature states that MR imaging for internal derangement of the knee has a lower accuracy in adolescents than in adults and may even provide spurious information that alters clinical management. This assertion has not been specifically addressed in the radiology literature. The purpose of our study was to determine the accuracy of MR imaging in adolescents with regard to injury of the cruciate ligaments and menisci. A database search of our institution's records from January 1998 to July 2000 yielded 2140 MR examinations of the knee, all of which had been performed with a standard knee protocol on a 1.5-T magnet. Of these 2140 examinations, 156 included patients younger than 18 years. Fifty-nine of these patients underwent surgery, and the orthopedic surgeons' operative reports were used as the gold standard with which the MR imaging results were compared. Thirty-four boys and 25 girls who ranged in age from 11 to 17 years (mean age, 15 years) were examined. The clinical notes for the remaining 97 patients were evaluated for information about management and clinical improvement. The sensitivity and specificity values for MR imaging of the menisci and cruciate ligaments in adolescents were as follows: medial meniscus, 92% sensitivity and 87% specificity; lateral meniscus, 93% sensitivity and 95% specificity; anterior cruciate ligament, 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity; and posterior cruciate ligament, 0% sensitivity and 100% specificity. Our data suggest that MR imaging of the knee in adolescents is sensitive, specific, and accurate.","In a retrospective study of adolescents (11 to 17 years of age) having knee MRIs and undergoing knee surgery, MRI compared favorably with the operative (gold standard) diagnosis."
"Does warfarin prevent deep venous thrombosis in high-risk patients
Patients undergoing rehabilitation after thromboembolic stroke have a relatively high incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Warfarin, with a target international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.0-3.0 is effective for the prevention of VTE. However, because stroke is a major risk factor for bleeding with warfarin, a less intense regimen (target INR < 2.0), might safely prevent VTE in stroke rehabilitation patients. This study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 2 mg of warfarin in patients undergoing rehabilitation following completed stroke. The major efficacy endpoint was symptomatic, objectively proven VTE or asymptomatic VTE detected by monthly duplex ultrasonography (DU) of the proximal leg veins or mandatory bilateral contrast venography performed at the end of the study. The major safety endpoint was bleeding. There were 475 patients screened for enrollment, 355 had one or more exclusion criterion, and 17 had previously undetected proximal DVT on admission. Of the 103 eligible and consenting patients, 56 received warfarin and 47 received placebo. Of the randomized patients, 88 had successful venography (47 warfarin and 41 placebo). In the warfarin group, three (8%) patients had DVT and one (2%) had proximal DVT whereas in the placebo group, seven (20%) had DVT and five (13%) had proximal DVT. The risk ratio for any DVT in warfarin-treated patients relative to placebo-treated patients was 0.39 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.13-1.37). For proximal DVT, the risk ratio was 0.17 (95% CI, 0.01-1.4). No patients suffered major bleeding. A fixed dose of 2 mg of warfarin per day in patients undergoing stroke rehabilitation is safe and associated with a relative risk reduction of about 80% in the incidence of proximal DVT and 60% in overall DVT.","A few small studies suggest that warfarin reduces DVT rates in spinal-cord-injured patients. A small trial randomized stroke patients undergoing rehabilitation to placebo or fixed 1- or 2-mg doses of warfarin. This underpowered study showed a nonsignificant decrease in the risk of development of DVT RR=0.39; 95% CI, 0.13-1.37."
"What is the most effective treatment for tinea pedis athlete's foot
In this randomized double-blind trial, two new antifungal compounds were compared in patients with interdigital or more extensive forms of tinea pedis. Two weeks of oral treatment with either terbinafine, an allylamine and new chemical entity, 250 mg daily, or itraconazole 100 mg daily, was given to 366 patients (184 terbinafine, 182 itraconazole). Of 13 patients who did not return after the first visit, 11 were lost to follow-up (five on terbinafine, six on itraconazole) and two reported adverse events. Another nine patients (three on terbinafine and six on itraconazole) were excluded because it was uncertain to which group they were randomized. A central laboratory performed both the mycology and safety tests. In 355 patients who received the study medications and were available for analysis of side-effects, 18 out of 179 (10.0%) in the terbinafine group and 10 out of 176 (5.7%) in the itraconazole group reported adverse events. No new clinically significant laboratory abnormalities were seen after treatment. At week 8 the efficacy analysis in 117 patients with mycologically confirmed dermatophyte infections (51 on terbinafine, 66 on itraconazole) showed that clinical symptoms were absent or minimal in 94.1% of the terbinafine and 72.7% of the itraconazole group (P = 0.0095); mycology was negative in 86.3% of the terbinafine and 54.5% of the itraconazole group (P = 0.0002). With terbinafine, negative mycology at week 8 was 81.3% in the interdigital and 88.6% in the more extensive forms of tinea pedis; with itraconazole mycology was negative in 65.0% and 50.0% of patients, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","In a large double-blind multicenter study of all forms of tinea pedis, De Keyser et al compared 2 weeks of terbinafine at 250 mg/day to 2 weeks of itraconazole at 100 mg/day. After 8 weeks they found terbinafine superior to itraconazole for clinical cure (94.1% vs 72.4%). In a single multicenter open study the cure rate for fluconazole 150 mg was 77% when used once weekly for 3 weeks."
"Which medications can be split without compromising efficacy and safety
The primary objective was to determine the effect of a hydroxymethylglutaryl- CoA reductase inhibitor (HMG) tablet-splitting program on laboratory outcomes (lipid panel and liver enzyme tests). Other objectives were to assess patient compliance and satisfaction with splitting tablets and to measure the reduction in drug acquisition costs. Patients at a Veterans Affairs Health Care System facility were included in this study if they participated in the HMG tablet-splitting program between April and September 2000. Patients taking the same drug and dosage before and after implementation of the program were asked to complete a mailed questionnaire designed to measure satisfaction and compliance with the program. Data collected through electronic charts included patient demographics, prescribed medication, and the values for lipid panel and liver function tests. A total of 2,019 patients were included in the study. The total cost avoidance achieved over one year for atorvastatin, lovastatin, and simvastatin was 138,108 dollars (N=2,019). The majority of patients who responded to the questionnaire were satisfied and compliant with tablet splitting. In the laboratory analysis (N=512), there was no difference between prevalues and postvalues for total cholesterol and triglycerides. There was a statistically, but not clinically, significant decrease in LDL (102 versus 97, P<0.001) and increase in HDL (46 versus 48, P<0.001), AST (26 versus 28, P<0.001), and ALT (24 versus 26, P=0.006) after the initiation of tablet splitting. Tablet splitting of HMGs had no short-term negative effects on laboratory outcomes and favorable effects on humanistic outcomes as measured by patient satisfaction and compliance. Tablet splitting of HMGs is an effective way to reduce costs and nearly double the number of patients who can be treated for the same expense.","A retrospective study evaluated tablet-splitting by 512 patients taking statins atorvastatin, lovastatin, simvastatin. Cholesterol values after 12 or more weeks on a stable whole-tablet dose were compared with those 6 to 52 weeks after initiating tablet-splitting; no significant change was seen in total cholesterol or triglycerides. There was a statistically significant decrease in LDL (102±28 vs 97±29 mg/dL, P<.001), an increase in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (46±12 vs 48±12 mg/dL, P<.001), and an increase in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (26±8 vs 28±10 units/L, P<.001), which was attributed to higher medication dosage from accidental ingestion of whole tablets and to diet and lifestyle modifications."
"Is MRI useful for evaluation of acute low back pain
The relation between abnormalities in the lumbar spine and low back pain is controversial. We examined the prevalence of abnormal findings on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the lumbar spine in people without back pain. We performed MRI examinations on 98 asymptomatic people. The scans were read independently by two neuroradiologists who did not know the clinical status of the subjects. To reduce the possibility of bias in interpreting the studies, abnormal MRI scans from 27 people with back pain were mixed randomly with the scans from the asymptomatic people. We used the following standardized terms to classify the five intervertebral disks in the lumbosacral spine: normal, bulge (circumferential symmetric extension of the disk beyond the interspace), protrusion (focal or asymmetric extension of the disk beyond the interspace), and extrusion (more extreme extension of the disk beyond the interspace). Nonintervertebral disk abnormalities, such as facet arthropathy, were also documented. Thirty-six percent of the 98 asymptomatic subjects had normal disks at all levels. With the results of the two readings averaged, 52 percent of the subjects had a bulge at at least one level, 27 percent had a protrusion, and 1 percent had an extrusion. Thirty-eight percent had an abnormality of more than one intervertebral disk. The prevalence of bulges, but not of protrusions, increased with age. The most common nonintervertebral disk abnormalities were Schmorl's nodes (herniation of the disk into the vertebral-body end plate), found in 19 percent of the subjects; annular defects (disruption of the outer fibrous ring of the disk), in 14 percent; and facet arthropathy (degenerative disease of the posterior articular processes of the vertebrae), in 8 percent. The findings were similar in men and women. On MRI examination of the lumbar spine, many people without back pain have disk bulges or protrusions but not extrusions. Given the high prevalence of these findings and of back pain, the discovery by MRI of bulges or protrusions in people with low back pain may frequently be coincidental.","The lower specificity of MRI for radiculopathy means that MRI can detect disk herniations that do not cause the patient's signs or symptoms. In one study, MRI demonstrated herniated disks in 25% of asymptomatic persons."
"What is the best portable method of purifying water to prevent infectious disease
The ability to control water-borne diseases is critical for soldiers, hikers, and others who may need to drink directly from an outdoor source. Water-borne protozoan parasites that are specifically of concern are Giardia and Cryptosporidium because of their resistance to halogen disinfection. The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of iodine tablets against Giardia and Cryptosporidium under general- and worst-case water conditions that might be found in the field. Giardia cysts and Cryptosporidium oocysts were exposed to iodine according to manufacturer's instructions (two tablets/L = 13-18 mg/L for 20 minutes). This dose inactivated 3-log10 of Giardia in general-case water and pH 9. In worst-case water, however, only about 35% of cysts were inactivated at pH 5. Fifty minutes were required to achieve a 3-log10 reduction at pH 5. Cryptosporidium oocysts were more difficult to inactivate. Only 10% were inactivated after a 20-minute exposure to iodine according to manufacturer's instructions; even after 240 minutes of exposure to iodine only 66-81% oocysts were inactivated. These data strongly suggest that iodine disinfection is not effective in inactivating Cryptosporidium oocysts in water. Because this organism is common in all surface waters, it is recommended that another method of treatment be used before ingestion.","Halogenation does not reduce Cryptosporidium below the microbiological hazard of 99.9%, but it is generally accepted to effectively treat viruses, bacteria, and other protozoa after filtering through a cloth to remove large particles."
"What is the addiction risk associated with tramadol
To assess the drug dependence and abuse liability of tramadol. Subjects of opiate addicts with history of tramadol abuse were 219. Physical dependence of tramadol was assessed using opiate withdrawal scale (OWS), psychic dependence was assessed by association test of Addiction Research Center Inventory-Chinese Version (ARCI-CV); the degrees of craving experienced for tramadol was self-reported on visual analogue scale (VAS). The scores of OWS of tramadol were 0.05-1.07; 3 scores on scales in particular being used the identify euphoric effects--MBG, sedative effects--PCAG, and psychotomimetic effects--LSD of ARCI were 7.3, 6.1, and 3.4, respectively (F = 38.1, P < 0.01); 57.1% of tramadol abuse subjects had craving for tramadol (chi 2 = 75.86, P < 0.01). Tramadol produced high abuse potential among opiate addicts.","Another prospective study assessed the subjective tramadol withdrawal experience in 219 patients with a diagnosis of ""Tramadol misuse"" who were attending 6 drug detoxification centers in China. Validated drug dependence symptom scales found that while the degree of physical dependence reported was uniformly mild, the majority of patients reported the psychic dependence symptom of tramadol craving."
"How should a DEXA scan be used to evaluate bisphosphonate therapy for osteoporosis
The ability of dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) to monitor bone mineral density (BMD) has been well documented in epidemiologic and pharmaceutical trials. However, its application to monitoring of patients in clinical practice has been subject to recent controversies. Despite these controversies, most clinical centers rely on DXA for monitoring of patients, and therefore guidance is needed. In this article, we report the positions developed by an expert panel of the International Society for Clinical Densitometry on the use of densitometry for the serial measurement of bone mass for monitoring change in BMD. The panel found DXA to be a precise method of measuring change in BMD if used with an appropriate level of least significant change (LSC), at anatomic sites with good precision and response to therapy, and at 1- to 2-yr time intervals. Monitoring is acceptable for determining when therapy is indicated, and if an agent is not therapeutically effective (i.e., when bone loss occurs despite treatment). Each densitometry center should perform an in vivo precision study on individuals similar to the patient population at the center and determine LSC at a 95% confidence level. If such a precision study cannot be performed, benchmark precision might be used, although there was no agreement on what values should be used. The PA spine is the preferred anatomic site for monitoring. The total hip can be used when the spine study is technically invalid. We conclude with recommendations for further research.","In summary, limitations in DEXA precision mean any changes in BMD of less than 5.6% at the femoral neck may be due to measurement error, and BMD response to bisphosphonates vacillates in the first few years of use but can be expected to increase femoral neck BMD 3% to 6% over 3 years. Therefore, if serial DEXA scanning is preformed on patients prescribed bisphosphonate therapy, it should be considered no earlier than 2 to 3 years after therapy begins. When monitoring osteoporosis therapy, a BMD change within the LSC should be interpreted as ""no change"" and should not lead to changes in patient management. If the BMD has decreased beyond the LSC there is cause for concern and reevaluation of diagnosis and treatment are warranted."
"What environmental modifications improve pediatric asthma
To determine the effectiveness of a cotinine-feedback, behaviorally based education intervention in reducing environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) exposure and health-care utilization of children with asthma. Randomized controlled trial of educational intervention vs usual care. The pediatric pulmonary service of a regional pediatric hospital. ETS-exposed, Medicaid/Medi-Cal-eligible, predominantly minority children who were 3 to 12 years old and who were seen for asthma in the hospital's emergency, inpatient, and outpatient services departments (n = 87). Three nurse-led sessions employing behavior-changing strategies and basic asthma education and that incorporated repeated feedback on the child's urinary cotinine level. The primary measurements were the urinary cotinine/creatinine ratio (CCR) and the number of acute asthma medical visits. The secondary measurements were number of hospitalizations, smoking restrictions in home, amount smoked, reported exposures of children, and asthma control. The intervention was associated with a significantly lower odds ratio (OR) for more than one acute asthma medical visit in the follow-up year, after adjusting for baseline visits (total visits, 87; OR, 0.32; p = 0.03), and a comparably sized but nonsignificant OR for one or more hospitalization (OR, 0.34; p = 0.14). The follow-up CCR measurement and the determination of whether smoking was prohibited inside the home strongly favored the intervention group (n = 51) (mean difference in CCR adjusted for baseline, -0.38; p = 0.26; n = 51) (60; OR [for proportion of subjects prohibiting smoking], 0.24; p = 0.11; n = 60). This intervention significantly reduced asthma health-care utilization in ETS-exposed, low-income, minority children. Effects sizes for urine cotinine and proportion prohibiting smoking were moderate to large but not statistically significant, possibly the result of reduced precision due to the loss of patients to active follow-up. Improving ETS reduction interventions and understanding their mechanism of action on asthma outcomes requires further controlled trials that measure ETS exposure and behavioral and disease outcomes concurrently.","In a randomized trial of predominantly poor minority subjects, fewer acute asthma medical visits were needed by children whose household members underwent behavioral education aimed at decreasing smoke exposure."
"Do nasal decongestants relieve symptoms
The aims of the study were to determine: 1) how mucociliary activity in acute bacterial rhinosinusitis is affected; 2) how this activity is changed by therapy; 3) the effects of topical agents on mucociliary clearance, and 4) the most appropriate topical agent(s) to be used in the therapy of sinusitis. Five groups of patients with acute bacterial rhinosinusitis were studied prospectively. All patients had 500 mg oral amoxicillin and 125 mg oral clavulanic acid preparations given three times daily for 3 weeks. According to the topical agent applications, these groups included: group I (n = 12), no topical treatment was given; group II (n = 14), two puffs for each nostril once daily of 50 microg/100 mL fluticasone propionate was given; group III (n = 9), one puff for each nostril three times daily of 0.05% oxymetazoline was given; group IV (n =12), 3% sodium chloride (NaCl) (buffered to pH 6.5-7 at room temperature) was given; and group V (n =13), 10-mL solutions of 0.9% NaCl (buffered to pH 6.5--7 at room temperature) were given for nasal irrigations three times daily. All patients had medication for 3 weeks and were controlled each week. The saccharin method was used to measure nasal mucociliary clearance. To investigate the early effects of the topical agents for groups II to V, an additional test was repeated 20 minutes after the basal mucociliary clearance recordings. The test was repeated in the first, second, and third weeks of the treatment. The mucociliary clearance was significantly slower in the acute bacterial rhinosinusitis group than in the control group. There was no significant difference between the basal mucociliary clearance and the 20th minute mucociliary clearance of the fluticasone propionate and 0.9% NaCl solution groups. The mean values of the basal and the 20 minute's mucociliary clearance of the oxymetazoline group were 24.72 +/- 6.16 and 15.5 +/- 7.45 minutes, respectively, which were statistically significant. The mean values of the basal and the 20th minute mucociliary clearance of the 3% NaCl solution groups were 19.45 +/- 9.35 and 15.45 +/- 8.20 minutes, respectively, which were also statistically significant. In the first group (without topical treatment), the basal mucociliary clearance became significantly shorter after the second week of treatment. In the first and second weeks of the treatment of the oxymetazoline group, the mucociliary clearance did not change significantly, but after the third week the mucociliary clearance was significantly shorter. In the 3% NaCl solution group, significant improvement began from the first week and continued through the third week. Comparing the basal and the third weeks' mucociliary clearance values among the groups, the oxymetazoline and 3% NaCl solution groups revealed more significant improvement than the other groups, but this improvement was not different from the improvement of group I. There was still a statistically significant difference in the mucociliary clearance of the post-treatment sinusitis groups from the control group. The oxymetazoline and 3% NaCl solution groups seemed to be more effective in mucociliary clearance, but there was no significant difference in improvement among the groups. The improvement of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis takes more than 3 weeks, according to the mucociliary clearance values of the groups.","One placebo-controlled, randomized controlled trial evaluated the effect on mucociliary clearance from adding nasal saline, nasal steroids, or oxymetazoline to antibiotics in acute bacterial sinusitis. The group using oxymetazoline increased mucociliary clearance immediately (within 20 minutes). However, at 3 weeks, the improvement in mucociliary clearance in the oxymetazoline group was not significantly different than in the other groups."
"Do nasal decongestants relieve symptoms
The efficacy of a new administration form of oxymetazoline, a nasal bellows container, was investigated in two separate studies by means of a combined treatment with phenoxymethyl-penicillin for acute maxillary sinusitis. In the first study (study 1), oxymetazoline administered with a bellows (OXBE) was compared both with a placebo belows (PLBE) as well as with oxymetazoline and placebo administered with a conventional nasal spray (OXSP respective PLSP) in 73 patients. In the second study (study 2), OXBE was compared only with PLBE in 48 patients. Objective evaluation was made by comparing the radiographical improvement in conventional plain sinus X-ray images. A scoring system corresponding to the outcome of antral irrigation was used for evaluating the X-ray pictures. Subjective symptoms; nasal stuffiness and pain, were assessed by registrations on visual analogue scales. Neither with regard to radiographical improvement nor to decrease in subjective symptoms could any significant differences be found between the different treatment modes. Oxymetazoline administered with a nasal bellows thus did not accelerate the rate of healing of acute maxillary sinusitis in these two studies. It is inferred from these results that decongestion of the sinus ostia is not of primary importance for the course of healing of a manifest acute sinusitis.","A prospective, placebo-controlled study evaluated improvement in x-ray findings as well as subjective symptoms in acute sinusitis using phenoxymethyl-penicillin (penicillin V) in combination with oxymetazoline or placebo administered via a variety of nasal delivery systems. Oxymetazoline was not significantly different from placebo. Controlled prospective studies are lacking to support the use of decongestants in acute sinusitis."
"Do antiarrhythmics prevent sudden death in patients with heart failure
In severe heart failure many deaths are sudden and are presumed to be due to ventricular arrhythmias. The GESICA trial evaluated the effect of low-dose amiodarone on two-year mortality in patients with severe heart failure. Our prospective multicentre trial included 516 patients on optimal standard treatment for heart failure. Patients were randomised to 300 mg/day amiodarone (260) or to standard treatment (256). Intention-to-treat analysis showed 87 deaths in the amiodarone group (33.5%) compared with 106 in the control group (41.4%) (risk reduction 28%; 95% CI 4%-45%; log rank test p = 0.024). There were reductions in both sudden death (risk reduction 27%; p = 0.16) and death due to progressive heart failure (risk reduction 23%; p = 0.16). Fewer patients in the amiodarone group died or were admitted to hospital due to worsening heart failure (119 versus 149 in the control group; risk reduction 31%; 95% CI 13-46%; p = 0.0024). The decrease in mortality and hospital admission was present in all subgroups examined and independent of the presence of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia. Side-effects were reported in 17 patients (6.1%); amiodarone was withdrawn in 12. Low-dose amiodarone proved to be an effective and reliable treatment, reducing mortality and hospital admission in patients with severe heart failure independently of the presence of complex ventricular arrhythmias.","A randomized controlled trial in heart failure showed a significant ARR of 2.9% for sudden death, but was unblinded."
"What are the most effective ways you can help patients stop smoking
Nicotine receptor partial agonists may help people to stop smoking by a combination of maintaining moderate levels of dopamine to counteract withdrawal symptoms (acting as an agonist) and reducing smoking satisfaction (acting as an antagonist). Varenicline was developed as a nicotine receptor partial agonist from cytisine, a drug widely used in central and eastern Europe for smoking cessation. The first trial reports of varenicline were released in 2006, and further trials have now been published or are currently underway. The primary objective of this review is to assess the efficacy and tolerability of nicotine receptor partial agonists, including varenicline and cytisine, for smoking cessation. We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group's specialised register for trials, using the terms ('varenicline' or 'cytisine' or 'Tabex' or 'nicotine receptor partial agonist') and 'smoking' in the title or abstract, or as keywords. We also searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO and CINAHL using MeSH terms and free text, and we contacted authors of trial reports for additional information where necessary. The latest search was in September 2010. We included randomized controlled trials which compared the treatment drug with placebo. We also included comparisons with bupropion and nicotine patches where available. We excluded trials which did not report a minimum follow-up period of six months from start of treatment. We extracted data on the type of participants, the dose and duration of treatment, the outcome measures, the randomization procedure, concealment of allocation, and completeness of follow up.The main outcome measured was abstinence from smoking after at least six months from the beginning of treatment. We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence, and preferred biochemically validated rates where they were reported. Where appropriate we performed meta-analysis to produce a risk ratio, using the Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect model. We found 11 trials of varenicline compared with placebo for smoking cessation; three of these included a bupropion experimental arm. We also found one relapse prevention trial, comparing varenicline with placebo, and two open-label trials comparing varenicline with nicotine replacement therapy (NRT). We also include one trial in which all the participants were given varenicline, but received behavioural support either online or by phone calls, or by both methods. This trial is not included in the analyses, but contributes to the data on safety and tolerability. The included studies covered >10,300 participants, 6892 of whom used varenicline. We identified one trial of cytisine (Tabex) for inclusion.The pooled risk ratio (RR) (10 trials, 4443 people, excluding one trial evaluating long term safety) for continuous abstinence at six months or longer for varenicline at standard dosage versus placebo was 2.31 (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.01 to 2.66). Varenicline at lower or variable doses was also shown to be effective, with an RR of 2.09 (95% CI 1.56 to 2.78; 4 trials, 1272 people). The pooled RR for varenicline versus bupropion at one year was 1.52 (95% CI 1.22 to 1.88; 3 trials, 1622 people). The RR for varenicline versus NRT for point prevalence abstinence at 24 weeks was 1.13 (95% CI 0.94 to 1.35; 2 trials, 778 people). The two trials which tested the use of varenicline beyond the 12-week standard regimen found the drug to be well-tolerated during long-term use. The main adverse effect of varenicline was nausea, which was mostly at mild to moderate levels and usually subsided over time. Post-marketing safety data raised questions about a possible association between varenicline and depressed mood, agitation, and suicidal behaviour or ideation. The labelling of varenicline was amended in 2008, and the manufacturers produced a Medication Guide. Thus far, surveillance reports and secondary analyses of trial data lend little support to a causal relationship.The one cytisine trial included in this review found that more participants taking cytisine stopped smoking compared with placebo at two-year follow up, with an RR of 1.61 (95% CI 1.24 to 2.08). Varenicline at standard dose increased the chances of successful long-term smoking cessation between two- and threefold compared with pharmacologically unassisted quit attempts. Lower dose regimens also conferred benefits for cessation, while reducing the incidence of adverse events. More participants quit successfully with varenicline than with bupropion. Two open-label trials of varenicline versus NRT suggested a modest benefit of varenicline but confidence intervals did not rule out equivalence. Limited evidence suggests that varenicline may have a role to play in relapse prevention. The main adverse effect of varenicline is nausea, but mostly at mild to moderate levels and tending to subside over time. Possible links with serious adverse events, including depressed mood, agitation and suicidal thoughts, have been reported but are so far not substantiated.There is a need for further independent community-based trials of varenicline, to test its efficacy and safety in smokers with varying co-morbidities and risk patterns. There is a need for further trials of the efficacy of treatment extended beyond 12 weeks. Cytisine may also increase the chances of quitting, but the evidence at present is inconclusive.","Varenicline, a partial agonist at the Α4β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, aids smoking cessation by relieving nicotine withdrawal symptoms. A Cochrane meta-analysis concluded that varenicline resulted in significantly greater continuous abstinence at 12 months than placebo (OR=3.22; 95% CI, 2.43-4.27; NNT=8; 95% CI, 5-11)."
"Does antepartum perineal massage reduce intrapartum lacerations
To study the effects of antenatal perineal massage on subsequent perineal outcomes at delivery. A randomised, single-blind prospective study. Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Watford General Hospital. Eight hundred and sixty-one nulliparous women with singleton pregnancy and fulfilling criteria for entry to the trial between June 1994 and October 1995. Comparison of the group assigned to massage with the group assigned to no massage showed a reduction of 6.1% in second or third degree tears or episiotomies. This corresponded to tear rates of 75.1% in the no-massage group and 69.0% in the massage group (P = 0.073). There was a corresponding reduction in instrumental deliveries from 40.9% to 34.6% (P = 0.094). After adjustment for mother's age and infant's birthweight these reductions achieved statistical significance (P = 0.024 and P = 0.034, respectively). Analysis by mother's age showed a much larger benefit due to massage in those aged 30 and over and a smaller benefit in those under 30. Antenatal perineal massage appears to have some benefit in reducing second or third degree tears or episiotomies and instrumental deliveries. This effect was stronger in the age group 30 years and above.","Beginning at 34 weeks, women or their partners performed perineal massage for 4 minutes, 3 to 4 times a week. Massage was performed by inserting 1 or 2 fingers 3 to 5 cm into the vagina and sweeping downward and from side to side, using almond oil for lubrication."
"What is the best way to screen for breast cancer in women with implants
It is thought that implants interfere with breast cancer diagnosis and that cancers in women who have had breast augmentation carry a worse prognosis. A prospective breast cancer database was reviewed, comparing augmented and nonaugmented patients for details of histology, palpability, tumor size, nodal status, mammographic status, receptor status, nuclear grade, stage, and outcome. Ninety-nine cancers in augmented women and 2857 cancers in nonaugmented women were identified. Among these women, mammography was normal in 43% of those who had had augmentation and in 5% of those who had not. Augmented women were more likely to have palpable cancers (83% vs. 59%) and nodal involvement (48% vs. 36%), and less likely to have ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) (18% vs. 28%). When comparing only women younger than 50, the differences in invasiveness and nodal status lost significance. Cancers diagnosed in the 1990s were more likely to be nonpalpable and noninvasive than those diagnosed in the 1980s. This trend was more pronounced in the augmented population. Augmented patients were more likely to have palpable cancers, although the overall stage and outcome were similar to those of nonaugmented women. Although there have been significant improvements in our ability to diagnose early breast cancer over the past two decades, mammography continues to be suboptimal in augmented women.",A study of 2956 cancer patients found that mammography detected an abnormal breast mass in 66.3% of augmented women compared with 94.6% of nonaugmented women (P=.001). No significant differences were noted in cancer characteristics at diagnosis or survival rates (P=.78). The authors of this study concluded that mammography should be used for augmented women until a more effective screening tool is found.
"What is the best way to screen for breast cancer in women with implants
Recent years have witnessed growing concerns about the possible adverse effects of implants on breast cancer diagnosis and treatment. Numerous reports describe how implants might interfere with mammography and impair the ability to detect cancer. Several publications document the diminished sensitivity of mammography in augmented patients with palpable tumors. However, epidemiologic studies comparing stage of disease at time of diagnosis in augmented and nonaugmented women are equivocal. The purpose of this study was to review the authors' experience with a large number of breast cancer patients to determine whether implants impair early diagnosis or adversely affect prognosis. The authors reviewed their prospective database, which contains detailed information on 3953 nonaugmented and 129 augmented breast cancer patients. Various parameters of the two groups were compared and differences were analyzed using appropriate statistical methodology. The authors' data reveal that augmented patients present with a statistically greater frequency of palpable lesions, have a slightly greater risk of invasive tumors, and have an increased likelihood of axillary lymph node metastases. Despite this, there was no statistically significant difference in stage of disease between augmented and nonaugmented patients; mean tumor size, recurrence rates, and breast cancer-specific survival were virtually identical in both groups. Based on these findings, the authors conclude that despite the diminished sensitivity of mammography in women with implants, augmented and nonaugmented patients are diagnosed at a similar stage and have a comparable prognosis. While implants may impair mammography, they appear to facilitate detection of palpable breast cancers on physical examination.","A 2006 study of 4082 breast cancer patients concluded that mammography yielded a false-negative rate of 41.4% in augmented patients compared with 8.8% in nonaugmented patients (P<.0001). However, both augmented (n=129) and nonaugmented (n=3953) women had a comparable prognosis at diagnosis. The authors of the studies suggested diagnostic mammography for augmented patients and correlation with physical exam findings."
"What is the best way to screen for breast cancer in women with implants
Breast augmentation is not associated with an increased risk of breast cancer; however, implants may interfere with the detection of breast cancer thereby delaying cancer diagnosis in women with augmentation. To determine whether mammography accuracy and tumor characteristics are different for women with and without augmentation. A prospective cohort of 137 women with augmentation and 685 women without augmentation diagnosed with breast cancer between January 1, 1995, and October 15, 2002, matched (1:5) by age, race/ethnicity, previous mammography screening, and mammography registry, and 10 533 women with augmentation and 974 915 women without augmentation and without breast cancer among 7 mammography registries in Denver, Colo; Lebanon, NH; Albuquerque, NM; Chapel Hill, NC; San Francisco, Calif; Seattle, Wash; and Burlington, Vt. Comparison between women with and without augmentation of mammography performance measures and cancer characteristics, including invasive carcinoma or ductal carcinoma in situ, tumor stage, nodal status, size, grade, and estrogen-receptor status. Among asymptomatic women, the sensitivity of screening mammography based on the final assessment was lower in women with breast augmentation vs women without (45.0% [95% confidence interval [CI], 29.3%-61.5%] vs 66.8% [95% CI, 60.4%-72.8%]; P =.008), and specificity was slightly higher in women with augmentation (97.7% [95% CI, 97.4%-98.0%] vs 96.7% [95% CI, 96.6%-96.7%]; P<.001). Among symptomatic women, both sensitivity and specificity were lower for women with augmentation compared with women without but these differences were not significant. Tumors were of similar stage, size, estrogen-receptor status, and nodal status but tended to be lower grade (P =.052) for women with breast augmentation vs without. Breast augmentation decreases the sensitivity of screening mammography among asymptomatic women but does not increase the false-positive rate. Despite the lower accuracy of mammography in women with augmentation, the prognostic characteristics of tumors are not influenced by augmentation.","A 2004 prospective cohort study of 986,270 women found that, among asymptomatic women diagnosed with breast cancer (40 augmented, 238 nonaugmented), the sensitivity of screening mammograms was lower in women with breast implants (45%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 29.3%-61.5%) than those without (66.8%; 95% CI, 60.4%-72.8%); P=.008). Similarly, in symptomatic women diagnosed with breast cancer (41 augmented, 145 nonaugmented), screening sensitivity was lower in the augmented women (73.2%) than the nonaugmented women (81.4%)-although the results weren't significant (P=.25). Despite lower screening sensitivity, breast tumors in asymptomatic women, whether augmented or not, had similar characteristics, except for larger tumor size (3 mm) at diagnosis in augmented women. Symptomatic women with breast implants had cancers that were smaller, lower-grade, and more likely to be estrogen receptor dependent and invasive (P=.052) compared with nonaugmented women. The authors concluded that augmentation doesn't influence the prognostic characteristics of tumors, and they recommended screening mammography at appropriate intervals."
"Does treatment with donepezil improve memory for patients with mild cognitive impairment
Mild cognitive impairment is a transitional state between the cognitive changes of normal aging and early Alzheimer's disease. In a double-blind study, we evaluated subjects with the amnestic subtype of mild cognitive impairment. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive 2000 IU of vitamin E daily, 10 mg of donepezil daily, or placebo for three years. The primary outcome was clinically possible or probable Alzheimer's disease; secondary outcomes were cognition and function. A total of 769 subjects were enrolled, and possible or probable Alzheimer's disease developed in 212. The overall rate of progression from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease was 16 percent per year. As compared with the placebo group, there were no significant differences in the probability of progression to Alzheimer's disease in the vitamin E group (hazard ratio, 1.02; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.74 to 1.41; P=0.91) or the donepezil group (hazard ratio, 0.80; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.57 to 1.13; P=0.42) during the three years of treatment. Prespecified analyses of the treatment effects at 6-month intervals showed that as compared with the placebo group, the donepezil group had a reduced likelihood of progression to Alzheimer's disease during the first 12 months of the study (P=0.04), a finding supported by the secondary outcome measures. Among carriers of one or more apolipoprotein E epsilon4 alleles, the benefit of donepezil was evident throughout the three-year follow-up. There were no significant differences in the rate of progression to Alzheimer's disease between the vitamin E and placebo groups at any point, either among all patients or among apolipoprotein E epsilon4 carriers. Vitamin E had no benefit in patients with mild cognitive impairment. Although donepezil therapy was associated with a lower rate of progression to Alzheimer's disease during the first 12 months of treatment, the rate of progression to Alzheimer's disease after three years was not lower among patients treated with donepezil than among those given placebo.","The donepezil group had significantly higher rates diarrhea, muscle cramps, insomnia, nausea, and abnormal dreams (P<.01). There was no difference in discontinuation rates between the groups."
"Does furosemide decrease morbidity or mortality for patients with diastolic or systolic dysfunction
The effect of ibopamine and furosemide in 130 patients with NYHA Class I and II heart failure were studied in a parallel, double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled multi-centre trial. Ibopamine 200 mg b.i.d. was compared to furosemide 40 mg q.d. and placebo. A 1- to 2-week single-blind run-in period was followed by an 8-week double-blind treatment period. Reproducible treadmill exercise test times with the modified Naughton-Balke protocol were required for randomization. Exercise times increased significantly in comparison to the placebo group after 8 weeks of therapy for both the furosemide group (1.2 min, P < 0.035) and the ibopamine group (1.3 min, P < 0.025). Neither furosemide nor ibopamine affected quality of life assessments. Adverse clinical experiences were generally mild and similar in frequency amongst the three treatment groups. The results of this study show the usefulness of both ibopamine and furosemide as monotherapy in patients with mild congestive heart failure.","A placebo-controlled trial assessed quality of life, edema, and New York Heart Association (NYHA) class, and demonstrated no change in these outcomes in the treatment and placebo groups."
"Does furosemide decrease morbidity or mortality for patients with diastolic or systolic dysfunction
To summarise the current evidence from randomised controlled trials for diuretics in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF). English-language randomised controlled trials and review papers referenced in Medline, Embase between 1966 and 1999. General literature review of pertinent journals was carried out and reference lists of papers were inspected. REVIEW METHOD: Meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials of diuretic therapy in patients with CHF. Studies were included if they were randomised comparisons of loop or thiazide diuretics and control, or one diuretic and another active agent (e.g. ACE inhibitors, ibopamine and digoxin). Using a standardised protocol, two reviewers independently abstracted the data and assessed the methodological quality of each paper. The odds ratio (OR) of treated group compared with control was estimated for each end-point outcome and plotted against each other using the fixed-effects model. THE MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcomes of our analysis were effects of diuretics on mortality and morbidity. Eighteen trials met our criteria and were eligible for analysis, involving 928 patients. Eight trials were placebo-controlled. We analysed the data for mortality and for worsening heart failure. A further ten trials compared diuretics against other agents such as ACE inhibitors, ibopamine, and digoxin. Mortality data were available in three of the placebo-controlled trials (n=221); the mortality rate was lower for patients treated with diuretics than for control [the odds ratio for death, 0.25; 95% confidence intervals (CI), 0.07-0.84; P=0.03]. Admissions for worsening heart failure in the four small trials (n=448) showed an odds ratio of 0.31 (95% CI 0.15-0.62; P=0.001). In six studies of diuretics compared to active control, diuretics significantly improved exercise capacity in patients with CHF [OR: 0.37; CI: 0.10-0.64, P=0.007]. Compared to active control, diuretics appear to reduce the risk of worsening disease and improve exercise capacity. The available data from small studies show that in CHF conventional diuretics reduce the risk of death and worsening heart failure compared to placebo.","Faris et al conducted a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials that used diuretics (pertanide, furosemide, furosemide-hydrochlorothiazide) in congestive heart failure (TABLE).4 Of the 18 trials, 8 were placebo-controlled and 10 used active controls (diuretics vs angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors, digoxin, or ibopamine, a dopamine agonist). Three placebo-controlled trials (N=221) showed an absolute risk reduction in death of 8% in diuretic-treated patients (number needed to treat [NNT]=12.5). Four placebo-controlled trials (N=448) showed a significantly lower rate of admissions for worsening failure among diuretic-treated patients (NNT=8.5), and 4 of the active-controlled trials (N=150) showed a nonsignificant trend toward decreased admissions. Six active-controlled studies (N=174) showed significantly increased exercise capacity for patients on diuretics. The studies used in this meta-analysis had numerous shortcomings: the individual trials had small numbers of patients (N=14-139), short follow-up periods (typically 4-8 weeks), and inadequate statistical power to clearly demonstrate morbidity/mortality reductions. There was significant heterogeneity between studies. Crossover studies were included, some studies did not clearly report masking and assessment of outcome measures, and assessment of study validity was not clear. Studies employed a variety of diuretic types and doses, used different controls, and did not clarify whether patients' congestive heart failure was caused primarily by diastolic or systolic dysfunction."
"Can counseling prevent or treat postpartum depression
Approximately 10% to 16% of women experience a major depressive episode after childbirth. A significant proportion of these women also suffer from comorbid anxiety disorders. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether the addition of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) to standard antidepressant therapy offers additional benefits in the treatment of post-partum depression with comorbid anxiety disorders. Thirty-five women referred to a tertiary care hospital outpatient program with a DSM-IV diagnosis of postpartum depression with comorbid anxiety disorder were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups-paroxetine-only monotherapy group (N = 16) or paroxetine plus 12 sessions of CBT combination therapy group (N = 19)-for a 12-week trial. Progress was monitored by a psychiatrist blinded to treatment group, using the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety, Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale, Clinical Global Impressions scale, and Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. Data were analyzed using 2-tailed statistical tests at an alpha level of.05. The study was conducted from April 1, 2002, to June 30, 2003. Both treatment groups showed a highly significant improvement (p <.01) in mood and anxiety symptoms. Groups did not differ significantly in week of recovery, dose of paroxetine at remission, or measures of depression, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms at outcome. Antidepressant monotherapy and combination therapy with antidepressants and CBT were both efficacious in reducing depression and anxiety symptoms. However, in this sample of acutely depressed/anxious postpartum women, there were no additional benefits from combining the 2 treatment modalities. Further research into the efficacy of combination therapy in the treatment of moderate-to-severe depression with comorbid disorders in postpartum women is recommended.","A small RCT (N=35) compared 12 weeks of paroxetine with a combination of paroxetine and CBT. Significant improvements-defined as percentage of patients in each group demonstrating at least a 50% score reduction on the HAM-D (paroxetine, 87.5%; combination, 78.9%) and EPDS (paroxetine, 61.5%; combination, 58.3%)-occurred in both groups (P<.01), but no difference was found between the groups. The study didn't include a placebo control group."
"What is the best way to manage phantom limb pain
New studies of the treatment of neuropathic pain have increased the need for an updated review of randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials to support an evidence based algorithm to treat neuropathic pain conditions. Available studies were identified using a MEDLINE and EMBASE search. One hundred and five studies were included. Numbers needed to treat (NNT) and numbers needed to harm (NNH) were used to compare efficacy and safety of the treatments in different neuropathic pain syndromes. The quality of each trial was assessed. Tricyclic antidepressants and the anticonvulsants gabapentin and pregabalin were the most frequently studied drug classes. In peripheral neuropathic pain, the lowest NNT was for tricyclic antidepressants, followed by opioids and the anticonvulsants gabapentin and pregabalin. For central neuropathic pain there is limited data. NNT and NNH are currently the best way to assess relative efficacy and safety, but the need for dichotomous data, which may have to be estimated retrospectively for old trials, and the methodological complexity of pooling data from small cross-over and large parallel group trials, remain as limitations.","Although PLP is typically treated as neuropathic pain, only a few medications have been critically evaluated for treating it."

"What is appropriate fetal surveillance for women with diet-controlled gestational diabetes
Pregnancy in patients with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is associated with increased perinatal morbidity. Whether the perinatal mortality rate, particularly the fetal death rate, is greater in these patients remains controversial. The present study was undertaken to review the role of antepartum fetal monitoring in 69 patients with GDM controlled by diet only (class A) and 28 women requiring insulin therapy (class AB). Hypertension complicated 21.6% of these pregnancies. Antepartum fetal surveillance included outpatient nonstress testing, urinary estriol assays, maternal assessment of fetal activity, and clinical estimation of fetal weight. All insulin-requiring patients as well as fourteen class A patients with identifiable risk factors underwent testing. No perinatal deaths occurred. Only six patients required intervention for suspected fetal jeopardy and four of these women had hypertension. Macrosomia was correctly identified in only 6 of 16 infants weighing 4000 g or more. This study suggests that, in GDM, an outpatient program of fetal testing, using primarily the nonstress test and maternal assessment of fetal activity, can be employed in patients requiring insulin as well as class A patients with identifiable risk factors. This protocol resulted in a low rate of unnecessary intervention and good perinatal outcome. The risks for abnormal antepartum testing results appear increased in GDM with hypertension and prolonged pregnancy.","A retrospective study followed 97 pregnant patients with gestational diabetes, 69 of whom were diet-controlled (class A1, fasting glucose <105 mg/dL).5 Antepartum surveillance consisted of maternal monitoring and non-stress testing. At 28 weeks, pregnant patients assessed daily fetal activity; reassuring fetal well-being was defined as 10 fetal movements in a 12-hour period. At 40 weeks, a non-stress test was performed weekly. Contraction stress testing was performed for those with nonreactive non-stress tests. To observe for macrosomia, serial ultrasonography was performed every 4 to 6 weeks, starting at 28 weeks. Forty-four patients (64%) had spontaneous labors without intervention, while the rest required induction of labor or cesarean section (primary or failed induction). Five patients had primary cesarean section for suspected macrosomia, 3 patients had intervention for suspected intrauterine growth restriction, and only 4 (5.7%) patients were delivered due to fetal indications, defined as decreased fetal movement or a nonreactive nonstress test. No stillbirths or neonatal deaths occurred. Perinatal complications included hypoglycemia (n=13; 19%), hyperbilirubinemia (n=12; 17%), and macrosomia (n=11; 16%). The study did not compare complication rates between diet-controlled and insulin-requiring patients."
"What treatment works best for tennis elbow
To investigate the efficacy of physiotherapy compared with a wait and see approach or corticosteroid injections over 52 weeks in tennis elbow. Single blind randomised controlled trial. Community setting, Brisbane, Australia. 198 participants aged 18 to 65 years with a clinical diagnosis of tennis elbow of a minimum six weeks' duration, who had not received any other active treatment by a health practitioner in the previous six months. Eight sessions of physiotherapy; corticosteroid injections; or wait and see. Global improvement, grip force, and assessor's rating of severity measured at baseline, six weeks, and 52 weeks. Corticosteroid injection showed significantly better effects at six weeks but with high recurrence rates thereafter (47/65 of successes subsequently regressed) and significantly poorer outcomes in the long term compared with physiotherapy. Physiotherapy was superior to wait and see in the short term; no difference was seen at 52 weeks, when most participants in both groups reported a successful outcome. Participants who had physiotherapy sought less additional treatment, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, than did participants who had wait and see or injections. Physiotherapy combining elbow manipulation and exercise has a superior benefit to wait and see in the first six weeks and to corticosteroid injections after six weeks, providing a reasonable alternative to injections in the mid to long term. The significant short term benefits of corticosteroid injection are paradoxically reversed after six weeks, with high recurrence rates, implying that this treatment should be used with caution in the management of tennis elbow.","In an RCT, physiotherapy and exercise were significantly better than a wait-and-see approach at 6 weeks for pain-free grip force, rating of pain severity, and global improvement (RR=0.5; 99% CI, 0.2-0.8; NNT=3), but by 52 weeks the outcomes were statistically equal."
"Prophylactic oxytocin: Before or after placental delivery
To determine if the timing of the administration of prophylactic oxytocin influences the incidence of postpartum hemorrhage caused by uterine atony, retained placenta, and third-stage duration. Parturients who presented for vaginal delivery were randomized in a double-blinded fashion to receive oxytocin, 20 units in a 500-mL crystalloid intravenous bolus, beginning upon delivery of either the fetal anterior shoulder or placenta. For all patients, the third stage of labor was managed with controlled cord traction until placental expulsion, followed by at least 15 seconds of fundal massage. Patients were excluded if they had a previous cesarean section, multiple gestation, antepartum hemorrhage, or bleeding disorder. A total of 1486 patients were enrolled: 745 in the before-placenta group and 741 in the after-placenta group. The groups were similar with respect to gestational age, fetal weight, labor duration, maternal age, parity, and ethnicity. The incidence of postpartum hemorrhage did not differ significantly between the two groups (5.4% vs 5.8%; crude OR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.59 to 1.43). There were no significant differences between the two groups with respect to incidence of retained placenta (2.4% vs 1.6%; OR, 1.49; 95% CI, 0.72 to 3.08), or third-stage duration (7.7 minutes vs 8.1 minutes; P =.23). The administration of prophylactic oxytocin before placental delivery does not reduce the incidence of postpartum hemorrhage or third-stage duration, when compared with giving oxytocin after placental delivery. Early administration, however, does not increase the incidence of retained placenta.","A well-constructed double-blinded RCT found no significant difference in the incidence of PPH when oxytocin was given after delivery of the anterior shoulder or the placenta. The study included 1486 patients; 745 received 20 units of oxytocin on delivery of the anterior shoulder, and 741 received an identical dose of oxytocin on delivery of the placenta. The incidence of PPH was 5.4% for the anterior shoulder group and 5.8% for the placenta group (P=.72). Likewise, no significant difference between the groups was noted in the proportion of women with estimated blood loss (EBL) ≥500 mL (7.5% vs 9.7%; P=.15)."
"What causes a low TSH level with a normal free T4 level
To investigate the effects of long term thyroid hormone suppressive therapy on the heart, 20 patients were evaluated by noninvasive techniques. Of them, 10 were athyreotic after surgery for differentiated thyroid cancer, and 10 had diffuse or nodular goiter. The mean age of the group was 39 +/- 11 yr. Twenty age- and sex-matched subjects served as controls. The mean dose of levothyroxine was 163 +/- 34 micrograms daily. Plasma TSH was undetectable in all patients. Mean serum T4, free T4, and sex hormone-binding globulin were significantly higher (P < 0.001), whereas mean serum T3, free T3, and osteocalcin did not differ from control levels. Cardiac evaluation consisted of a standard 12-lead electrocardiogram, an ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring (Holter), and an echocardiographic study. Two patients showed abnormal electrocardiograms for left ventricular hypertrophy. Holter demonstrated an increase in average heart rate (84 +/- 7 vs. 70 +/- 6 beats/min; P < 0.01). Prevalence of atrial premature beats was higher in the patient group than in the control group (100% vs. 60%; P < 0.006). The echocardiogram showed an increased left ventricular mass index in the patient group (97 +/- 24 vs. 80 +/- 18 g/m2; P < 0.02). Furthermore, left ventricular systolic function was enhanced, with higher values of fractional shortening (38 +/- 7% vs. 34 +/- 4%; P < 0.05) and rate-adjusted velocity of shortening (1.2 +/- 0.13 vs. 1.05 +/- 0.14 circumferences/sec; P < 0.01). These findings indicate that long term levothyroxine therapy at suppressive doses markedly affects cardiac function.","Patients with SCH have been reported to have increased heart rate, contractility, left ventricular mass, and increased risk of diastolic dysfunction and atrial arrhythmias."
"Who should get hepatitis A vaccination
Travelers to developing countries participated in a follow-up study of the health risks associated with short (less than three months) visits to these nations. Travelers to the Greek or Canary Islands served as a control cohort. Participants completed a questionnaire to elicit information regarding pretravel vaccinations, malaria prophylaxis, and health problems during and after their journey. Relevant infections were confirmed by the respondent's personal physician. The questionnaire was completed by 10,524 travelers; the answer rate was 73.8%. After a visit to developing countries, 15% of the travelers reported health problems, 8% consulted a doctor, and 3% were unable to work for an average of 15 days. The incidence of infection per month abroad was as follows: giardiasis, 7/1,000; amebiasis, 4/1,000; hepatitis, 4/1,000; gonorrhea, 3/1,000; and malaria, helminthiases, or syphilis, less than 1/1,000.

"What is the best way to distinguish type 1 and 2 diabetes
To clarify whether random C-peptide is a valuable test in the classification of diabetes. All C-peptide measurements conducted in the diabetic population of Skaraborg (280,539 inhabitants and 3.2% diabetes) between 1995 and 1998 (3,115 samples) were considered, but only patients with well-defined diabetes type (1,449 samples from 1,093 patients) were analyzed for the correlation between diabetes type and C-peptide concentration. Serum C-peptide was measured after fasting over night (fCP), after glucagon stimulation (gCP), and randomly (rCP) without considering previous meals at an ordinary visit to the diabetic clinic (rCP). Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed to illustrate the power of the different C-peptide protocols and to determine the optimal cut-off values. Although all three tests had high discriminative power, the ROC curves demonstrated that rCP was superior to fCP and gCP in discriminating type 1 from type 2 diabetes. The optimal cut-off value for rCP was 0.50 nmol/L, for fCP 0.42 nmol/L, and for gCP 0.60 nmol/L. rCP is more powerful than fCP and gCP in distinguishing type 1 from type 2 diabetes and can therefore be recommended as a classification tool, particularly in outpatients.","Although daily variation in serum insulin levels limits its use, C-peptide levels show more promise. Random C-peptide levels were superior to fasting or glucagon stimulated levels in 1093 patients, who were followed for 3 years to confirm insulin requirements. Using a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, the area under the curve for random C-peptide levels to distinguish diabetes types was 0.98 (95% CI, 0.97-0.99). For patients under the optimal cutoff of 0.5 nmol/L, the positive predictive value was 96% for diagnosing type 1 and the likelihood ratio was 22.5."
"What are the indications for treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme ACE inhibitors in patients with diabetes
Angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been used for more than a decade to treat high blood pressure, despite the lack of data from randomised intervention trials to show that such treatment affects cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The Captopril Prevention Project (CAPPP) is a randomised intervention trial to compare the effects of ACE inhibition and conventional therapy on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with hypertension. CAPPP was a prospective, randomised, open trial with blinded endpoint evaluation. 10,985 patients were enrolled at 536 health centres in Sweden and Finland. Patients aged 25-66 years with a measured diastolic blood pressure of 100 mm Hg or more on two occasions were randomly assigned captopril or conventional antihypertensive treatment (diuretics, beta-blockers). Analysis was by intention-to-treat. The primary endpoint was a composite of fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, and other cardiovascular deaths. Of 5492 patients assigned captopril and 5493 assigned conventional therapy, 14 and 13, respectively, were lost to follow-up. Primary endpoint events occurred in 363 patients in the captopril group (11.1 per 1000 patient-years) and 335 in the conventional-treatment group (10.2 per 1000 patient-years; relative risk 1.05 [95% CI 0.90-1.22], p=0-52). Cardiovascular mortality was lower with captopril than with conventional treatment (76 vs 95 events; relative risk 0.77 [0.57-1-04], p=0.092), the rate of fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction was similar (162 vs 161), but fatal and non-fatal stroke was more common with captopril (189 vs 148; 1.25 [1-01-1-55]. p=0.044). Captopril and conventional treatment did not differ in efficacy in preventing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The difference in stroke risk is probably due to the lower levels of blood pressure obtained initially in previously treated patients randomised to conventional therapy.",There is no evidence that ACE inhibitors are superior to b-blockers or diuretics in preventing cardiovascular outcomes at similar levels of blood pressure reduction.
"What is the best treatment for diabetic neuropathy
To determine the relative efficacy and adverse effects of antidepressants and anticonvulsants in the treatment of diabetic neuroapathy and postherpetic neuralgia, published reports were identified from a variety of electronic databases, including Medline, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library and the Oxford Pain Relief Database, and from two previously published reviews. Additional studies were identified from the reference lists of retrieved reports. The relative benefit (RB) and number-needed-to-treat (NNT) for one patient to achieve at least 50 % pain relief was calculated from available dichotomous data, as was the relative risk (RR) and number-needed-to-harm (NH) for minor adverse effects and drug related study withdrawal. In diabetic neuropathy, 16 reports compared antidepressants with placebo (491 patient episodes) and three compared anticonvulsants with placebo (321). The NNT for at least 50 % pain relief with antidepressants was 3.4 (95 % confidence interval 2.6-4. 7) and with anticonvulsants 2. 7 (2. 2-3. 8). In postherpetic neuralgia, three reports compared antidepressants with placebo (145 patient episodes) and one compared anticonvulsants with placebo (225), giving an NNT with antidepressants of 2.1 (1. 7-3) and with anticonvulsants 3.2 (2.4-5). There was little difference in the incidence of minor adverse effects with either antidepressants or anticonvulsants compared with placebo, with 1VH (minor) values of about 3. For drug-related study withdrawal, antidepressants had an NNH (major) of 17 (11-43) compared with placebo, whereas with anticonvulsants there was no significant difference from placebo. Antidepressants and anticonvulsants had the same efficacy and incidence of minor adverse effects in these tzoo neuropathic pain conditions. There was no evidence that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) were better than older antidepressants, and no evidence that gabapentin was better than older anticonvulsants. In these trials patients were more likely to stop taking antidepressants than anticonvulsants because of adverse effects.","A well-done meta-analysis summarized available randomized placebo-controlled trials of antidepressants (including tricyclics and SSRIs) and anticonvulsants (including phenytoin, carbamazepine, and gabapentin). Almost all trials compare individual agents against placebo, and there have been no head-to-head trials that address functional outcomes, quality of life, patient satisfaction, or cost. Most trials do not describe diagnostic criteria, consider causes of pain other than diabetes or address diabetic control, which is known to predict frequency of neuropathy. Finally, very few trials include typical primary care patients in a primary care setting or control for important confounding variables such as over-the-counter medications or comorbid illnesses. Within the constraints of this literature, placebos have a substantial impact, with an aggregate 32% of patients receiving placebo reporting at least 50% reduction in pain. A total of 16 trials have addressed the efficacy of antidepressants for diabetic neuropathy. Compared with placebo, tricyclic antidepressants have an aggregate NNT of 3.5 (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.6-4.7) for patients reporting at least 50% reduction of pain, along with an NNH of 2.7 (95% CI, 2.1-3.9) for minor adverse effects (typically the muscarinic effects of dry mouth, constipation, and blurred vision) and 17 (95% CI, 10-43) for side effects severe enough to cause withdrawal from a trial. Dosages were in the low to middle range of those used to treat depression; there was no significant difference in efficacy between trials less than 3 weeks and those greater than 3 weeks. A total of 4 randomized placebo-controlled trials (1 each for phenytoin [Dilantin], carbamazepine [Tegretol], gabapentin [Neurontin], and valproate [Depakote]) have extractable data about the efficacy of anticonvulsants for the pain of diabetic neuropathy. As a class, the NNT for patients reporting at least a 50% reduction in pain was 2.7 (95% CI, 2.2-3.8); the NNH for minor adverse effects (typically transient central nervous system effect such as dizziness, somnolence, or disturbance in gait) was 2.7 (95% CI, 2.2-3.4)."
"Do inhaled beta-agonists control cough in URIs or acute bronchitis
The optimal treatment for acute bronchitis is not clear. Because many patients with acute bronchitis have airflow limitation as well as cough, beta2-agonists may be useful. To determine whether beta2-agonists improve the symptoms of acute bronchitis in patients who do not have underlying pulmonary disease. The Cochrane Library (through August 2000), MEDLINE (1966 to 2000), EMBASE (1974 to 2000), and Conference Proceedings using ""bronchodilator (exp)"", ""adrenergic beta-agonist (exp)"", or ""sympathomimetics (exp)"" and ""bronchitis"" or ""cough""; Science Citation Index for referenced publications; and letters to manufacturers of beta2-agonists. An updated search of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (issue 3, 2003); MEDLINE (January 2000 to July 2003); EMBASE (January 2000 to July 2003) was run in July 2003. Trials in which patients (adults or children over two years of age) without known pulmonary disease who were diagnosed with acute bronchitis or acute cough without other cause were randomized to beta2-agonist versus placebo, no treatment, or alternative treatment. Three reviewers independently first selected outcomes and evaluated trial quality while blinded to study results, and then extracted data. Trials in children and in adults were analyzed separately. Two trials in children (n = 109) with acute cough and no evidence of airway obstruction did not find any benefits from beta2-agonists. Combined data did not show a significant difference in daily cough scores between patients given oral beta2-agonists and those in the control groups. Five trials in adults (n = 418) with acute cough or acute bronchitis had mixed results, but overall summary statistics did not reveal any significant benefits from oral (three trials) nor inhaled (two trials) beta2-agonists. There were no significant differences in daily cough scores nor in the number of patients still coughing after seven days (control rate 73%; RR = 0.77, 95% CI 0.54-1.09). Subgroups of patients with evidence of airflow limitation had lower symptom scores if given beta2-agonists in one trial; and the trials that did note quicker resolution of cough in patients given beta2-agonists were those that had a higher proportion of patients with wheezing at baseline. Patients given beta2-agonists were more likely to report tremor, shakiness, or nervousness than patients in the control groups (for trials in children control rate 0%; RR 6.76, 95% CI 0.86 to 53.12, NNH 9, 95% CI 5 to 100; for trials in adults, control rate 11%; RR 7.94, 95% CI 1.17 to 53.94, NNH 2.3, 95% CI 2 to 3). There is no evidence to support using beta2-agonists in children with acute cough who do not have evidence of airflow obstruction. There is also little evidence that the routine use of beta2-agonists for adults with acute cough is helpful. These agents may reduce symptoms, including cough, in patients with evidence of airflow obstruction; but this potential benefit is not well-supported by the available data and must be weighed against the adverse effects associated with beta2-agonists.","A systematic review looking at beta-agonists for acute bronchitis included the clinical diagnoses of both acute bronchitis and acute cough because a standard definition of bronchitis is lacking. Only two trials in this review examined inhaled beta-agonists. When results from these trials were combined for the outcome of productive cough at 7 days, inhaled beta-agonists showed no benefit. However, the authors note that details of the individual trials may help to clarify the effect of inhaled beta-agonists."
"Do inhaled beta-agonists control cough in URIs or acute bronchitis
Previous research has suggested that cough associated with acute bronchitis is more likely to subside within 7 days when treated with albuterol than with an antibiotic. This study examines the effectiveness of aerosolized albuterol for the treatment of acute bronchitis in patients treated with erythromycin or placebo. A double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled trial of albuterol delivered by metered-dose inhaler (MDI) was conducted in a primary care setting with healthy adult patients who presented with a productive cough of fewer than 30 days' duration. In addition to randomization for albuterol, patients were also randomized to receive erythromycin or placebo. Outcomes were assessed at follow-up after 7 days. Patients treated with albuterol MDI were less likely to be coughing after 7 days of treatment than were patients using a placebo inhaler (61% still coughing vs 91%, P = .02). When analysis was stratified by cigarette smoking status and the use of erythromycin, the differences observed between albuterol MDI patients and controls persisted. Albuterol appears to reduce the likelihood that patients with acute bronchitis will be coughing after 7 days following initiation of treatment. This effect appears to be independent of cigarette smoking or the concomitant use of antibiotics.","One trial, a randomized controlled trial of adult patients with acute bronchitis in 2 community-based family practices, compared 23 patients receiving albuterolin a multidose inhaler (MDI) with 23 patients receiving placebo inhaler. Patients were also randomized to receive erythromycin or placebo tablets. Patients with pneumonia or a history of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were excluded. At 7 days, 61% of patients in the albuterol group reported cough compared with 91% in the control group (P=.02, NNT=3). No statistically significant difference was seen in productive cough or night cough. Smokers responded to inhaled albuterol similarly to nonsmokers. Erythromycin had no effect on cough and side effects were similar among all groups."
"Does yoga speed healing for patients with low back pain
The purpose of this randomized pilot study was to evaluate a possible design for a 6-week modified hatha yoga protocol to study the effects on participants with chronic low back pain. Twenty-two participants (M = 4; F = 17), between the ages of 30 and 65, with chronic low back pain (CLBP) were randomized to either an immediate yoga based intervention, or to a control group with no treatment during the observation period but received later yoga training. A specific CLBP yoga protocol designed and modified for this population by a certified yoga instructor was administered for one hour, twice a week for 6 weeks. Primary functional outcome measures included the forward reach (FR) and sit and reach (SR) tests. All participants completed Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) questionnaires. Guiding questions were used for qualitative data analysis to ascertain how yoga participants perceived the instructor, group dynamics, and the impact of yoga on their life. To account for drop outs, the data were divided into better or not categories, and analyzed using chi-square to examine differences between the groups. Qualitative data were analyzed through frequency of positive responses. Potentially important trends in the functional measurement scores showed improved balance and flexibility and decreased disability and depression for the yoga group but this pilot was not powered to reach statistical significance. Significant limitations included a high dropout rate in the control group and large baseline differences in the secondary measures. In addition, analysis of the qualitative data revealed the following frequency of responses (1) group intervention motivated the participants and (2) yoga fostered relaxation and new awareness/learning. A modified yoga-based intervention may benefit individuals with CLB, but a larger study is necessary to provide definitive evidence. Also, the impact on depression and disability could be considered as important outcomes for further study. Additional functional outcome measures should be explored. This pilot study supports the need for more research investigating the effect of yoga for this population.","A randomized controlled trial studied a 6-week modified hatha yoga protocol with 22 patients. The yoga group spent an hour with a certified instructor twice weekly, while the control group received the same intervention delayed until the study phase was completed. This underpowered pilot study found trends in functional measurement scores for improved balance and flexibility, as well as decreased disability and depression in the yoga group, but the sample size was too small to detect significant changes."
"Should we screen women for hypothyroidism
In a study at a primary care centre in a predominantly rural area of Sweden the records of all patients with established thyroid disease were scrutinised and 2000 consecutive adult patients screened with an immunoenzymometric thyroid stimulating hormone assay. The aims of the study were fourfold: firstly, to assess the total burden of thyroid disease in primary care centres in Sweden; secondly, to assess the efficacy of clinical diagnosis of the disease in unselected populations of patients; thirdly, to assess the efficacy of clinical evaluation of treatment with thyroxine; and, lastly, to see whether a single analysis of the serum thyroid stimulating hormone concentration by recent methods would be enough to identify an abnormality of thyroid function. Of the roughly 17,400 adults in the study community, 111 women and 10 men were being treated for thyroid disease. Screening detected 68 patients (3.5%) not receiving thyroxine who had a serum thyroid stimulating hormone concentration of 0.20 mU/l or less, all of whom were followed up clinically. Fifty of these patients were also studied biochemically during follow up. Only nine of the 68 patients had thyroid disease (three with thyrotoxicosis requiring treatment), no evidence of the disease being found in the remainder. Sixteen patients had spontaneous hypothyroidism requiring treatment, and neither these nor three patients with thyrotoxicosis had been detected at the preceding clinical examination. Of 35 patients in whom thyroid disease was suspected clinically at screening, none had laboratory evidence of thyroid dysfunction. In this series 1.3% of all women in the study community (2.6% of all 50-59 year olds) and 0.1% of the men were being treated for thyroid disease at the primary care centre, roughly 1.0% of adults subjected to screening were found to have thyroid disease requiring treatment, and most patients with a thyroid stimulating hormone concentration of 0.20 mU/l or less did not have thyroid dysfunction. It is concluded that measuring the basal serum thyroid stimulating hormone concentration by present methods is insufficient for the biochemical assessment of thyroid dysfunction in unselected populations.","In a cohort study, 2000 adults from a primary care population underwent history and physical and TSH testing. The TSH screen identified 19 cases of hypothyroidism not found by history and physical, while the history and physical prompted evaluation of 35 patients without abnormal TSH."
"Is there a role for theophylline in treating patients with asthma
To determine whether children with severe acute asthma treated with large doses of inhaled salbutamol, inhaled ipratropium, and intravenous steroids are conferred any further benefits by the addition of aminophylline given intravenously. Randomised, double blind, placebo controlled trial of 163 children admitted to hospital with asthma who were unresponsive to nebulised salbutamol. The placebo and treatment groups of children were similar at baseline. The 48 children in the aminophylline group had a greater improvement in spirometry at six hours and a higher oxygen saturation in the first 30 hours. Five subjects in the placebo group were intubated and ventilated after enrollment compared with none in the aminophylline group. Aminophylline continues to have a place in the management of severe acute asthma in children unresponsive to initial treatment.",The largest RCT of aminophylline in children demonstrated a reduced intubation rate (NNT = 14 CI: 7.8-77). Children receiving aminophylline experienced more vomiting (RR = 3.69; 95%CI: 2.15-6.33).
"Is there a role for theophylline in treating patients with asthma
Inhaled glucosteroids and oral theophylline are widely used to treat asthma. We compared the benefits of adding theophylline to inhaled glucosteroid with those of doubling the dose of inhaled glucosteroid in patients with persistent symptoms despite the use of inhaled glucosteroid. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we randomly assigned 62 patients to receive either 400 microg of inhaled budesonide (low-dose budesonide) with 250 or 375 mg of theophylline (depending on body weight) or 800 microg of inhaled budesonide (high-dose budesonide). All doses were given twice daily for three months. Lung function was measured serially, and patients kept records of peak expiratory flow, symptoms, and albuterol use. The effects of treatment on endogenous cortisol levels were also assessed. Both treatments resulted in improvements in lung function that were sustained throughout the study. As compared with treatment with high-dose budesonide, treatment with low-dose budesonide plus theophylline resulted in greater improvements in forced vital capacity (P=0.03) and forced expiratory volume in one second (P= 0.03). There were significant and similar reductions in beta2-agonist use and the variability of peak expiratory flow, a correlate of bronchial hyperresponsiveness and the severity of asthma. Serum cortisol concentrations were significantly reduced in the group given high-dose budesonide (from a mean [+/-SE] of 18.4+/-2.4 microg per deciliter to 15.9+/-2.1 microg per deciliter, P=0.02) but were unchanged in the other group. The median serum theophylline concentration was 8.7 microg per milliliter (therapeutic range, 10 to 20) among those who received theophylline. Both treatments were well tolerated. For patients with moderate asthma and persistent symptoms, low-dose inhaled budesonide with theophylline and high-dose inhaled budesonide produced similar benefits. Effects were achieved at theophylline concentrations below the recommended therapeutic range. The addition of low-dose theophylline to inhaled glucosteroid may be preferable to and cheaper than increasing the dose of inhaled glucosteroid.","When added to low-dose ICS for maintenance, theophylline was as effective as high-dose ICS alone in improving FEV 1 , decreasing day and night symptoms, and reducing the need for rescue medications and the incidence of attacks. This suggests theophylline has utility as a steroid sparing agent."
"Are any oral iron formulations better tolerated than ferrous sulfate
The effectiveness of orally administered iron was investigated using three different iron preparations in a randomized study with 3 patient groups, each consisting of 20 subjects with iron deficiency anaemia. Group A received a ferric(III)-dextrin complex, group B Fe(II)-sulfate, and group C Fe(II)-fumarate with vitamins. For all three preparations the increase in the number of erythrocytes as well as hemoglobin and hematocrit values ran absolutely parallel for a period of 12 weeks. A relevant difference between the trivalent ferric-dextrin complex and the two bivalent iron preparations could not be detected on evaluation of the parameters measured except for a moderate increase in the transaminase values in the patients group who received the Fe(II)-sulfate preparation. No differences were found among the preparations with respect to tolerance. The results are discussed with respect to a possible overloading of the iron transport system by highly absorptive Fe(II)-preparations.",A study of 60 subjects taking both preparations on an empty stomach found no difference in side-effect rates.
"Other than anticoagulation, what is the best therapy for those with atrial fibrillation
This review summarizes the available evidence regarding the efficacy of medications used for ventricular rate control, stroke prevention, acute conversion, and maintenance of sinus rhythm, as well as the efficacy of electrical cardioversion and the use of echocardiography in patients with atrial fibrillation. The Cochrane Collaboration's database of controlled clinical trials and MEDLINE. Primarily randomized, controlled trials of medications. Paired reviewers obtained data on efficacy and safety. Strength of evidence was assessed. Recent clinical trial results showed that most patients with atrial fibrillation have similar outcomes with strategies for controlling ventricular rate compared with strategies for restoring sinus rhythm. For efficacy of primary stroke prevention, compared with placebo, evidence was strong for warfarin and suggestive for aspirin. The evidence for an increased risk for major bleeding was suggestive for warfarin and inconclusive for aspirin. For ventricular rate control, verapamil, diltiazem, atenolol, and metoprolol were qualitatively superior to digoxin and placebo, particularly during exercise. For efficacy of acute conversion, compared with placebo, evidence was strong for ibutilide, flecainide, dofetilide, propafenone, amiodarone, and quinidine. For efficacy of maintenance of sinus rhythm after conversion from atrial fibrillation, evidence was strong for amiodarone, propafenone, disopyramide, and sotalol. Echocardiography was found to be useful in estimating risk for thromboembolism and potentially useful in estimating likelihood of successful cardioversion and maintenance. For several key questions in the pharmacologic management of atrial fibrillation, strong evidence exists to support 1 or more treatment options.","A meta-analysis of 60 RCTs evaluated 8 drugs for acute cardioversion. Ibutilide, flecainide, dofetilide, propafenone, and amiodarone were found to have the strongest evidence of efficacy. There was moderate evidence for quinidine and insufficient evidence for disopyramide and sotalol. Studies of pharmacologic conversion suffer from small ample size, short follow-up, and variable duration of atrial fibrillation. A review of limited research reveals an 80% to 85% immediate success rate for DC cardioversion, with rare side-effects of ventricular tachycardia, transient AV node dysfunction, and significant skin blistering."
"What is the best way to diagnose a suspected rotator cuff tear
To evaluate the evidence for the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the newer diagnostic imaging tests as an addition to clinical examination and patient history for the diagnosis of soft tissue shoulder disorders. Literature was identified from several sources including general medical databases. Studies were identified that evaluated clinical examination, ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or magnetic resonance arthrography (MRA) in patients suspected of having soft tissue shoulder disorders. Outcomes assessed were clinical impingement syndrome or rotator cuff tear (full, partial or any). Only cohort studies were included. The methodological quality of included test accuracy studies was assessed using a formal quality assessment tool for diagnostic studies and the extraction of study findings was conducted in duplicate using a pre-designed and piloted data extraction form to avoid any errors. For each test, sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative likelihood ratios with 95% confidence intervals were calculated for each study. Where possible pooled estimates of sensitivity, specificity and likelihood ratios were calculated using random effects methods. Potential sources of heterogeneity were investigated by conducting subgroup analyses. In the included studies, the prevalence of rotator cuff disorders was generally high, partial verification of patients was common and in many cases patients who were selected retrospectively because they had undergone the reference test. Sample sizes were generally very small. Reference tests were often inappropriate with many studies using arthrography alone, despite problems with its sensitivity. For clinical assessment, 10 cohort studies were found that examined either the accuracy of individual tests or clinical examination as a whole: individual tests were either good at ruling out rotator cuff tears when negative (high sensitivity) or at ruling in such disorders when positive (high specificity), but small sample sizes meant that there was no conclusive evidence. Ultrasound was investigated in 38 cohort studies and found to be most accurate when used for the detection of full-thickness tears; sensitivity was lower for detection of partial-thickness tears. For MRI, 29 cohort studies were included. For full-thickness tears, overall pooled sensitivities and specificities were fairly high and the studies were not statistically heterogeneous; however for the detection of partial-thickness rotator cuff tears, the pooled sensitivity estimate was much lower. The results from six MRA studies suggested that it may be very accurate for detection of full-thickness rotator cuff tears, although its performance for the detection of partial-thickness tears was less consistent. Direct evidence for the performance of one test compared with another is very limited. The results suggest that clinical examination by specialists can rule out the presence of a rotator cuff tear, and that either MRI or ultrasound could equally be used for detection of full-thickness rotator cuff tears, although ultrasound may be better at picking up partial tears. Ultrasound also may be more cost-effective in a specialist hospital setting for identification of full-thickness tears. Further research suggestions include the need for large, well-designed, prospective studies of the diagnosis of shoulder pain, in particular a follow-up study of patients with shoulder pain in primary care and a prospective cohort study of clinical examination, ultrasound and MRI, alone and/or in combination.","In a systematic review of 38 cohort studies, the overall sensitivity and specificity of ultrasound for full-thickness rotator cuff tears was 0.87 (95% CI, 0.84-0.89) and 0.96 (95% CI, 0.94-0.97). For partial-thickness tears, ultrasound sensitivity was 0.67 (95% CI, 0.61-0.73). Positive and negative predictive values of a test depend on the prevalence of the condition in the study population. In the case of rotator cuff tears, such differences in prevalence of rotator cuff tears in the 38 cohort studies left it unclear whether a negative ultrasound could reliably rule out a tear."

"What is appropriate management of iron deficiency for young children
To compare the effect of unmodified cows' milk and iron supplemented formula milk on psychomotor development in infants from inner city areas when used as the main milk source. Double blind, randomised intervention trial. Birmingham health centre. 100 infants, mean age 7.8 months (range 5.7 to 8.6 months), whose mothers had already elected to use unmodified cows' milk as their infant's milk source. Changing to an iron supplemented formula milk from enrolment to 18 months of age, or continuing with unmodified cows' milk. Developmental assessments using Griffiths scales at enrolment and at 18 and 24 months. 85 participants completed the trial. There were no significant differences in haemoglobin concentration between the two groups at enrolment, but by 18 months of age 33% of the unmodified cows' milk group, but only 2% of the iron supplemented group, were anaemic (P<0.001). The experimental groups had Griffiths general quotient scores that were not significantly different at enrolment, but the scores in both groups declined during the study. By 24 months the decrease in the mean scores in the unmodified cows' milk group was 14.7 whereas the decrease in the mean scores in the iron supplemented group was 9.3 (P<0.02, 95% confidence interval 0.4 to 10.4). Mean subquotient scores were considerably lower in the unmodified cows' milk group at 24 months; significantly so for personal and social scores (P<0.02, 1.2 to 16.8 [corrected]). Replacing unmodified cows' milk with an iron supplemented formula milk up to 18 months of age in infants from inner city areas prevents iron deficiency anaemia and reduces the decline in psychomotor development seen in such infants from the second half of the first year.","In a RCT of innercity children who had been switched to cow's milk by 6 months, half (n=50) were randomized to receive iron-fortified formula for another year, resulting in a decreased risk of anemia at 24 months (0% vs 26%, NNT=4), and smaller declines in developmental functioning compared with those on cow's milk."
"What is appropriate management of iron deficiency for young children
The pediatrician is faced with a difficult challenge in providing recommendations for optimal nutrition in older infants. Because the milk (or formula) portion of the diet represents 35% to 100% of total daily calories and because WCM and breast milk or infant formula differ markedly in composition, the selection of a milk or formula has a great impact on nutrient intake. Infants fed WCM have low intakes of iron, linoleic acid, and vitamin E, and excessive intakes of sodium, potassium, and protein, illustrating the poor nutritional compatibility of solid foods and WCM. These nutrient intakes are not optimal and may result in altered nutritional status, with the most dramatic effect on iron status. Infants fed iron-fortified formula or breast milk for the first 12 months of life generally maintain normal iron status. No studies have concluded that the introduction of WCM into the diet at 6 months of age produces adequate iron status in later infancy; however, recent studies have demonstrated that iron status is significantly impaired when WCM is introduced into the diet of 6-month-old infants. Data from studies abroad of highly iron-deficient infant populations suggest that infants fed partially modified milk formulas with supplemental iron in a highly bioavailable form (ferrous sulfate) may maintain adequate iron status. However, these studies do not address the overall nutritional adequacy of the infant's diet. Such formulas have not been studied in the United States. Optimal nutrition of the infant involves selecting the appropriate milk source and eventually introducing infant solid foods.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",The AAP recommends that parents should refrain from feeding cow's milk to infants until after age 12 months and introduce iron-enriched foods between ages 4 and 6 months.
"What is the best management for patients who have a TIA while on aspirin therapy
In 1988, we undertook a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial to investigate the safety and efficacy of low-dose acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), modified-release dipyridamole, and the two agents in combination for secondary prevention of ischemic stroke. Patients with prior stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) were randomized to treatment with ASA alone (50 mg daily), modified-release dipyridamole alone (400 mg daily), the two agents in a combined formulation, or placebo. Primary endpoints were stroke, death, and stroke or death together. TIA and other vascular events were secondary endpoints. Patients were followed on treatment for two years. Data from 6,602 patients were analysed. Factorial analysis demonstrated a highly significant effect for ASA and for dipyridamole in reducing the risk of stroke (p < or = 0.001) and stroke or death combined (p < 0.01). In pairwise comparisons, stroke risk in comparison to placebo was reduced by 18% with ASA alone (p = 0.013); 16% with dipyridamole alone (p = 0.039); and 37% with combination therapy (p < 0.001). Risk of stroke or death was reduced by 13% with ASA alone (p = 0.016); 15% with dipyridamole alone (p = 0.015); and 24% with the combination (p < 0.001). The treatment had no statistically significant effect on the death rate alone. Factorial analysis also demonstrated a highly significant effect of ASA (p < 0.001) and dipyridamole (p < 0.01) for preventing TIA. The risk reduction for the combination was 36% (p < 0.001) in comparison with placebo. Headache was the most common adverse event, occurring more frequently in dipyridamole-treated patients. All-site bleeding and gastrointestinal bleeding were significantly more common in patients who received ASA in comparison to placebo or dipyridamole. We conclude that (1) ASA 25 mg twice daily and dipyridamole, in a modified-release form, at a dose of 200 mg twice daily have each been shown to be equally effective for the secondary prevention of ischemic stroke and TIA; (2) when co-prescribed the protective effects are additive, the combination being significantly more effective than either agent prescribed singly; (3) low-dose ASA does not eliminate the propensity for induced bleeding.","A large-scale RCT including patients with previous stroke or TIA concluded that the combination of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole reduced the occurrence of stroke by 23% (P<.001) compared with aspirin (number needed to treat [NNT]=35; 95% CI, 20-130). In this trial, patients with a prior TIA comprised only one quarter of the patients studied. Subgroup analyses of patients on aspirin prior to experiencing a TIA have not been reported."
"When should patients with asymptomatic aortic stenosis be evaluated for valve replacement
Whether to perform valve replacement in patients with asymptomatic but severe aortic stenosis is controversial. Therefore, we studied the natural history of this condition to identify predictors of outcome. During 1994, we identified 128 consecutive patients with asymptomatic, severe aortic stenosis (59 women and 69 men; mean [+/-SD] age, 60+/-18 years; aortic-jet velocity, 5.0+/-0.6 m per second). The patients were prospectively followed until 1998. Follow-up information was available for 126 patients (98 percent) for a mean of 22+/-18 months. Event-free survival, with the end point defined as death (8 patients) or valve replacement necessitated by the development of symptoms (59 patients), was 67+/-5 percent at one year, 56+/-5 percent at two years, and 33+/-5 percent at four years. Five of the six deaths from cardiac disease were preceded by symptoms. According to multivariate analysis, only the extent of aortic-valve calcification was an independent predictor of outcome, whereas age, sex, and the presence or absence of coronary artery disease, hypertension, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia were not. Event-free survival for patients with no or mild valvular calcification was 92+/-5 percent at one year, 84+/-8 percent at two years, and 75+/-9 percent at four years, as compared with 60+/-6 percent, 47+/-6 percent, and 20+/-5 percent, respectively, for those with moderate or severe calcification. The rate of progression of stenosis, as reflected by the aortic-jet velocity, was significantly higher in patients who had cardiac events (0.45+/-0.38 m per second per year) than those who did not have cardiac events (0.14+/-0.18 m per second per year, P<0.001), and the rate of progression of stenosis provided useful prognostic information. Of the patients with moderately or severely calcified aortic valves whose aortic-jet velocity increased by 0.3 m per second or more within one year, 79 percent underwent surgery or died within two years of the observed increase. In asymptomatic patients with aortic stenosis, it appears to be relatively safe to delay surgery until symptoms develop. However, outcomes vary widely. The presence of moderate or severe valvular calcification, together with a rapid increase in aortic-jet velocity, identifies patients with a very poor prognosis. These patients should be considered for early valve replacement rather than have surgery delayed until symptoms develop.",A study followed 128 patients for 4 years and found that moderate to severe valvular calcification and an increase in jet velocity of 0.3 m/s/year were the best prognostic predictors. Almost 80% of those with both calcification and a rapid change in jet velocity underwent surgery or died within 2 years.
"Should liver enzymes be checked in a patient taking niacin
To compare escalating doses of immediate-release (IR) and sustained-release (SR) niacin for effectiveness in reducing levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides and increasing levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and for the occurrence of adverse reactions, especially hepatotoxicity. Randomized, double-blind, parallel comparison of IR and SR niacin administered sequentially at 500, 1000, 1500, 2000, and 3000 mg/d, each for 6 weeks. Cholesterol research center. Forty-six adults, 23 in each group, with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels greater than 4.14 mmol/L (160 mg/dL) after 1 month of a step 1 National Cholesterol Education Program diet. Fourteen-hour fasting lipid and lipoprotein cholesterol levels, results of clinical laboratory tests, a symptom questionnaire, and withdrawal rates. The SR niacin lowered low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels significantly more than IR niacin did at the dosage of 1500 mg/d and above, while IR niacin increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels significantly more than SR niacin did at all dosage levels. The reduction in triglyceride levels was similar with IR and SR niacin. Nine (39%) of the 23 patients assigned to the IR dosage form withdrew before completing the 3000-mg daily dose; the most common reasons for withdrawal were vasodilatory symptoms, fatigue, and acanthosis nigricans. Eighteen (78%) of the 23 patients assigned to the SR dosage form withdrew before completing the 3000-mg daily dose; the most common reasons for withdrawal were gastrointestinal tract symptoms, fatigue, and increases in levels of liver aminotransferases, often with symptoms of hepatic dysfunction. None of the patients taking IR niacin developed hepatotoxic effects, while 12 (52%) of the 23 patients taking SR niacin did. The SR form of niacin is hepatotoxic and should be restricted from use. The IR niacin is preferred for the management of hypercholesterolemia but can also cause significant adverse effects and should be given only to patients who can be carefully monitored by experienced health professionals.","In a small prospective comparative study of IR and LA/SR niacin (n=46), 0/23 patients taking IR niacin exhibited hepatic toxicity, compared with 12/23 (52%) of patients taking the LA/SR formulation. In this study, patients receiving 1 g/d of LA/SR niacin had increases in transaminases similar to those of patients on 3 g/d of IR niacin. It is therefore recommended that if a patient cannot tolerate IR niacin and is switched to the LA/SR form, the dosage be reduced by 50% to 70%. At doses >2 g/d of LA/SR niacin, mean transaminases approached 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), supporting recommendations not to exceed this dose for LA/SR niacin."
"What vitamins and minerals should be given to breastfed and bottle-fed infants
Iron supplements are often prescribed during infancy but their benefits and risks have not been well documented. We examined whether iron supplements affect growth or morbidity of breast-fed infants. Full-term infants in Sweden (n = 101) and Honduras (n = 131) were randomly assigned to three groups at 4 mo of age: 1) placebo from 4 to 9 mo; 2) placebo from 4 to 6 mo and iron supplements [1 mg/(kg. d)] from 6 to 9 mo; or 3) iron supplements from 4 to 9 mo. All infants were exclusively or nearly exclusively breast-fed to 6 mo and continued to be breast-fed to at least 9 mo. Growth was measured monthly and morbidity data were collected every 2 wk. Among the Swedish infants, gains in length and head circumference were significantly lower in those who received iron than in those given placebo from 4 to 9 mo. The same effect on length was seen in Honduras, but only at 4-6 mo among those with initial hemoglobin (Hb) > or =110 g/L. There was no significant main effect of iron supplementation on morbidity, nor any significant interaction between iron supplementation and site, but for diarrhea (with both sites combined), there was an interaction between iron supplementation and initial Hb. Among infants with Hb < 110 g/L at 4 mo, diarrhea was less common among those given iron than in those given placebo from 4-9 mo, whereas the opposite was true among those with Hb > or = 110 g/L (P < 0.05). We conclude that routine iron supplementation of breast-fed infants may benefit those with low Hb but may present risks for those with normal Hb.","A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled iron supplementation trial involved 214 exclusively breastfed infants from 4 to 9 months of age in Sweden and Honduras. Iron supplementation did not affect weight gain in the groups, but length gain from ages 4 to 9 months was less in the iron-supplemented groups than in the placebo group (P<.05 for placebo vs Fe). This effect was greater in Sweden, and only existed in Honduras for infants aged 4 to 6 months with initial mean Hgb of at least 11 mg/dL. The researchers conclude that iron supplementation may pose risks in iron-replete infants."

"For fibromyalgia, which treatments are the most effective
Fibromyalgia (FMS) is a syndrome expressed by chronic widespread body pain which leads to reduced physical function and frequent use of health care services. Exercise training is commonly recommended as a treatment. The objective of this systematic review was to examine the efficacy of exercise training as an treatment for FMS. We searched 6 electronic bibliographies for studies of exercise training in FMS: MEDLINE (1966-12/2000), CINAHL (1982-12/2000), HealthSTAR (1990-12/2000), Sports Discus (1975-05/2000), EMBASE (1974-05/2000) and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (2000, issue 4). We also reviewed the reference lists from identified articles including reviews and meta-analyses of treatment studies. Randomized trials focused on cardiorespiratory endurance, muscle strength and/or flexibility as treatment for FMS were selected. Two reviewers independently identified trials meeting inclusion criteria, rated the methodologic quality using 2 standardized validated instruments, evaluated the adequacy of the exercise training stimulus using the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) criteria and evaluated the results. Disagreements were resolved through active discussion and consensus. High quality training studies had scores of 50% or greater on van Tulder methodologic criteria and met the minimum training standards of ACSM. Outcome variables were grouped into 7 constructs: pain, tender points, physical function, global well being, self efficacy, fatigue & sleep, and psychological function. Two reviewers independently extracted data on study characteristics, results and point estimates for selected variables, and used consensus to address discrepancies. Sixteen trials involving a total of 724 participants were assigned at random to: exercise intervention groups (n=379), control groups (n=277), or groups receiving an alternate treatment (n=68). Seven studies were high quality training studies: 4 aerobic training, 1 a mixture of aerobic, strength and flexibility training, 1 strength training and 2 with exercise training as part of a composite treatment. Flexibility protocols were never described in sufficient detail to allow evaluation. The four high quality aerobic training studies reported significantly greater improvements in the exercise groups versus control groups in aerobic performance (17.1% increase in aerobic performance with exercise versus 0.5% increase in the control groups), tender point pain pressure threshold (28.1% increase versus 7.0% decrease) and improvements in pain (11.4% decrease in pain versus 1.6% increase). Poor description of exercise protocols was common, with insufficient information on intensity, duration, frequency and mode of exercise. Adverse events were also poorly reported. Supervised aerobic exercise training has beneficial effects on physical capacity and FMS symptoms. Strength training may also have benefits on some FMS symptoms. Further studies on muscle strengthening and flexibility are needed. Research on the long-term benefit of exercise for FMS is needed.","A systematic review assessing various exercise programs on symptoms of fibromyalgia showed that aerobic exercise produces short-term improvements in cardiovascular fitness, tender-point pressure pain threshold, and patient- and physicianrated global well-being. Three of these trials included long-term follow-up of the exercise group participants. Patients who continued exercising maintained their improved physical functioning."
"Is surgery effective for reducing symptoms in adults with obstructive sleep apnea
Obstructive sleep apnoea is the periodic reduction (hypopnoea) or cessation (apnoea) of airflow during sleep. The syndrome is associated with loud snoring, disrupted sleep and observed apnoeas. Beside conservative treatments there are a range of 8 broad categories of operative treatments for this condition. Surgical treatments aim to relieve the obstruction by either increasing the surface area Surgery for obstructive sleep apnoea aims to relieve the obstruction by increasing the surface area of the airway, bypassing the pharyngeal airways or removing a lesion. The objective of this review was to assess the effects of any type of surgery for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnoea. We searched the Cochrane Airways Group trials register and reference lists of articles. We contacted experts in the field, research dissemination bodies and other Cochrane Review Groups. Randomised and quasi-randomised trials comparing any surgical intervention for obstructive sleep apnoea with other surgical or non-surgical interventions for obstructive sleep apnoea or no intervention. No completed trials were identified. No studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. There is an urgent need for high quality randomised controlled trials to be carried out in the field of surgery for obstructive sleep apnoea. More research should also be undertaken to identify and standardise techniques to determine the site of airways obstructions.","Current recommendations in favor of surgical therapy are based solely on case series, poorly designed trials, expert opinion or pathophysiologic reasoning."
"What is the best initial treatment of Parkinson's disease
The long-term effectiveness of three different initial drug regimes in patients with early, mild PD was evaluated by the PD Research Group of the United Kingdom (PDRGUK). In 1995, the selegiline arm of the trial was terminated following an interim analysis. This was an open, randomized trial. Between 1985 and 1990, 782 patients with de-novo PD were recruited and randomized to one of three treatment arms: levodopa plus dopa decarboxylase inhibitor; levodopa plus decarboxylase inhibitor and selegiline; or bromocriptine. The main endpoints were mortality, disability, and adverse events. Intention-to-treat analysis was used. There was no significant difference in mortality between the bromocriptine and the levodopa arms (hazard ratio 1.15 [95% CI 0.90, 1.47]). Patients initially randomized to bromocriptine had slightly worse disability scores throughout follow-up. This difference was significant during the first years. Patients in the bromocriptine arm returned to pretreatment disability levels one year earlier than those in the levodopa arm. Patients randomized to bromocriptine had a significantly lower incidence of dyskinesias than those randomized to levodopa (rate ratio 0.73 [95% CI 0.57, 0.93]). However, this difference was not significant when only moderate to severe dyskinesias were considered. Patients in the bromocriptine arm had slightly lower rates of dystonias and on-off fluctuations, but moderate and severe forms were equally frequent in both arms. Starting treatment with the dopamine agonist bromocriptine does not reduce mortality in PD. A slightly lower incidence of motor complications is achieved at the expense of significantly worse disability scores throughout the first years of therapy.","A large randomized controlled trial comparing bromocriptine with levodopa demonstrated that at 3 years, disability scores were lower in the patients initially assigned to bromocriptine, but the difference was no longer significant at 9 years. The bromocriptine group in this trial showed a lower incidence of dyskinesias when data from all patient groups were combined. However, when moderate to severe cases were analyzed separately, there was no significant difference."
"What is the most effective nicotine replacement therapy
The aim of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is to replace nicotine from cigarettes. This reduces withdrawal symptoms associated with smoking cessation thus helping resist the urge to smoke cigarettes. The aims of this review were to determine the effectiveness of the different forms of nicotine replacement therapy (chewing gum, transdermal patches, nasal spray, inhalers and tablets) in achieving abstinence from cigarettes, or a sustained reduction in amount smoked; to determine whether the effect is influenced by the clinical setting in which the smoker is recruited and treated, the dosage and form of the NRT used, or the intensity of additional advice and support offered to the smoker; to determine whether combinations of NRT are more effective than one type alone; and to determine its effectiveness compared to other pharmacotherapies. We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group trials register in July 2002. Randomized trials in which NRT was compared to placebo or no treatment, or where different doses of NRT were compared. We excluded trials which did not report cessation rates, and those with follow-up of less than six months. We extracted data in duplicate on the type of subjects, the dose and duration and form of nicotine therapy, the outcome measures, method of randomization, and completeness of follow-up. The main outcome measure was abstinence from smoking after at least six months of follow-up. We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence for each trial, and biochemically validated rates if available. Where appropriate, we performed meta-analysis using a fixed effects model (Peto). We identified 110 trials; 96 with a non NRT control group. The odds ratio for abstinence with NRT compared to control was 1.74 (95% confidence interval 1.64 - 1.86), The odds ratios for the different forms of NRT were 1.66 for gum, 1.74 for patches, 2.27 for nasal spray, 2.08 for inhaled nicotine and 2.08 for nicotine sublingual tablet/lozenge. These odds were largely independent of the duration of therapy, the intensity of additional support provided or the setting in which the NRT was offered. In highly dependent smokers there was a significant benefit of 4 mg gum compared with 2mg gum (odds ratio 2.67, 95% confidence interval 1.69 - 4.22). There was weak evidence that combinations of forms of NRT are more effective. Higher doses of nicotine patch may produce small increases in quit rates. Only one study directly compared NRT to another pharmacotherapy, in which bupropion was significantly more effective than nicotine patch or placebo. All of the commercially available forms of NRT (nicotine gum, transdermal patch, the nicotine nasal spray, nicotine inhaler and nicotine sublingual tablets/lozenges) are effective as part of a strategy to promote smoking cessation. They increase quit rates approximately 1.5 to 2 fold regardless of setting. The effectiveness of NRT appears to be largely independent of the intensity of additional support provided to the smoker. Provision of more intense levels of support, although beneficial in facilitating the likelihood of quitting, is not essential to the success of NRT. There is promising evidence that bupropion may be more effective than NRT (either alone or in combination). However, its most appropriate place in the therapeutic armamentarium requires further study and consideration.","A Cochrane Review of 110 trials evaluating the efficacy of nicotine replacement therapy in 35,600 smokers found higher quit rates among heavy smokers using 4-mg compared with 2-mg nicotine gum (odds ratio [OR], 2.67; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.69-4.22)."
"Is screening urinalysis in children worthwhile
Today, urinalysis is one of the most common clinical tests ordered for adult and pediatric patients. Because urine specimens are usually readily available and are obtained noninvasively, the urine testing is well suited for children. This article discusses the most common urine tests performed in children for screening purposes and also less common tests for diagnosis of specific disorders. Special considerations regarding urine specimen collection in children are discussed. Some simple tests that are underused by clinicians are mentioned, as are some exciting new molecular applications of urine testing.",Currently vailable screening urinalyses using chemical dipstick testing have reported sensitivities ranging from 53% to 93% and specificities of 72% to 98% for detecting significant bacteriuria.
"Does a high-fiber diet prevent colon cancer in at-risk patients
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in industrialized countries. Experimental evidence has supported the hypothesis that dietary fibre may be protective for the development of CRC, although epidemiologic data have been inconclusive. We have conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the effect of dietary fibre on the incidence or recurrence of colorectal adenomas, the incidence of CRC, and the development of adverse events. We identified randomized controlled trials from Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register up to Oct 2001 Randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials were assessed. The population included all subjects that had adenomatous polyps but no previous history of colorectal cancer (CRC), a documented ""clean colon"" at baseline and repeated visualization of the colon/rectum after at least two years of follow-up. Dietary fibre was the intervention. The primary outcomes were the number of subjects with: a) at least one adenoma, b) more than one adenoma, c) at least one adenoma greater than or equal to 1 cm or d) a new diagnosis of CRC. The secondary outcome was the number of adverse events. Two reviewers independently extracted data, assessed trial quality and resolved discrepancies by consensus. The outcomes were reported as relative risks (RR) and risk difference (RD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). If statistical significance was reached, the number need to treat (NNTT) or harm (NNTH) was reported. The study data were combined with the fixed effects model if it was clinically, methodologically, and statistically reasonable. Five studies with 4349 subjects met the inclusion criteria. The interventions were wheat bran fibre, ispaghula husk, or a comprehensive dietary intervention with high fibre whole food sources alone or in combination. When the data were combined there was no difference between the intervention and control groups for the number of subjects with at least one adenoma [RR 1.04 (95% CI 0.95,1.13); RD 0.01 (95% CI 0.02,0.04)]. As well, the combined results for the number of subjects with more than one adenoma [RR 1.02 (95% CI 0.89,1.17), RD 0.00 (-0.02,0.03)] or at least one adenoma 1 cm or greater [RR 0.94 (95% CI 0.77,1.15), RD -0.01 (-0.02,0.01)] were not statistically significant. Other primary and secondary outcomes and subanalyses by type of fibre intervention were not statistically or clinically significant. There is currently no evidence from RCTs to suggest that increased dietary fibre intake will reduce the incidence or recurrence of adenomatous polyps within a two to four year period.","A Cochrane meta-analysis of 5 trials including 4349 subjects of increased dietary fiber to prevent recurrence of colon adenomas found no difference between intervention and control groups for development of at least 1 adenoma relative risk [RR]=1.04; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.95-1.13."
"Does a high-fiber diet prevent colon cancer in at-risk patients
Dietary fiber has been implicated in colorectal neoplasia, despite conflicting evidence. This is a review of the currently available data on the role of dietary fiber in colorectal carcinogenesis. A literature search was conducted using the MEDLINE database. All case-control, longitudinal, and randomized, controlled studies published in English between 1988 and 2000 were identified, as were animal model studies in the period 1986 to 2000. Data from the various studies were tabulated and systematically analyzed, with particular emphasis on the effect of dietary fiber on tumor incidence and luminal parameters such as short chain fatty acids. Epidemiologic correlation studies show a high intake of dietary fiber to be associated with a lower risk of colorectal neoplasia. Thirteen of the 24 case-control studies reviewed demonstrated a protective effect of dietary fiber against colorectal neoplasia, and 16 showed a protective effect of vegetables or vegetable fiber. On the other hand, of 13 longitudinal studies in various cohorts, only 3 demonstrated a protective effect of fiber and 4 a protective effect of vegetables or vegetable fiber. The five published randomized, controlled trials all investigated the effect of increased fiber intake on short-term adenoma recurrence; however, none showed any significant protective effect. Among 19 experimental studies in animal models, 15 showed a protective effect of fiber against tumor induction compared with controls. Animal studies also showed that poorly fermentable fibers (e.g., wheat bran and cellulose) were more protective than soluble fibers (e.g., guar gum and oat bran), which sometimes enhanced carcinogenesis. No clear correlation was found between luminal pH or short chain fatty acids and tumor induction. On the basis of current data, there is little evidence to support the use of dietary fiber supplements to reduce the risk of colorectal neoplasia. Lifelong and early exposure may be important but are difficult to study. Other risk factors interact with the effects of dietary fiber.","A systematic review of dietary fiber and colorectal neoplasia (which included case-control and cohort studies as well as randomized controlled trials) showed that 13 of 24 case-control studies found an association with high dietary fiber as a possible protective factor, while only 3 of 13 longitudinal studies found such an association."
"Does stimulant therapy help adult ADHD
Despite the increasing recognition of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adults, the use of pharmacotherapeutics remains less established. A systematic review of the literature identified 15 studies (N = 435 subjects) of stimulants, and 22 studies of non-stimulant medications (N = 421 subjects) including antidepressants, antihypertensives, amino acids, and wake-promoting agents for the treatment of ADHD in adults. Studies with stimulants and antidepressants demonstrated significant short-term improvement in ADHD symptoms compared to placebo in adults. Methylphenidate (MPH) and amphetamine had an immediate onset of action whereas the ADHD response to pemoline and antidepressants appeared delayed. The response to amphetamine and MPH appears to be dose-dependent. Controlled data on nicotonic and noradrenergic compounds appear promising. There was considerable variability in diagnostic criteria, dosing parameters, and response rates between the various studies. Under controlled conditions, the aggregate literature shows that the stimulants and noradrenergic antidepressants had a clinically and statistically significant beneficial effect on treating ADHD in adults.","A less rigorous systematic review identified 15 studies of stimulant efficacy in adults. Researchers concluded that under controlled conditions, stimulants are efficacious in the treatment of ADHD in adults. The rate of response among the studies ranged from 25% to 78%."
"Does stimulant therapy help adult ADHD
There are few controlled studies of methylphenidate hydrochloride in adults with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and their results have been equivocal. The discrepancies among these studies may be related to low doses, diagnostic uncertainties, and lack of attention to comorbid disorders. We conducted a randomized, 7-week, placebo-controlled, crossover study of methylphenidate in 23 adult patients with DSM-III-R ADHD using standardized instruments for diagnosis, separate assessments of ADHD and depressive and anxiety symptoms, and a robust daily dose of methylphenidate hydrochloride, 1.0 mg/kg per day. We found a marked therapeutic response for methylphenidate treatment of ADHD symptoms that exceeded the placebo response (78% vs 4%, P < .0001). Response to methylphenidate was independent of gender, psychiatric comorbidity with anxiety or moderate depression, or family history of psychiatric disorders. Robust doses of methylphenidate are effective in the treatment of adult ADHD.","A high-quality study was a 7-week randomized controlled trial using a crossover comparison of methylphenidate and placebo. There was a favorable response in 78% (18/23) of subjects while takin methylphenidate, in contrast to 4% (1/23) while taking placebo (number needed to treat [NNT]=1.4; P<.0001). A favorable response was assessed by the Clinical Global Impression Scale, a measure of illness severity and improvement, and a >30% reduction in symptoms as measured by the ADHD Rating Scale."
"Does stimulant therapy help adult ADHD
The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy of the alpha-2a agonist guanfacine with that of dextroamphetamine for the treatment of adult attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Seventeen adult outpatients who met DSM-IV criteria for ADHD participated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study comparing drug effects on ADHD symptoms. Measures of change included the DSM-IV ADHD Behavior Checklist for Adults and the Copeland Symptom Checklist for Adult Attention Deficit Disorders. Cognitive measures of attention included the Stroop and Controlled Oral Word Association Test using the letters ""C,"" ""F,"" and ""L"" (COWAT, CFL version). For each trial, the drug was administered daily and titered up to optimal doses of maximum efficacy but with a minimum of side effects, and then data were collected. Both drugs significantly reduced ADHD symptoms on the DSM-IV Adult Behavior Checklist for Adults over placebo (p < 0.05). The Stroop Color subscale showed significant improvement for both drugs (p < 0.05), but the Color-Word measures showed significant improvement for guanfacine only (p < 0.01). The average dose of guanfacine was 1.10 (SD = 0.60), and the most common side effect of guanfacine was fatigue. No subjects discontinued drug trials. This preliminary study indicates that guanfacine may be a well-tolerated treatment option for adult ADHD.","A study compared dextroamphetamine, guanfacine (an antihypertensive agent), and placebo in 17 patients. On the DSM-IV ADHD Behavior Checklist for Adults, subjects taking dextroamphetamine or guanfacine reported similar decreases in mean ADHD scores compared with placebo (24 vs 22 vs 30; P<.05). They did not report the number of subjects who had a 30% reduction in symptoms. Of note: at the end of the study but prior to unblinding, subjects were asked which medication they preferred. Twelve subjects chose dextroamphetamine, 4 chose guanfacine, and 1 chose placebo. Subjects' stated reason for choosing dextroamphetamine was the positive effect it had on their motivation."

We report on a controlled trial of a mixed amphetamine salts compound (Adderall, dextroamphetamine sulfate, dextro-, levoamphetamine sulfate, dextroamphetamine aspartate, levoamphetamine aspartate, and dextroamphetamine saccharate) in the treatment of adult attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). This was a 7-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study of Adderall in 27 well-characterized adults satisfying full DSM-IV criteria for ADHD of childhood onset and persistent symptoms into adulthood. Medication was titrated up to 30 mg twice a day. Outcome measures included the ADHD Rating Scale and the Clinical Global Impression Score. Comorbid psychiatric disorders were assessed to test for potential effects on treatment outcome. Treatment with Adderall at an average oral dose of 54 mg (administered in 2 daily doses) was effective and well tolerated. Drug-specific improvement in ADHD symptoms was highly significant overall (42% decrease on the ADHD Rating Scale, P<.001), and sufficiently robust to be detectable in a parallel groups comparison restricted to the first 3 weeks of the protocol (P<.001). The percentage of subjects who improved (reduction in the ADHD rating scale of > or =30%) was significantly higher with Adderall treatment than with a placebo (70% vs 7%; P =.001). Adderall was effective and well tolerated in the short-term treatment of adults with ADHD. More work is needed to evaluate the long-term effects of Adderall, or other amphetamine compounds, in the treatment of adults with ADHD.","A study was a randomized controlled trial of mixed amphetamine salts. Of the 27 adults who completed the study, 19 (70%) responded favorably to mixed amphetamine salts compared with 2 (7.4%) receiving placebo (NNT=1.6; P<.001). Favorable response was defined as more than a 30% reduction of symptoms on the ADHD Rating Scale."
"Which lifestyle interventions effectively lower LDL cholesterol
This paper aims to review the evidence for long-term effectiveness of weight loss on cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and triglycerides in overweight/obese people. Current evidence is mostly based on short-term studies. A systematic review of long-term lipid outcomes of weight loss in studies published between 1966 and 2001, was conducted. Inclusion criteria included all cohort studies and trials carried out on participants with body mass index of greater than or equal to 28 kg m(-2). Studies had at least two weight change measurements and follow-up of more than 2 years. Thirteen long-term studies with a follow-up of more than 2 years were included. Cholesterol has a significant positive linear relationship with weight change (r = 0.89) where change in weight explains about 80% of the cholesterol difference variation (Adj R2 = 0.80). For every 10 kg weight loss a drop of 0.23 mmol L(-1) in cholesterol may be expected for a person suffering from obesity or are grossly overweight. Weight loss has long-term beneficial effects especially on LDL and cholesterol. Weight loss in obese patients should be encouraged and sustained.","A meta-analysis found a 0.8 mg/dL LDL-C decrease for every kg of weight lost. Long-term follow-up, however, showed that LDL-C returned to baseline even when weight loss was maintained. Eight clinical trials failed to demonstrate a reduction in LDL-C postintervention with up to 10 kg of weight loss. Studies using weight-loss drugs (Sibutramine, Orlistat) found more significant weight loss during treatment, along with greater decrease in LDL-C, when compared with studies using only lifestyle modifications."
"What hormonal contraception is most effective for obese wome
To assess the contraceptive efficacy, cycle control, tolerability, and user acceptability of a novel combined contraceptive vaginal ring for up to 13 cycles. Healthy women requesting contraception were enrolled in this 1-year multicenter study. Each ring released 120 microg of etonogestrel and 15 microg of ethinylestradiol daily, and was used for 3 weeks followed by a 1-week ring-free period. A total of 2322 women started treatment and so formed the intent-to-treat population. Subjects were followed for 23,298 cycles, equivalent to 1786 woman-years. Compliance was good with 85.6% of cycles in full compliance with specified criteria. In the intent-to-treat population, 21 pregnancies occurred, giving a Pearl Index of 1.18 (95% confidence interval 0.73, 1.80). Eleven of the pregnancies were attributable to noncompliance; the Pearl Index for the per-protocol population was 0.77 (95% confidence interval 0.37, 1.40). The mean incidence of withdrawal bleeding was 98.5% in all cycles. Irregular bleeding occurred in 5.5% of all cycles, and in most women, early or late withdrawal bleeding was restricted to spotting. The ring was well tolerated with a low incidence of adverse events; only 2.5% of all discontinuations were device related. The ring was easy to insert and remove and did not interfere with intercourse. Eighty-five percent of women were satisfied with the ring, and 90% would recommend its use to others. The ring is an effective contraceptive with excellent cycle control that is convenient, well tolerated, and highly acceptable to users.","The efficacy of the contraceptive vaginal ring does not appear to be affected by body weight, but the mean BMI in intent-to-treat population studies was only 22.9±2.9."
"Which complementary therapies can help patients with PMS
Clinical trials have demonstrated that serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) and the extract of Vitex agnus castus are effective for the treatment of premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). However, to the best of our knowledge, there has been no study comparing the efficacy of the SRIs with Vitex agnus castus (AC) extract. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to compare the efficacy of fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), with that of the AC extract, a natural choice. After a period of 2 screening months to screen the patients for suitability, 41 patients with PMDD according to DSM-IV were recruited into the study. The patients were randomized to fluoxetine or AC for 2 months of single-blind, rater- blinded and prospective treatment period. The outcome measures included the Penn daily symptom report (DSR), the Hamilton depression rating scale (HAM-D), and the clinical global impression-severity of illness (CGI-SI) and -improvement (CGI-I) scales. At endpoint, using the clinical criterion for improvement, a similar percentage of patients responded to fluoxetine (68.4%, n = 13) and AC (57.9%, n = 11). There was no statistically significant difference between the groups with respect to the rate of responders. This preliminary study suggests that patients with PMDD respond well to treatment with both fluoxetine and AC. However, fluoxetine was more effective for psychological symptoms while the extract diminished the physical symptoms.",A study comparing chasteberry tree with fluoxetine in 19 patients found a decrease in premenstrual symptom scores for both fluoxetine (13 of 19 patients) and chasteberry tree (11 of 19 patients). No statistically significant differences were noted between the 2 groups. Chasteberry tree was well tolerated; most adverse effects occurred in patients receiving fluoxetine. The most frequent adverse effects with chasteberry tree were nausea in 5 patients and headache in 4.

To compare the efficacy and tolerability of agnus castus fruit (Vitex agnus castus L extract Ze 440) with placebo for women with the premenstrual syndrome. Randomised, double blind, placebo controlled, parallel group comparison over three menstrual cycles. General medicine community clinics. Participants: 178 women were screened and 170 were evaluated (active 86; placebo 84). Mean age was 36 years, mean cycle length was 28 days, mean duration of menses was 4.5 days. Agnus castus (dry extract tablets) one tablet daily or matching placebo, given for three consecutive cycles. Main efficacy variable: change from baseline to end point (end of third cycle) in women's self assessment of irritability, mood alteration, anger, headache, breast fullness, and other menstrual symptoms including bloating. Secondary efficacy variables: changes in clinical global impression (severity of condition, global improvement, and risk or benefit) and responder rate (50% reduction in symptoms). Improvement in the main variable was greater in the active group compared with placebo group (P<0.001). Analysis of the secondary variables showed significant (P<0.001) superiority of active treatment in each of the three global impression items. Responder rates were 52% and 24% for active and placebo, respectively. Seven women reported mild adverse events (four active; three placebo), none of which caused discontinuation of treatment. Dry extract of agnus castus fruit is an effective and well tolerated treatment for the relief of symptoms of the premenstrual syndrome.",A double-blind RCT comparing chasteberry tree with placebo in 170 patients found a decrease in self-reported PMS symptom scores and an increase in response rate (defined as a 50% reduction in symptoms)-52% vs 24%-in the intervention group (number needed to treat [NNT]=3.5). Patients taking chasteberry tree had 1 occurrence of multiple abscesses and 1 of urticaria.
"Which complementary therapies can help patients with PMS
We investigated the effect of a daily supplement of 200 mg of magnesium (as MgO) for two menstrual cycles on the severity of premenstrual symptoms in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study. A daily supplement of 200 mg of Mg (as MgO) or placebo was administered for two menstrual cycles to each volunteer, who kept a daily record of her symptoms, using a 4-point scale in a menstrual diary of 22 items. Symptoms were grouped into six categories: PMS-A (anxiety), PMS-C (craving), PMS-D (depression), PMS-H (hydration), PMS-O (other), and PMS-T (total overall symptoms). Urinary Mg output/24 hours was estimated from spot samples using the Mg/creatinine ratio. Analysis of variance for 38 women showed no effect of Mg supplementation compared with placebo in any category in the first month of supplementation. In the second month there was a greater reduction (p = 0.009) of symptoms of PMS-H (weight gain, swelling of extremities, breast tenderness, abdominal bloating) with Mg supplementation compared with placebo. Compliance to supplementation was confirmed by the greater mean estimated 24-hour urinary output of Mg (p = 0.013) during Mg supplementation (100.8 mg) compared with placebo (74.1 mg). A daily supplement of 200 mg of Mg (as MgO) reduced mild premenstrual symptoms of fluid retention in the second cycle of administration.","A RCT comparing magnesium with placebo had low precision because of small numbers and short treatment duration. The study reported a decrease in fluid retention symptoms by 2 points on an 80-point scale (P<.009) at 2 months, but no difference in total score."
"Can nonantidepressants help treat depression
The addition of lithium to the treatment regimens of previously nonresponding depressed patients has been repeatedly investigated in controlled studies. The authors undertook this meta-analysis to investigate the efficacy of lithium augmentation of conventional antidepressants. An attempt was made to identify all placebo-controlled trials of lithium augmentation in refractory depression. Only double-blind studies that involved participants who had been treated with lithium or placebo addition after not responding to conventional antidepressants were to be included in the meta-analysis. Further inclusion criteria were the use of accepted diagnostic criteria for depression and the use of response criteria based on the acceptable measurement of depression as an outcome variable. Studies were located by a search of the MEDLINE database, a search in the Cochrane Library, and an intensive search by hand of reviews on lithium augmentation. Nine of 11 placebo-controlled, double-blind studies were included in this meta-analysis. Aggregating three studies with a total of 110 patients that used a minimum lithium dose of 800 mg/day, or a dose sufficient to reach lithium serum levels of > or = 0.5 mEq/L, and a minimum treatment duration of 2 weeks, the authors found that the pooled odds ratio of response during lithium augmentation compared with the response during placebo treatment was 3.31 (95% confidence interval, 1.46-7.53). The corresponding relative response rate was 2.14 (95% confidence interval, 1.23-3.70), the absolute improvement in response rate was 27% (95% confidence interval, 9.8%-44.2%), and the number of patients needed to be treated to obtain one more responder was 3.7. Inclusion of six more studies that fulfilled inclusion criteria but which treated subjects with additional lithium for less than 2 weeks or with a lower lithium dose (total, 234 patients) resulted in even higher estimates. Lithium augmentation seems to be the treatment strategy in refractory depression that has been investigated most frequently in placebo-controlled, double-blind studies. The authors conclude from this meta-analysis that with respect to efficacy, lithium augmentation is the first-choice treatment procedure for depressed patients who fail to respond to antidepressant monotherapy.","A meta-analysis concluded that a lithium dose sufficient to produce serum levels of at least 0.5 mEq/L and a minimum treatment duration of 2 weeks resulted in a pooled OR of response to lithium augmentation compared with placebo of 3.31 (95% CI, 1.46-7.53). Lithium augmentation is a reasonable alternative for depressed patients who don't respond to conventional antidepressants."
"Which diuretics are safe and effective for patients with a sulfa allergy
To provide a critical and comprehensive review of the literature, specifically case reports and observational studies used to support the concept of cross-reactivity between sulfonylarylamines and non-sulfonylarylamines. A list of medications was formulated from several different review articles. A MEDLINE/PubMed search was conducted (1966-March 2004) using the individual medications and the MeSH terms of drug hypersensitivity/etiology, sulfonamides/adverse effects, and/or cross-reaction. A critical review of the methodology and conclusions for each article found in the search was conducted. The manufacturer's package insert (MPI) for each drug was examined for a statement concerning possible cross-reactivity in patients with a sulfonamide allergy. If indicated, the manufacturers were contacted to obtain any clinical data supporting the statement. A total of 33 medications were identified. Seventeen (51.5%) of the MPIs contained statements of varying degrees concerning use in patients with a ""sulfonamide"" allergy; 21 case series, case reports, and other articles were found. After a thorough critique of the literature, it appears that the dogma of sulfonylarylamine cross-reactivity with non-sulfonylarylamines is not supported by the data. While many of the case reports on the surface support the concept of cross-reactivity, on closer examination the level of evidence in many of the cases does not conclusively support either a connection or an association between the observed cause and effect.","A literature review of Medline from 1966 to early 2004 revealed 21 case series, case reports, and ""other articles"" that evaluated the presence of cross-reactivity. When the authors of this literature reviewed drilled down to diuretics, they found 5 case reports for cross-reactivity to acetazolamide, 2 case reports for furosemide, 1 case series, and 2 case reports for indapamide (a thiazide diuretic). After reviewing the studies, the authors concluded that little evidence suggested a problem with cross-reactivity either with acetazolamide or furosemide and that there may be an association of cross-reactivity between sulfonamide antibiotics and indapamide. This study was limited by its small numbers and lack of explicit critical appraisal."
"Which diuretics are safe and effective for patients with a sulfa allergy
To determine whether acetazolamide or furosemide produce allergic cross-reactions in patients with self-reported ""sulfa allergy."" Retrospective case series. A retrospective review included patients with intracranial hypertension and a self-reported sulfa allergy treated with either acetazolamide or furosemide seen at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics from 1972 to 2003. All presumed medication-related side effects were collected, including both predictable adverse effects (for example, paresthesias, fatigue) and unpredictable adverse reactions (for example, cutaneous fixed eruptions, urticaria, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, angioedema, anaphylaxis). We reviewed 363 charts. Of these, 329 patients (91%) were excluded. Of the remaining 34 cases that did report a so-called sulfa allergy, 13 (38%) received acetazolamide alone, 7 (21%) received furosemide alone, and 14 (41%) received both acetazolamide and furosemide. Of the 27 patients who received acetazolamide, 10 (37%) had no documented allergic cross-reaction to sulfa, and 2 (7%) cases had urticaria. The remaining 15 (56%) of acetazolamide-treated patients experienced predictable adverse reactions for this drug (for example, paresthesias). No patient experienced a severe allergic cross-reaction to sulfa. Of 21 patients who received furosemide, no unpredictable adverse reactions or allergic cross-reactions to sulfa were noted. We find little clinical or pharmacological evidence to suggest that a self-reported sulfa allergy is likely to produce a life-threatening cross-reaction with acetazolamide or furosemide. These medications should be considered for intracranial hypertension if the risk-to-benefit ratio warrants their use.","Researchers involved in a retrospective study of 363 hospital charts examined 34 patients with a self-reported history of sulfa allergy who were subsequently given acetazolamide (a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor), furosemide (a loop diuretic), or both. The nature of the self-reported sulfa allergic reaction was documented in 79% of the 34 patients. These reported reactions included urticarial rash, nonspecified rash, dyspnea, swelling, nausea or vomiting, throat swelling, red eyes, and bullae. Two patients who were given acetazolamide developed urticaria. No allergic reactions occurred for those patients given furosemide. The researchers concluded that there was little clinical or pharmacological evidence to suggest that a self-reported sulfa allergy was likely to produce a life-threatening cross-reaction with acetazolamide or furosemide. Small numbers and the lack of a standard definition for an allergic reaction limited the strength of their conclusion."
"What's the best diagnostic evaluation of night sweats
Night sweats are a common outpatient complaint, yet literature on the subject is scarce. Tuberculosis and lymphoma are diseases in which night sweats are a dominant symptom, but these are infrequently found to be the cause of night sweats in modern practice. While these diseases remain important diagnostic considerations in patients with night sweats, other diagnoses to consider include human immunodeficiency virus, gastroesophageal reflux disease, obstructive sleep apnea, hyperthyroidism, hypoglycemia, and several less common diseases. Antihypertensives, antipyretics, other medications, and drugs of abuse such as alcohol and heroin may cause night sweats. Serious causes of night sweats can be excluded with a thorough history, physical examination, and directed laboratory and radiographic studies. If a history and physical do not reveal a possible diagnosis, physicians should consider a purified protein derivative, complete blood count, human immunodeficiency virus test, thyroid-stimulating hormone test, erythrocyte sedimentation rate evaluation, chest radiograph, and possibly chest and abdominal computed tomographic scans and bone marrow biopsy.","One reasonable algorithm recommends an initial work-up including a complete blood count, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) level, a purified protein derivative (PPD) and HIV test, and a chest x-ray. If the results are unrevealing, a trial of antireflux medication is recommended. If the patient does not improve, consider a diary of nocturnal temperatures to help discern the presence or absence of febrile pulses and further evaluate for suspected endocarditis or lymphoma."
"What's the best diagnostic evaluation of night sweats
Clinical experience suggests that reflexology may have beneficial effects on the symptoms occurring in menopausal women, particularly psychological symptoms. This study aims to examine that effect rigorously. Randomised controlled trial with two parallel arms. School of Complementary Health in Exeter, Devon, UK. Seventy-six women, aged between 45 and 60 years, reporting menopausal symptoms. Women were randomised to receive nine sessions of either reflexology or nonspecific foot massage (control) by four qualified reflexologists given over a period of 19 weeks. The Women's Health Questionnaire (WHQ), the primary measures being the subscores for anxiety and depression. Severity (visual analogue scale, VAS) and frequency of flushes and night sweats. Mean (SD) scores for anxiety fell from 0.43 (0.29) to 0.22 (0.25) in the reflexology group and from 0.37 (0.27) to 0.27 (0.29) in the control group over the course of treatment. Mean (SD) scores for depression fell from 0.37 (0.25) to 0.20 (0.24) in the reflexology group and from 0.36 (0.23) to 0.20 (0.21) in the control (foot massage) group over the same period. For both scores there was strong evidence of a time effect (P < 0.001) but no evidence of a time-group interaction (P > 0.2). Similar changes were found for severity of hot flushes and night sweats. In the control group, 14/37 believed they had not received true reflexology. Foot reflexology was not shown to be more effective than non-specific foot massage in the treatment of psychological symptoms occurring during the menopause.",Neither primrose oil nor foot reflexology proved effective.
"What is the best way to evaluate and manage diarrhea in the febrile infant
Childhood diarrhea accounts for substantial morbidity and mortality worldwide. Multiple studies in children have shown that Lactobacillus, administered orally, may have antidiarrheal properties. We conducted a meta-analysis of randomized, controlled studies to assess whether treatment with Lactobacillus improves clinical outcomes in children with acute infectious diarrhea. Studies were sought in bibliographic databases of traditional biomedical as well as complementary and alternative medicine literature published from 1966 to 2000. Search terms were ""competitive inhibition,"" ""diarrhea,"" ""gastroenteritis,"" ""Lactobacillus,"" ""probiotic,"" ""rotavirus,"" and ""yog(h)urt."" We included studies that were adequately randomized, blinded, controlled trials in which the treatment group received Lactobacillus and the control group received an adequate placebo and that reported clinical outcome measures of diarrhea intensity. These inclusion criteria were applied by blind review and consensus. The original search yielded 26 studies, 9 of which met the criteria. Multiple observers independently extracted study characteristics and clinical outcomes. Data sufficient to perform meta-analysis of the effect of Lactobacillus on diarrhea duration and diarrhea frequency on day 2 were contained in 7 and 3 of the included studies, respectively. Summary point estimates indicate a reduction in diarrhea duration of 0.7 days (95% confidence interval: 0.3-1.2 days) and a reduction in diarrhea frequency of 1.6 stools on day 2 of treatment (95% confidence interval: 0.7-2.6 fewer stools) in the participants who received Lactobacillus compared with those who received placebo. Details of treatment protocols varied among the studies. A preplanned subanalysis suggests a dose-effect relationship. The results of this meta-analysis suggest that Lactobacillus is safe and effective as a treatment for children with acute infectious diarrhea.",An RCT showed that Lactobacillus supplementation shortened the duration of diarrhea for infants and young children.
"How useful is ultrasound to evaluate patients with postmenopausal bleeding
A panel of 14 physicians practicing medicine in the United States with expertise in radiology, obstetrics and gynecology, gynecologic oncology, hysteroscopy, epidemiology, and pathology was convened by the Society of Radiologists in Ultrasound to discuss the role of sonography in women with postmenopausal bleeding. Broad objectives of this conference were (1) to advance understanding of the utility of different diagnostic techniques for evaluating the endometrium in women with postmenopausal bleeding; (2) to formulate useful and practical guidelines for evaluation of women with postmenopausal bleeding, specifically as it relates to the use of sonography; and (3) to offer suggestions for future research projects. October 24 and 25, 2000, Washington, DC, preceding the annual Society of Radiologists in Ultrasound Advances in Sonography conference. Specific questions to the panel included the following: (1) What are the relative effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of using transvaginal sonography versus office (nondirected) endometrial biopsy as the initial examination for a woman with postmenopausal bleeding? (2) What are the sonographic standards for evaluating a woman with postmenopausal bleeding? (3) What are the abnormal sonographic findings in a woman with postmenopausal bleeding? (4) When should saline infusion sonohysterography or hysteroscopy be used in the evaluation of postmenopausal bleeding? (5) Should the diagnostic approach be modified for patients taking hormone replacement medications, tamoxifen, or other selective estrogen receptor modulators? Consensus recommendations were used to create an algorithm for evaluating women with postmenopausal bleeding. All panelists agreed that because postmenopausal bleeding is the most common presenting symptom of endometrial cancer, when postmenopausal bleeding occurs, clinical evaluation is indicated. The panelists also agreed that either transvaginal sonography or endometrial biopsy could be used safely and effectively as the first diagnostic step. Whether sonography or endometrial biopsy is used initially depends on the physician's assessment of patient risk, the nature of the physician's practice, the availability of high-quality sonography, and patient preference. Similar sensitivities for detecting endometrial carcinoma are reported for transvaginal sonography when an endometrial thickness of greater than 5 mm is considered abnormal and for endometrial biopsy when ""sufficient"" tissue is obtained. Currently, with respect to mortality, morbidity, and quality-of-life end points, there are insufficient data to comment as to which approach is more effective. The conference concluded by identifying several important unanswered questions and suggestions that could be addressed by future research projects.","A Consensus Conference Statement from the Society of Radiologists in Ultrasound recommended that either TVUS or endometrial biopsy could be used in the initial evaluation of patients with postmenopausal bleeding. Using a threshold of >5 mm as abnormal, they concluded that the sensitivities of TVUS and endometrial biopsy are comparable when ""sufficient tissue"" is obtained with endometrial biopsy. They felt that data was currently insufficient to clearly state which technique is more effective."
"Does surgery for carpal tunnel syndrome improve outcomes
A prospective, community-based, observational study of the outcome of surgical and nonoperative management was conducted. The study included 429 patients with carpal tunnel syndrome recruited in physicians' offices throughout Maine. Patients were assessed at baseline and at 6, 18, and 30 months following presentation using validated scales that measured symptom severity, functional status, and satisfaction. Seventy-seven percent of eligible survivors from the original cohort were monitored for 30 months. Surgically treated patients demonstrated improvements of 1.2 to 1.6 points on the 5-point Symptom Severity and Functional Status scales (23% to 45% improvement in scores), which persisted over the 30-month follow-up period. The nonoperatively managed patients showed little change in clinical status at 6, 18, and 30 months. While workers' compensation recipients had worse outcomes than nonrecipients, 36 of 68 (53%) workers' compensation recipients were completely or very satisfied with the results of the procedure 30 months after surgery. There were no significant differences in outcome between patients treated with endoscopic versus open carpal tunnel release. Among worker's compensation recipients, 12 of 68 (18%) surgical patients and 4 of 32 (13%) nonoperatively treated patients remained out of work because of carpal tunnel syndrome at 30 months. Thus, carpal tunnel surgery offered excellent symptom relief and functional improvement in this prospective community-based sample, irrespective of the surgical approach, even in workers' compensation recipients. Work absence remained high in both surgically and nonoperatively managed workers' compensation recipients.","One cohort study of 429 patients found that surgery (open or closed endoscopic) was more effective with respect to symptom relief and functional status than various nonsurgical therapies (NSAIDs, splints, physical or occupational therapy, local steroid injections, work modification, or vitamin B6) at 30 months follow-up. In this study the patients' pretreatment symptom and functioning scores were worse in the surgery group than in the nonsurgical group. The authors controlled for functional status scores, but not for symptom severity."
"Can we prevent splenic rupture for patients with infectious mononucleosis
The present study aims at an assessment of hepato-splenomegaly in infectious mononucleosis (IM). In 29 patients admitted to the ENT department with IM, based on the typical clinical and laboratory findings, including a positive mononucleosis test in most cases, the size of the liver and spleen was estimated by ultrasonic scanning on days 1, 3, 5, 10, 20, 30, 90 and 120 after admission. A control group of eight patients with peritonsillar abscess was included for comparison. The results showed that all patients had an enlarged spleen (mean enlargement: 50-60 per cent) but only a few were palpable. Half of the patients had enlargement of the liver (5-20 per cent), which was palpable in only 8 per cent. There was no correlation between the size of the spleen and that of the liver, not between the changes in the size of these organs. There was no enlargement of the liver or spleen in the control group. No correlation was found between the size, or changes in the size, of the organs and blood values such as lactatdehydrogenase and aspartatamino-transferase. There is, however, a striking parallelism between the curves for these parameters, which might indicate that the organs as well as the blood tests return to normal within 28 days. If this holds true, our warning to abstain from physical exercise and alcoholic intake may be limited to a period of about 1 month.","In a case-control study, 29 patients were admitted to an ear, nose, and throat department with infectious mononucleosis and were evaluated serially for splenic and hepatic enlargement by ultrasound. Diagnosis was based on clinical picture, a positive heterophile test, and other blood tests. Four patients were included despite negative serology due to compelling clinical presentations and symptoms. Serial ultrasound imaging showed that all had enlarged spleens (mean enlargement 50%-60%); 50% had hepatic enlargement (5%-20% enlargement). The patients were compared with a control group of 8 patients admitted with peritonsillar abscess, as verified by tonsillectomy. No controls had hepatic or splenic enlargement. Physical examinations detected splenomegaly in only 17% of the study patients. The exams were conducted by house staff without blinding, randomization, or tests of reproducibility. Ultrasound scanning was completed on days 1, 3, 5, 10, 20, 90, and 120. The spleen was significantly larger in the infectious mononucleosis group than in the control group for the first 30 days, and no difference in size was found over the subsequent 3 months. No correlation existed between laboratory values and enlargement of the spleen or liver."
"Can we prevent splenic rupture for patients with infectious mononucleosis
Infectious mononucleosis should be suspected in patients 10 to 30 years of age who present with sore throat and significant fatigue, palatal petechiae, posterior cervical or auricular adenopathy, marked adenopathy, or inguinal adenopathy. An atypical lymphocytosis of at least 20 percent or atypical lymphocytosis of at least 10 percent plus lymphocytosis of at least 50 percent strongly supports the diagnosis, as does a positive heterophile antibody test. False-negative results of heterophile antibody tests are relatively common early in the course of infection. Patients with negative results may have another infection, such as toxoplasmosis, streptococcal infection, cytomegalovirus infection, or another viral infection. Symptomatic treatment, the mainstay of care, includes adequate hydration, analgesics, antipyretics, and adequate rest. Bed rest should not be enforced, and the patient's energy level should guide activity. Corticosteroids, acyclovir, and antihistamines are not recommended for routine treatment of infectious mononucleosis, although corticosteroids may benefit patients with respiratory compromise or severe pharyngeal edema. Patients with infectious mononucleosis should be withdrawn from contact or collision sports for at least four weeks after the onset of symptoms. Fatigue, myalgias, and need for sleep may persist for several months after the acute infection has resolved.","No quality studies evaluate the risks of physical activity in infectious mononucleosis. Case reports of rupture have found comparable rates between traumatic and nontraumatic causes. In addition, no clinical trials evaluate imaging in decisions regarding return to activity and its effect on splenic rupture. Ultrasound is often used in the athletic setting for these decisions but no evidence supports its use as routine practice. The routine use of ultrasound for this purpose would cost more than $1 million to prevent 1 traumatic rupture."
"What is the evaluation and treatment strategy for Raynaud's phenomenon
To determine the effects and toxicity of prazosin versus placebo proposed for the treatment of Raynaud's phenomenon (RP) in scleroderma. We searched the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, and Medline up to December 1996 using the Cochrane Collaboration search strategy developed by Dickersin et al.(1994). Key words included: Raynaud's or vasospasm, scleroderma or progressive systemic sclerosis or connective tissue disease or autoimmune disease. Current Contents were searched up to and including April 7, 1997. All bibliographies of articles retrieved were searched and key experts in the area were contacted for additional and unpublished data. The initial search strategy included all languages. Randomized controlled trials comparing prazosin versus placebo were eligible if they reported clinical outcomes from the start of therapy. Trials with a greater than 35% dropout were excluded. Trials were included if patients with diffuse or limited scleroderma were the subjects. If patients with other connective tissue diseases or primary Raynaud's were included, the trial was used if the data on the scleroderma patients could be extracted from the paper. All data were abstracted by two independent and trained reviewers (DF, AT), and verified by a third reviewer (JP). Each trial was assessed independently by the same two reviewers for its quality using a validated quality assessment tool (Jadad 1996). Peto's odds ratios were calculated for all dichotomous outcomes and a weighted mean difference was carried out on all continuous outcomes. Fixed effects and random effects model were used if the data was homogeneous or heterogeneous, respectively. Two trials with a total of 40 patients were included. Prazosin has been found in two randomized controlled cross-over trials to be more effective than placebo in the treatment of Raynaud's secondary to scleroderma. However, the positive response is modest and side effects are not rare in those taking prazosin. Prazosin is modestly effective in the treatment of Raynaud's phenomenon secondary to scleroderma.","A systematic review of 2 randomized controlled trials with a total of 40 patients found prazosin modestly effective in secondary Raynaud's phenomenon, but it was less well-tolerated than calcium channel blockers."
"What is the evaluation and treatment strategy for Raynaud's phenomenon
Most patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc) have Raynaud's phenomenon (RP), which is often more severe than idiopathic RP. This study was a meta-analysis to determine the efficacy of calcium-channel blockers for the treatment of RP in SSc. The primary outcome measures were frequency and severity of ischemic attacks, digital skin temperature, patient and physician global assessments, and digital ulcers. The Cochrane search strategy was used to ascertain all trials in all languages. Primary data sources included Medline, Current Contents, and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register. Studies that met the inclusion criteria were randomized controlled trials of >2 days' duration with a dropout rate of <35%. Twenty-nine studies were found, of which 8 randomized controlled trials were eligible for inclusion. The total number of patients included was small (n = 109). Most trials included primary and secondary RP, and the main reasons for trial exclusion were inability to extract subset data on SSc patients (18 trials), data published previously (2 trials), and lack of a control group (1 trial). Data were abstracted independently by 2 reviewers, and either a weighted mean difference (WMD) or a standardized mean difference (SMD) was calculated for all continuous outcomes; however, information was not available for all outcomes within trials. The WMD of all calcium-channel blockers versus placebo (6 trials) and of nifedipine alone versus placebo (5 trials) for the reduction in the frequency of ischemic attacks over a 2-week period was -8.31 (95% confidence interval [95% CI] -15.71, -0.91) and -10.21 (95% CI -20.09, -0.34), respectively. The SMD of all calcium-channel blockers versus placebo (3 trials) and of nifedipine alone versus placebo (2 trials) for the reduction in the severity of ischemic attacks was -0.69 (95% CI -1.21, -0.17) and -0.99 (95% CI -1.74, -0.24), respectively. Calcium-channel blockers for RP in SSc have been tested in several small clinical trials and appear to lead to significant clinical improvement in both the frequency and the severity of ischemic attacks. Most trials were crossover trials in which order effect was not studied. This could have introduced bias. The results of this study suggest that the efficacy of calcium-channel blockers in reducing the severity and frequency of ischemic attacks in RP secondary to SSc is moderate at best (mean reduction of 8.3 attacks in 2 weeks and 35% less severity), and a further large, randomized controlled trial needs to be conducted.",A meta-analysis of 6 randomized crossover studies compared nifedipine or nicardipine with placebo in 59 patients with secondary Raynaud's phenomenon and underlying systemic sclerosis. Nifedipine significantly decreased the frequency and severity of attacks. Nicardipine showed a trend towards reduced symptoms in 1 trial with only 15 patients.
"What is the best way to treat patients with white-coat hypertension
To determine the prognostic significance of ambulatory blood pressure, we prospectively followed for up to 7.5 years (mean, 3.2) 1187 subjects with essential hypertension and 205 healthy normotensive control subjects who had baseline off-therapy 24-hour noninvasive ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. Prevalence of white coat hypertension, defined by an average daytime ambulatory blood pressure lower than 131/86 mm Hg in women and 136/87 mm Hg in men in clinically hypertensive subjects, was 19.2%. Cardiovascular morbidity, expressed as the number of combined fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events per 100 patient-years, was 0.47 in the normotensive group, 0.49 in the white coat hypertension group, 1.79 in dippers with ambulatory hypertension, and 4.99 in nondippers with ambulatory hypertension. After adjustment for traditional risk markers for cardiovascular disease, morbidity did not differ between the normotensive and white coat hypertension groups (P = .83). Compared with the white coat hypertension group, cardiovascular morbidity increased in ambulatory hypertension in dippers (relative risk, 3.70; 95% confidence interval, 1.13 to 12.5), with a further increase of morbidity in nondippers (relative risk, 6.26; 95% confidence interval, 1.92 to 20.32). After adjustment for age, sex, diabetes, and echocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy (relative risk versus subjects with normal left ventricular mass, 1.82; 95% confidence interval, 1.02 to 3.22), cardiovascular morbidity in ambulatory hypertension was higher (P = .0002) in nondippers than in dippers in women (relative risk, 6.79; 95% confidence interval, 2.45 to 18.82) but not in men (P = .91). Our findings suggest that ambulatory blood pressures stratifies cardiovascular risk in essential hypertension independent of clinic blood pressure and other traditional risk markers including echocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","A prospective cohort study compared fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular event rates among patients who had white-coat hypertension, sustained hypertension, or were normotensive. Investigators performed 24-hour ABPM on 1187 patients who had clinic blood pressures over 140/90 on three visits. They found that 228 patients had white-coat hypertension, defined as mean ambulatory blood pressures below the 90th percentile of a normotensive population, and 959 patients had sustained hypertension. They followed these patients, along with 205 normotensive controls, for a mean of 3.2 years. Cardiovascular event rates did not differ significantly between normotensive and white-coat hypertension patients (P=.83), but the difference in event-free survival between the sustained hypertension group and both the white-coat hypertension and normotensive groups was highly significant (P=.002)."
"What steps can reduce morbidity and mortality caused by hip fractures
To estimate the number of deaths and readmissions associated with delay in operation after femoral fracture. Analysis of inpatient hospital episode statistics. NHS hospital trusts in England with at least 100 admissions for fractured neck of femur during the study period. Patients People aged > or = 65 admitted from home with fractured neck of femur and discharged between April 2001 and March 2004. In hospital mortality and emergency readmission within 28 days. There were 129,522 admissions for fractured neck of femur in 151 trusts with 18,508 deaths in hospital (14.3%). Delay in operation was associated with an increased risk of death in hospital, which was reduced but persisted after adjustment for comorbidity. For all deaths in hospital, the odds ratio for more than one day's delay relative to one day or less was 1.27 (95% confidence interval 1.23 to 1.32) after adjustment for comorbidity. The proportion with more than two days' delay ranged from 1.1% to 62.4% between trusts. If death rates in patients with at most one day's delay had been repeated throughout all 151 trusts in this study, there would have been an average of 581 (478 to 683) fewer total deaths per year (9.4% of the total). There was little evidence of an association between delay and emergency readmission. Delay in operation is associated with an increased risk of death but not readmission after a fractured neck of femur, even with adjustment for comorbidity, and there is wide variation between trusts.","A 2006 observational study found that delay in operating was associated with an increased risk of death in the hospital, even after adjusting for comorbidities. For all deaths in the hospital, the odds ratio [OR] for delaying more than 1 day, relative to 1 day or less, was 1.27 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.23-1.32)"
"What steps can reduce morbidity and mortality caused by hip fractures
Until operative treatment involving the use of various implants was introduced in the 1950s, hip fractures were managed using conservative methods based on traction and bed rest. To compare conservative with operative treatment for fractures of the proximal femur (hip) in adults. We searched the Cochrane Musculoskeletal Injuries Group trials register and bibliographies of published papers, and contacted trialists. Date of the most recent search: August 1999. Randomised and quasi-randomised trials comparing these two treatment methods in adults with hip fracture. Outcomes sought fell into four categories: a) fracture fixation complications, b) post-operative or clinical complications, c) anatomical restoration and d) final outcome measures including mortality. Two reviewers independently assessed trial quality, by use of an twelve item scale, and extracted data. Additional information was sought from trialists. After grouping by fracture type, comparable groups of trials were subgrouped by implant type and where appropriate, data were pooled using the fixed effects model. The five randomised trials identified involved only 425 elderly patients. One small and potentially biased trial of 23 patients with undisplaced intracapsular fracture showed a reduced risk of non-union for those fractures treated operatively. The four identified studies on extracapsular fractures tested a variety of surgical techniques and implant devices and only one trial involving 106 patients can be considered to test current practice. In this trial, no differences were found in medical complications, mortality and long-term pain. However, operative treatment was more likely to result in the fracture healing without leg shortening, a shorter hospital stay and a statistically non-significant increase in the return of patients back to their original residence. Given the lack of available evidence to inform practice and the continued variation in practice, good quality randomised trials of operative versus conservative treatment for undisplaced intracapsular fractures are warranted. The limited available evidence from randomised trials does not suggest major differences in outcome between conservative and operative management programmes for extracapsular femoral fractures, but operative treatment appears to be associated with a reduced length of hospital stay and improved rehabilitation. However these results are derived mainly from one study. Conservative treatment will be acceptable where modern surgical facilities are unavailable, and will result in a reduction in complications associated with surgery, but rehabilitation is likely to be slower and limb deformity more common. Although further randomised trials would provide more robust data, they may be difficult to mount.",A meta-analysis found few randomized trials comparing operative with nonoperative therapy; it concluded that surgical treatment seems to be associated with a reduced length of hospital stay and improved rehabilitation.
"What steps can reduce morbidity and mortality caused by hip fractures
Hip fracture patients have a high risk of thrombo-embolic complications following surgical management. To examine the effects of heparin (unfractionated (U), and low molecular weight (LMW) heparins), and physical methods (compression stockings, calf or foot pumps) for prevention of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism after surgery for hip fracture in the elderly. We searched the Cochrane Musculoskeletal Injuries Group specialised register (up to March 2002), MEDLINE (1966 to March 2002), EMBASE (1980 to March 2002), CINAHL (1982 to February week 4 2002), Current Contents (1993 week 26 to 2002 week 12), reference lists of published articles and contacted trialists and other workers in the field. Date of most recent search: March 2002. Randomised and quasi-randomised trials evaluating the use of heparins and physical agents for prevention of DVT and pulmonary embolism in patients undergoing surgery for hip fracture. Two reviewers independently assessed methodological quality and extracted data. Trials were grouped into five categories (heparin versus control, mechanical versus control, LMW heparin versus U heparin, heparin versus mechanical, and miscellaneous) and results pooled where possible. The 31 included trials involved at least 2958 predominantly female and elderly patients. Overall, trial quality was disappointing. Ten trials involving 826 patients which compared U heparin with control, and five trials of 373 patients which compared LMW heparin with control, showed a reduction in the incidence of lower limb DVT (124/474 (26%) versus 219/519 (42%); relative risk (RR) 0.60; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.50 to 0.71). There were insufficient data to confirm the efficacy of either agent in the prevention of pulmonary embolism. There was no statistically significant difference in overall mortality (42/356 (12%) versus 38/374 (10%); RR 1.16; 95%CI 0.77 to 1.74). Data were inadequate for all other outcomes including wound complications. There is insufficient evidence from five trials, involving 644 patients, to establish if LMW heparin was superior to U heparin. Most trials evaluating heparins had methodological defects. Five trials, involving 487 patients, testing mechanical pumping devices were also methodologically flawed, and so pooled results need to be viewed cautiously. Mechanical pumping devices may protect against DVT (16/221 (7%) versus 52/229 (22%); RR 0.31; 95%CI 0.19 to 0.51) and pulmonary embolism. Data were insufficient to establish any effect on the incidence of fatal pulmonary embolism and overall mortality. Problems with skin abrasion and compliance were reported. U and LMW heparins protect against lower limb DVT. There is insufficient evidence to confirm either protection against pulmonary embolism or an overall benefit, or to distinguish between various applications of heparin. Foot and calf pumping devices appear to prevent DVT, may protect against pulmonary embolism, and reduce mortality, but compliance remains a problem. Good quality trials of mechanical methods as well as direct comparisons with heparin and low dose aspirin should be considered.","The effectiveness of unfractionated and low-molecular-weight heparin was evaluated in a 2002 Cochrane systematic review. While evidence was insufficient to recommend 1 agent over another, both were found to significantly decrease the incidence of lower-extremity DVT over placebo (for unfractionated heparin, relative risk [RR]=0.59 [95% CI, 0.49-0.72]; for low-molecular-weight heparin, RR=0.60 [95% CI, 0.50-0.71]). Number needed to treat [NNT] with either agent was 7."
"What steps can reduce morbidity and mortality caused by hip fractures
Surgical site infection and other hospital-acquired infections cause significant morbidity after internal fixation of fractures. The administration of antibiotics may reduce the frequency of infections. To determine whether the prophylactic administration of antibiotics in people undergoing surgical management of hip or other closed long bone fractures reduces the incidence of surgical site and other hospital-acquired infections. We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (December 2009), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2009, Issue 4), MEDLINE (1950 to November 2009), EMBASE (1988 to December 2009), other electronic databases including the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (December 2009), conferences proceedings and reference lists of articles. Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing any regimen of systemic antibiotic prophylaxis administered at the time of surgery, compared with no prophylaxis, placebo, or a regimen of different duration, in people with a hip fracture undergoing surgery for internal fixation or prosthetic replacement, or with any closed long bone fracture undergoing internal fixation. All trials needed to report surgical site infection. Two authors independently screened papers for inclusion, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. Pooled data are presented graphically. Data from 8447 participants in 23 studies were included in the analyses. In people undergoing surgery for closed fracture fixation, single dose antibiotic prophylaxis significantly reduced deep surgical site infection (risk ratio 0.40, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.67), superficial surgical site infections, urinary infections, and respiratory tract infections. Multiple dose prophylaxis had an effect of similar size on deep surgical site infection (risk ratio 0.35, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.62), but significant effects on urinary and respiratory infections were not confirmed. Although the risk of bias in many studies as reported was unclear, sensitivity analysis showed that removal from the meta-analyses of studies at high risk of bias did not alter the conclusions. Economic modelling using data from one large trial indicated that single dose prophylaxis with ceftriaxone is a cost-effective intervention. Data for the incidence of adverse effects were very limited, but as expected they appeared to be more common in those receiving antibiotics, compared with placebo or no prophylaxis. Antibiotic prophylaxis should be offered to those undergoing surgery for closed fracture fixation.","Antibiotic prophylaxis has been supported by a Cochrane review, which concluded that single-dose antibiotic prophylaxis before surgery significantly reduced the risk of deep wound infections (RR=0.40; 95% CI, 0.24-0.67; NNT=55), as well as superficial wound, urinary, and respiratory tract infections."
"How can you best diagnose idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus
Gait instability, urinary incontinence, and dementia are the signs and symptoms typically found in patients who have normal pressure hydrocephalus. Estimated to cause no more than 5 percent of cases of dementia, normal pressure hydrocephalus often is treatable, and accurate recognition of the clinical triad coupled with radiographic evidence most commonly identifies likely responders. Magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography typically demonstrates ventricular dilation with preservation of the surrounding brain tissue. The abnormality in normal pressure hydrocephalus occurs secondary to an abnormality in fluid removal, leading to an increase in ventricular size and encroachment of enlarged ventricles on adjacent brain tissue. The pressure exerted on the cerebral parenchyma by immense fluid-filled cavities deforms white matter tracts, instigating gait abnormalities and incomplete control of the bladder, as well as difficulties in processing incoming stimulation and in producing expeditious responses. Signs and symptoms often occur as sequelae to an imbalance between the expected ongoing production of cerebrospinal fluid and continuous efflux. Ventriculoperitoneal shunting is used to relieve excess ventricular fluid not absorbed by normal physiologic channels. Multiple studies have explored various techniques to identify patients with normal pressure hydrocephalus in an effort to predict likely benefit from shunting. However, the effectiveness of cerebrospinal fluid diversion has never been proven in a randomized controlled trial comparing use of a shunt versus no shunt.","A systematic review of the most commonly used prognostic tests identified a response to a large-volume (40-50 mL) CSF tap test as having a positive predictive value (PPV) between 73% and 100% but a negative predictive value (NPV) of only 23% to 42%. Thus, observing an improvement of function after such a test is a good predictor of improvement after shunting, but many patients who do not respond to the test respond to shunting. A variation of the CSF tap test is the extended lumbar drainage test, which involves placing a lumbar intrathecal catheter and allowing the drainage of 10 mL of CSF/hour for 72 hours. The PPV for this test ranges from 80% to 100%, and NPV from 66% to 100%. A third possible test is the measurement of resistance to an infusion of saline into the lumbar subarachnoid space (CSF Ro test). This test has multiple variations of technique. Reported values for PPV are 75% to 92%, and for NPV of 27% to 92%. Other tests, such as radionuclide cisternography or magnetic resonance imaging CSF flow void, have predictive values too low or have too few studies to be recommended."
"Are DMARDs effective for rheumatologic diseases besides rheumatoid arthritis
The signs and symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis (AS) respond inadequately to nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, corticosteroids, and disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs in quite a number of patients. Tumor necrosis factor inhibitors have demonstrated success in reducing AS disease activity in a limited number of clinical trials. The objective of this multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of infliximab in patients with AS. Patients were randomly assigned to receive infusions of placebo or 5 mg/kg infliximab at weeks 0, 2, 6, 12, and 18. Efficacy was assessed using the ASsessment in Ankylosing Spondylitis (ASAS) International Working Group criteria, the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI), night pain, patient's global assessment, the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI), the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Metrology Index (BASMI), chest expansion, the Mander enthesis index, the total swollen joint index, the C-reactive protein level, and the Short Form 36 (SF-36) health survey questionnaire. The primary end point in this study was the proportion of patients with a 20% improvement response according to the ASAS International Working Group criteria (ASAS20 responders) at week 24. Of the 357 patients screened, 201 were assigned to receive 5 mg/kg infliximab and 78 were assigned to receive placebo. After 24 weeks, 61.2% of patients in the infliximab group were ASAS20 responders compared with 19.2% of patients in the placebo group (P < 0.001). Clinical benefit was observed in patients receiving infliximab as early as week 2 and was maintained over the 24-week study period. Patients receiving infliximab also showed significant improvements in the BASDAI, BASFI, BASMI, chest expansion, and physical component summary score of the SF-36. Adverse events were reported by 82.2% of patients receiving infliximab and by 72.0% of patients receiving placebo; however, most adverse events in both treatment groups were mild or moderate in severity. Infliximab was well tolerated and effective in a large cohort of patients with AS during a 24-week study period.",One study of infliximab vs placebo showed 61.2% vs 19.2% patients with good clinical benefit at 24 weeks and only mild or moderate adverse events (P<.001; NNT=2.38).
"Are DMARDs effective for rheumatologic diseases besides rheumatoid arthritis
Standard therapy for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated systemic vasculitis (AASV) with cyclophosphamide (CYC) and prednisolone is limited by toxicity. This unblinded, prospective, randomized, controlled trial was undertaken to determine whether methotrexate (MTX) could replace CYC in the early treatment of AASV. Patients with newly diagnosed AASV, with serum creatinine levels <150 mumoles/liter, and without critical organ manifestations of disease were randomized to receive either standard oral CYC, 2 mg/kg/day or oral MTX, 20-25 mg/week; both groups received the same prednisolone regimen. All drug treatments were gradually tapered and withdrawn by 12 months. Followup continued to 18 months. The primary end point was the remission rate at 6 months (noninferiority testing). One hundred patients were recruited from 26 European centers; 51 patients were randomized to the MTX group and 49 to the CYC group. At 6 months, the remission rate in patients treated with MTX (89.8%) was not inferior to that in patients treated with CYC (93.5%) (P = 0.041). In the MTX group, remission was delayed among patients with more extensive disease (P = 0.04) or pulmonary involvement (P = 0.03). Relapse rates at 18 months were 69.5% in the MTX group and 46.5% in the CYC group; the median time from remission to relapse was 13 months and 15 months, respectively (P = 0.023, log rank test). Two patients from each group died. Adverse events (mean 0.87 episodes/patient) included leukopenia, which was less frequent in the MTX versus the CYC group (P = 0.012), and liver dysfunction, which was more frequent in the MTX group (P = 0.036). MTX can replace CYC for initial treatment of early AASV. The MTX regimen used in the present study was less effective for induction of remission in patients with extensive disease and pulmonary involvement and was associated with more relapses than the CYC regimen after termination of treatment. The high relapse rates in both treatment arms support the practice of continuation of immunosuppressive treatment beyond 12 months.",A recent randomized controlled trial of 100 patients with antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated systemic vasculitis showed methotrexate may be able to replace cyclosporine for both induction of remission (methotrexate=89.8% vs cyclosporine=93.5%; P=.041) and maintenance of remission (69.5% vs 46.5% at 18 months; P=.023).
"What treatments are safe and effective for mild to moderate hypertension in pregnancy
Examine the benefits/risks of beta-blockers for pregnancy hypertension. Meta-analysis of relevant trials identified by comprehensive literature review (1966-97). Included were 30 trials for pregnancy hypertension, and four others for perinatal outcomes only. For mild chronic hypertension treated throughout pregnancy (n=2 trials), oral beta-blockers (compared with no therapy) were associated with an inconsistent increase in small for gestational age (SGA) infants (OR 2.46 [1.02, 5.92]). For mild-moderate 'late-onset' pregnancy hypertension (i.e. either chronic treated only late in pregnancy, or pregnancy-induced) (n=8 trials), oral beta-blockers (compared with no therapy) were associated with a decrease in severe hypertension (OR 0.27 [0.16, 0.451), borderline decrease in development of proteinuria (OR 0.69 [0.48, 1.02]), decrease in RDS (OR 0.33 [0.13, 0.85]), but a borderline increase in SGA infants (OR 1.47 [0.96, 2.26]). Beta-blockers were equivalent to other agents (n=15 trials). For severe 'late-onset' pregnancy hypertension (n=5 trials), i.v. labetalol produced less maternal hypotension (OR 0.13 [0.03, 0.71]) and fewer cesareans (OR 0.23 [0.13, 0.63]) than i.v. hydralazine/diazoxide. It is not clear that the benefits outweigh the risks when beta-blockers are used to treat mild to moderate chronic or pregnancy-induced hypertension, given the unknown overall effect on perinatal outcomes. For severe 'late-onset' pregnancy hypertension, i.v. labetalol is safer than i.v. hydralazine or diazoxide.","Meta-analyses of beta-blocker trials show a borderline increase in SGA infants, with no related increase in perinatal mortality, as well as a decrease in the incidence of respiratory distress syndrome."
"How does VTE risk for the patch and vaginal ring compare with oral contraceptives
This open-label, randomized study compared the pharmacokinetics of ethinylestradiol (EE) from the contraceptive vaginal ring NuvaRing (15 microg EE/day), the transdermal patch (20 microg EE/day) and a combined oral contraceptive (COC) containing 30 microg EE. After 2-8 weeks of synchronization by COC treatment, subjects were randomized to 21 days of treatment with NuvaRing, patch or COC. Analysis of area under the EE concentration-versus-time curve (AUC) during 21 days of treatment showed that exposure to EE in the NuvaRing group was 3.4 times lower than in the patch group (p < .05) and 2.1 times lower than in the pill group (p < .05). Serum EE levels of subjects showed much lower variation with NuvaRing than with the patch or the COC. Thus, exposure to EE was significantly lower with NuvaRing than with the patch and pill methods, demonstrating that NuvaRing is a low-estrogen-dose contraceptive method that also results in low estrogen exposure.",One pharmacokinetic study found that exposure to EE differed among delivery systems. The area under the EE concentration-vs-time curve in the patch group was 1.6 times higher than in the OC group (P<.05) and 3.4 times higher than in the vaginal ring group (P<.05).
"Do acetaminophen and an NSAID combined relieve osteoarthritis pain better than either alone
To compare the relative safety and efficacy of naproxen and acetaminophen in the treatment of osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee. The major outcome measures were radiographic progression and withdrawal from the trial due to lack of efficacy. One hundred seventy-eight patients with OA of the knee were enrolled in a 2-year prospective, controlled, double-blind multicenter trial and were randomly assigned to receive acetaminophen (ACT) or naproxen (NPX) treatment. After 6 weeks of treatment, modest improvement in pain on motion and in physician's global assessment was seen in both the ACT and the NPX groups, and the NPX group also had modest improvement in pain at rest and in 50-foot walk time. Sixty-two patients completed the 2-year study. Among these patients, radiographic progression was similar in the 2 treatment groups. Withdrawal from the trial due to lack of drug efficacy was slightly more frequent among patients in the ACT group (22% versus 16%), but withdrawal due to adverse drug effects was slightly more common in the NPX group (23% versus 18%). The efficacy of ACT treatment and NPX treatment was similar, although it was slightly better for NPX. The toxicity rate was slightly lower with ACT. However, the high rate of withdrawal in both treatment groups suggests that neither is satisfactory for the treatment of OA.","One randomized controlled trial comparing 750 mg/d naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn) with 2600 mg/d acetaminophen for 2 years found similar pain relief for both medications and a dropout rate of 65% in both groups. Similar numbers of persons taking acetaminophen or naproxen dropped out because of adverse effects (20%) or lack of efficacy (19%), and no difference was seen in functional improvement between the 2 groups."
"Do antibiotics prevent recurrent UTI in children with anatomic abnormalities
The aim, in conservative management of vesico-ureteric reflux by antimicrobial prophylaxis, is to prevent recurrent febrile urinary tract infections and consequent renal scarring. However, the effects of this prophylactic strategy are difficult to evaluate, since the required studies comparing children on prophylaxis with controls (without prophylaxis but under careful supervision) are lacking. Furthermore, the optimal length of prophylaxis needs to be defined. Since risk of renal scarring is believed to occur more frequently in young people, and since recurrent urinary infections mainly affect girls, the age and sex of subjects are important in the design of a prophylactic regimen. Nitrofurantoin and trimethoprim are the most common agents used for long-term, low-dose antibacterial prophylaxis. Break-through infections still result from non-compliance and from development of bacterial resistance, the latter mainly arising with trimethoprim. Few studies of prophylactic drugs are available that adequately define patient materials and include a random allocation to the different agents. Further studies of the effects of alternative prophylactic agents are called for, preferably combined with fresh insight into the ecological impact on the bowel and periurethral floras.","One study found that in children taking low-dose trimethoprim, 97% of the parents reported giving antibiotics on daily basis, but in 31% of subjects, trimethoprim was not detectable in the urine. Risk of prophylaxis includes nausea, vomiting, and rash in 8% to 10% of patients; development of resistant organisms; and change in indigenous microflora."
"Do antibiotics prevent recurrent UTI in children with anatomic abnormalities
Guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics recommend obtaining a voiding cystourethrogram and a renal ultrasonogram for young children after a first urinary tract infection; renal scanning with technetium-99m-labeled dimercaptosuccinic acid has also been endorsed by other authorities. We investigated whether imaging studies altered management or improved outcomes in young children with a first febrile urinary tract infection. In a prospective trial involving 309 children (1 to 24 months old), an ultrasonogram and an initial renal scan were obtained within 72 hours after diagnosis, contrast voiding cystourethrography was performed one month later, and renal scanning was repeated six months later. The ultrasonographic results were normal in 88 percent of the children (272 of 309); the identified abnormalities did not modify management. Acute pyelonephritis was diagnosed in 61 percent of the children (190 of 309). Thirty-nine percent of the children who underwent cystourethrography (117 of 302) had vesicoureteral reflux; 96 percent of these children (112 of 117) had grade I, II, or III vesicoureteral reflux. Repeated scans were obtained for 89 percent of the children (275 of 309); renal scarring was noted in 9.5 percent of these children (26 of 275). An ultrasonogram performed at the time of acute illness is of limited value. A voiding cystourethrogram for the identification of reflux is useful only if antimicrobial prophylaxis is effective in reducing reinfections and renal scarring. Renal scans obtained at presentation identify children with acute pyelonephritis, and scans obtained six months later identify those with renal scarring. The routine performance of urinalysis, urine culture, or both during subsequent febrile illnesses in all children with a previous febrile urinary tract infection will probably obviate the need to obtain either early or late scans.","There was a clinically, but not statistically, significant trend towards reduced risk of UTI during long-term antibiotic treatment (risk reduction [RR]=0.31; 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.10-1.00); however, no sustained benefit was seen once antibiotics were stopped (RR=0.79; 95% CI, 0.61-1.02). There were many problems with the methodological quality of these trials, including significant heterogeneity. The researchers concluded that well-designed randomized controlled trails are still needed to evaluate this commonly used intervention in the pediatric population."
"Should the varicella vaccine be given to all children to prevent chickenpox
The efficacy of a high-titer, reformulated varicella vaccine was studied in 513 10- to 30-month-old children. Vaccinees were randomly allocated to 5 groups to receive one of two lots of an original high-titer vaccine, one of two lots of a partially heat-inactivated vaccine, or placebo. Both vaccines were well tolerated. Seroconversion was detected in 100% and 99% of children immunized with the high- and low-titer vaccines, respectively. Sixty-five cases of serologically confirmed varicella-like disease were discovered during follow-up (mean, 29.3 months): 5 in the high-titer vaccine group, 19 in the low-titer vaccine group, and 41 in the placebo group (P < or = .005 for each difference). Thus, the protective efficacy of live attenuated varicella vaccine is dependent on vaccine titer. High-titer varicella vaccine induces excellent protection in healthy young children.",A trial showed efficacy of 72% over 29 months.

The unique contributions toward our understanding of varicella vaccine, including spread of vaccine-type virus, incidence of zoster, and immune correlates provided by studies of immunocompromised patients are discussed. The importance of protecting high-risk children against severe varicella by the use of varicella vaccine is apparent.","The FDA has not approved this live-virus vaccine for use in pregnant women and immunocom-promised persons, including transplant recipients and persons receiving corticosteroid therapy. However, the vaccine has been very well-studied in children with leukemia. A review of these studies found that optimal seroconversion requires 2 sequential vaccine doses (86% efficacy). A rash of varying severity was the predominant adverse event in 20% to 50% of vacinees."
"Should the varicella vaccine be given to all children to prevent chickenpox
To determine the safety and immunogenicity of varicella vaccine in children with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Children (n = 41) who were mildly affected by HIV (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stage N1 or A1) and had no history or serum antibody indicative of prior varicella infection were immunized with two doses of live attenuated varicella vaccine. A minority of the vaccine recipients had mild local or systemic reactions. Vaccination had no effect on the clinical stage of HIV or the HIV RNA plasma load. CD4 cell percentage and CD4 cell count were marginally decreased at week 4 after the first vaccination; this effect was no longer present at week 8 after vaccination. Two months after the second dose of vaccine, 60% of vaccine recipients had anti-varicella antibody in their serum, and 83% had a positive lymphocyte proliferation assay response to varicella antigen. On the basis of its safety and immunogenicity, varicella vaccine should be considered in the childhood vaccines given to mildly affected HIV-infected children.",Study of vaccine use in other immunocompromised children has been limited. Early results from a trial in HIV-infected children who were not severely immunocompromised suggests similar tolerance and efficacy compared with children without HIV.
"Are beta-2-agonists or anticholinergics more effective for treating COPD
A study was undertaken to record exacerbations and health resource use in patients with COPD during 6 months of treatment with tiotropium, salmeterol, or matching placebos. Patients with COPD were enrolled in two 6-month randomised, placebo controlled, double blind, double dummy studies of tiotropium 18 micro g once daily via HandiHaler or salmeterol 50 micro g twice daily via a metered dose inhaler. The two trials were combined for analysis of heath outcomes consisting of exacerbations, health resource use, dyspnoea (assessed by the transitional dyspnoea index, TDI), health related quality of life (assessed by St George's Respiratory Questionnaire, SGRQ), and spirometry. 1207 patients participated in the study (tiotropium 402, salmeterol 405, placebo 400). Compared with placebo, tiotropium but not salmeterol was associated with a significant delay in the time to onset of the first exacerbation. Fewer COPD exacerbations/patient year occurred in the tiotropium group (1.07) than in the placebo group (1.49, p<0.05); the salmeterol group (1.23 events/year) did not differ from placebo. The tiotropium group had 0.10 hospital admissions per patient year for COPD exacerbations compared with 0.17 for salmeterol and 0.15 for placebo (not statistically different). For all causes (respiratory and non-respiratory) tiotropium, but not salmeterol, was associated with fewer hospital admissions while both groups had fewer days in hospital than the placebo group. The number of days during which patients were unable to perform their usual daily activities was lowest in the tiotropium group (tiotropium 8.3 (0.8), salmeterol 11.1 (0.8), placebo 10.9 (0.8), p<0.05). SGRQ total score improved by 4.2 (0.7), 2.8 (0.7) and 1.5 (0.7) units during the 6 month trial for the tiotropium, salmeterol and placebo groups, respectively (p<0.01 tiotropium v placebo). Compared with placebo, TDI focal score improved in both the tiotropium group (1.1 (0.3) units, p<0.001) and the salmeterol group (0.7 (0.3) units, p<0.05). Evaluation of morning pre-dose FEV(1), peak FEV(1) and mean FEV(1) (0-3 hours) showed that tiotropium was superior to salmeterol while both active drugs were more effective than placebo. Exacerbations of COPD and health resource usage were positively affected by daily treatment with tiotropium. With the exception of the number of hospital days associated with all causes, salmeterol twice daily resulted in no significant changes compared with placebo. Tiotropium also improved health related quality of life, dyspnoea, and lung function in patients with COPD.","In a study in 2003, 1207 patients were randomized to receive the above doses of salmeterol, tiotropium, or placebo. Over the course of 6 months, tiotropium was associated with a significant delay in onset of the first exacerbation compared with placebo, and overall it led to the fewest exacerbations per patient-year. Fewer hospital admissions were also demonstrated in the tiotropium group per patient-year, and the number of days that patients were unable to perform usual activities was lowest for the tiotropium group. Again, improvement in TDI and SGRQ scores was significantly greater with tiotropium than placebo. In almost all outcomes, the salmeterol results were intermediate between those of tiotropium and placebo, and were not statistically different from placebo."
"What is the best test to diagnose urinary tract stones
We compare noncontrast enhanced computerized tomography (CT) and excretory urography (IVP) in the evaluation of acute flank pain. A total of 40 consecutive patients presenting to the emergency department with acute flank pain were evaluated with noncontrast CT, films of the kidneys, ureters and bladder, and IVP. The patients were treated according to the clinical picture. All 40 sets of evaluations were later assessed randomly by an independent consultant radiologist for the presence, size and location of a stone, ureteral dilatation and secondary signs of ureteral obstruction. Of 40 patients 12 had no calculus and 28 had a calculus confirmed on removal or documented passage of a stone. Absence of a stone was based on clinical and radiological followup with clinical resolution. CT revealed all 28 calculi and no calculus in 11 of 12 patients with 100% sensitivity and 92% specificity. IVP demonstrated 18 calculi (64% sensitivity) and no calculus in 11 of 12 patients (92% specificity). Ureteral obstruction was seen in 28 of the 40 patients, and CT and IVP were equivalent in detection (100% sensitivity). Films of the kidneys, ureters and bladder alone demonstrated 15 of 28 stones (54% sensitivity). Noncontrast CT is an accurate, safe, rapid technique to assess acute flank pain, and the evaluation of choice for patients who would otherwise require IVP for diagnosis.","The Australian study enrolled 40 consecutive patients. This study compared helical CT with intravenous pyelography (IVP) and used the gold standard of recovery and direct visualization of a stone. In this study, helical CT correctly identified every instance of urinary tract stones. In contrast, IVP failed to detect stones in a third of the patients with stones, and 44% of the negative readings were false-negatives. Both tests did well in reporting negative results for those patients without stones (specificity = 97% for both tests). In terms of likelihood ratios, helical CT and IVP had positive likelihood ratios of 29 and 19, respectively, and negative likelihood ratios of 0 and 0.36 (a lower negative likelihood ratio is better). In other words, helical CT appears to be far superior to IVP in ruling out the presence of urinary tract stones."
"How can you help prevent a recurrence of diverticulitis
A diet high in fiber (particularly fruit and vegetable fiber) and low in fat and red meat may help to decrease the risk of symptomatic diverticular disease (strength of recommendation [SOR]: C, case-control studies and a large prospective cohort study). For people with diverticular disease, a diet high in fiber might decrease the risk of complications (SOR: C, case series). No studies have evaluated the effect of nut and seed avoidance.",A 2006 Family Physicians Inquiries Network Clinical Inquiry on diverticulosis found inconsistent evidence that fiber decreases the risk of symptomatic diverticular disease.
"How can you help prevent a recurrence of diverticulitis
Diverticula (mucosal outpouching through the wall of the colon) affect over 5% of adults aged 40 years and older, but only 10-25% of affected people will develop symptoms such as lower abdominal pain. Recurrent symptoms are common, and 5% of people with diverticula eventually develop complications such as perforation, obstruction, haemorrhage, fistulae, or abscesses. METHODS AND OUTCOMES: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of: treatments for uncomplicated diverticular disease; treatments to prevent complications; and treatments for acute diverticulitis? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to July 2006 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). We found 13 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions. In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: antispasmodics, bran, elective surgery, increasing fibre intake, ispaghula husk, lactulose, medical treatment, mesalazine, methylcellulose, rifaximin, surgery.",A 2007 literature review found no systematic reviews or randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of fiber for preventing complications of diverticular disease. The reviewers noted that observational studies have found less diverticulosis in populations with higher fiber consumption.
"What is the differential diagnosis of chronic diarrhea in immunocompetent patients
A ""quick"" prevalence study of intractable diarrhoea (defined as diarrhoea lasting more than 3 weeks and dependent on parenteral nutrition [PN] for more than 50% of daily caloric intake) was conducted by FAX. All 35 paediatric gastroenterology services which had been contacted answered questionnaire sent by FAX. 20 cases of intractable diarrhoea were identified in 9 centres. In 12 cases PN was administered at home, the other 8 cases being treated as inpatients for an average duration of 9.5 months. A diagnosis had been established in 11 out of 20 cases. Auto-immune enteropathy was the most frequent diagnosis (5 cases); congenital microvillous atrophy (3 cases); chronic pseudo-obstruction (2 cases) and multiple food intolerance (1 case). Undefined 9/20 cases presented atrophy of intestinal mucosa. The age of the beginning of diarrhoea varied from 2 days to 12 years, but was more than 16 months only in some cases with auto-immune enteropathy. CONCLUSION: Intractable diarrhoea has a low prevalence in Italy and remains a rare but very intricating problem. Long-term PN is recommended in most cases: autoimmune enteropathy is the most frequent cause but in about half of the cases the aetiopathogenetic diagnosis is still not defined.","A small tertiary-care pediatric study defining chronic diarrhea as occurring for more than 3 weeks and dependent on parenteral nutrition for more than 50% of daily caloric intake included only 20 patients. The diagnoses included autoimmune enteropathy, congenital microvillous atrophy, chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction, and multiple food intolerance."
"What is the differential diagnosis of chronic diarrhea in immunocompetent patients
The value of proximal intestinal mucosal biopsy was reviewed in 381 children presenting with chronic diarrhoea over an eight year period. An enteropathy was detected in 44% of cases and was more frequently seen in those aged less than 6 months. A diagnosis was established in 91% of cases. The most common diagnosis was the postenteritis syndrome where the presence of an enteropathy indicated those requiring treatment with a cows' milk free diet. Other conditions where a biopsy facilitated diagnosis or treatment included giardiasis, enteropathogenic Escheriichia coli, crytosporidiosis, autoimmune enteropathy, and microvillous atrophy. Coeliac disease was considered in 55% of children and established in 8%, clearly identifying those requiring a gluten free diet. This also emphasises the important role of the biopsy procedure in the exclusion of specific diseases. Proximal small intestinal mucosal biopsy is an essential investigation in children with chronic diarrhoea in whom an enteropathy is suspected.","A pedriatic study included 381 children from a tertiary-care center with chronic diarrhea defined as lasting longer than 14 days. In this case series, 31% of children had toddler's diarrhea, defined as chronic diarrhea with no definitive cause in an otherwise healthy baby who is growing normally. Cow's milk sensitivity enteropathy comprised an additional 30% of cases. Etiologies for diarrhea in the remaining cases were infectious (11.8%), idiopathic (8.9%), celiac (7.3%), and other (10.2%)."
"What is the dietary treatment for low HDL cholesterol
To determine the effects of carbohydrate restriction (CR) with and without soluble fiber on lipoprotein metabolism, 29 men participated in a 12-wk weight loss intervention. Subjects were matched by age and BMI and randomly assigned to consume 3 g/d of either a soluble fiber supplement (n=14) or placebo (n=15) with a macronutrient energy distribution of approximately 10% carbohydrate, approximately 65% fat, and approximately 25% protein. Because the groups did not differ in any of the variables measured, all data were pooled and comparisons were made between baseline and 12 wk. After 12 wk, subjects had a mean weight loss of 7.5 kg (P<0.001), and abdominal fat was reduced by 20% (P<0.001). Plasma LDL cholesterol and triglycerides (TG) were significantly reduced by 8.9 and 38.6%, respectively. Similarly, apolipoproteins C-I (-13.8%), C-III (-21.2%) and E (-12.5%) were significantly lower after the intervention. In contrast plasma HDL-cholesterol concentrations were increased by 12% (P<0.05). Changes in plasma TG were positively correlated with reductions in large (r=0.615, P<0.01) and medium VLDL particles (r=0.432, P<0.05) and negatively correlated with LDL diameter (r=-0.489, P<0.01). Changes in trunk fat were positively correlated with medium VLDL (r=0.474, P<0.0) and small LDL (r=0.405, P<0.05) and negatively correlated with large HDL (r=-0.556, P<0.01). We conclude that weight loss induced by CR favorably alters the secretion and processing of plasma lipoproteins, rendering VLDL, LDL, and HDL particles associated with decreased risk for atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease.","A systematic review with meta-analysis of 23 RCTs evaluating effect of various amounts of soy protein with isoflavones on lipid profile found a 3% increase in HDL with an absolute difference 1.5 mg/dL (95% CI, 0.0-2.8)."
"What is the dietary treatment for low HDL cholesterol
While vigorous exercise, alcohol, and weight loss are all known to increase high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C), it is not known whether these interventions increase low HDL as effectively as has been demonstrated for normal HDL. This report tests the hypothesis that there may be differences in the calculated response of men and women with low versus high HDL-C to exercise, alcohol, and weight loss across the spectrum of HDL-C levels. Physican-supplied medical data from 7,288 men and 2,326 women were divided into deciles of self-reported vigorous exercise, alcohol intake, body mass index (BMI), or body circumferences. Within each decile we determined the percentiles of the HDL distributions and average running distance, alcohol intake, BMI, or body circumference. Simple least-squares regression analysis was then used to estimate the slope for kth HDL percentile (k = 5%, 6%, ...,95%) versus running distance, alcohol intake, BMI, or body circumference across deciles. Bootstrap resampling was used to estimate standard errors and statistical significance for the regression lines. In both sexes, the increase in HDL-C per unit alcohol intake was at least twice as great at the 95th as at the 5th percentile of the HDL distribution. There was also a significant graded increase from the 5th to the 95th HDL percentile for the slopes relating HDL to exercise (km run) and alcohol intake. Men's HDL-C declined in association with fatness (BMI, waist, and chest circumference) more sharply at the 95th than at the 5th percentile of the HDL distribution. The results of this study suggest that the effects of physical activity, alcohol, and weight reduction on HDL-C levels may be, to a large extent, dependent on the initial level with the greatest improvement achieved in subjects with high HDL and the least improvement in those having low HDL-C levels.",An uncontrolled prospective trial showed a 12% increase in HDL.
"What is the dietary treatment for low HDL cholesterol
Low-carbohydrate diets have become increasingly popular for weight loss. However, evidence from individual trials about benefits and risks of these diets to achieve weight loss and modify cardiovascular risk factors is preliminary. We used the Cochrane Collaboration search strategy to identify trials comparing the effects of low-carbohydrate diets without restriction of energy intake vs low-fat diets in individuals with a body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters) of at least 25. Included trials had to report changes in body weight in intention-to-treat analysis and to have a follow-up of at least 6 months. Two reviewers independently assessed trial eligibility and quality of randomized controlled trials. Five trials including a total of 447 individuals fulfilled our inclusion criteria. After 6 months, individuals assigned to low-carbohydrate diets had lost more weight than individuals randomized to low-fat diets (weighted mean difference, -3.3 kg; 95% confidence interval [CI], -5.3 to -1.4 kg). This difference was no longer obvious after 12 months (weighted mean difference, -1.0 kg; 95% CI, -3.5 to 1.5 kg). There were no differences in blood pressure. Triglyceride and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol values changed more favorably in individuals assigned to low-carbohydrate diets (after 6 months, for triglycerides, weighted mean difference, -22.1 mg/dL [-0.25 mmol/L]; 95% CI, -38.1 to -5.3 mg/dL [-0.43 to -0.06 mmol/L]; and for high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, weighted mean difference, 4.6 mg/dL [0.12 mmol/L]; 95% CI, 1.5-8.1 mg/dL [0.04-0.21 mmol/L]), but total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol values changed more favorably in individuals assigned to low-fat diets (weighted mean difference in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol after 6 months, 5.4 mg/dL [0.14 mmol/L]; 95% CI, 1.2-10.1 mg/dL [0.03-0.26 mmol/L]). Low-carbohydrate, non-energy-restricted diets appear to be at least as effective as low-fat, energy-restricted diets in inducing weight loss for up to 1 year. However, potential favorable changes in triglyceride and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol values should be weighed against potential unfavorable changes in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol values when low-carbohydrate diets to induce weight loss are considered.",The DASH diet was studied as an intervention in a RCT of 116 patients with the metabolic syndrome. Men responded with an in crease of 21% and women with an increase of 33%.
"When are antibiotics indicated for acute COPD exacerbations
The effects of broad-spectrum antibiotic and placebo therapy in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in exacerbation were compared in a randomized, double-blinded, crossover trial. Exacerbations were defined in terms of increased dyspnea, sputum production, and sputum purulence. Exacerbations were followed at 3-day intervals by home visits, and those that resolved in 21 days were designated treatment successes. Treatment failures included exacerbations in which symptoms did not resolve but no intervention was necessary, and those in which the patient's condition deteriorated so that intervention was necessary. Over 3.5 years in 173 patients, 362 exacerbations were treated, 180 with placebo and 182 with antibiotic. The success rate with placebo was 55% and with antibiotic 68%. The rate of failure with deterioration was 19% with placebo and 10% with antibiotic. There was a significant benefit associated with antibiotic. Peak flow recovered more rapidly with antibiotic treatment than with placebo. Side effects were uncommon and did not differ between antibiotic and placebo.","A Cochrane review identified a Danish RCT that studied 278 patients presenting to their general practitioners with subjective acute worsening of their COPD. Patients were randomized to 7 days of oral amoxicillin or placebo. There was no difference between the groups in terms of symptom resolution at 1 week (odds ratio=1.03, favoring placebo; 95% CI, 0.75-1.41) or in changes in PEFR (weighted mean difference=-0.89, favoring placebo; 95% CI, -29 to 27 L/min)."
"How should you manage a depressed patient unresponsive to an SSRI
Evidence of the antidepressant efficacy of lamotrigine is increasing, although there are no placebo-controlled trials of lamotrigine augmentation in depression. The aim of this study was to assess if augmentation with lamotrigine was superior to placebo in patients who were receiving fluoxetine for resistant major depressive episodes. Twenty-three patients who had experienced at least 1 major depressive episode that was resistant to at least 1 prior trial of antidepressant therapy were selected. These patients were treated with fluoxetine, 20 mg/day, and concomitantly randomly assigned to receive either lamotrigine (N = 13) or placebo (N = 10) for 6 weeks. The dose of lamotrigine was titrated upward from 25 mg/day to 100 mg/day. Patients suffering from bipolar II disorder (N = 8) or from major depressive disorder (N = 15) (DSM-IV criteria) were enrolled, resulting in heterogeneity of the sample. The primary outcome measure was Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression score. Data were collected from 2000-2001. Lamotrigine was statistically superior to placebo on the Clinical Global Impressions scale at endpoint, both in absolute terms (mean +/- SD Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness scores: lamotrigine, 2.15 +/- 1.28; placebo, 3.40 +/- 1.17; p =.0308) and using a responder analysis, with response defined as a Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement score of 2 or less (lamotrigine, 84.62% [N = 11]; placebo, 30.00% [N = 3]; p =.013). The effect of lamotrigine on Clinical Global Impressions scale scores was seen in both major depressive disorder and bipolar II disorder. Lamotrigine, however, failed to separate statistically from placebo on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression and Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale. This failure to differentiate on a primary outcome measure is essentially a negative study result. This result is most likely an artifact of the small sample size used and the resultant limited power of the study. The results of this trial add to the literature suggesting potential efficacy of the antidepressant profile of lamotrigine. In addition, this study points to a possible role of lamotrigine as an augmentation agent in depression.",A small (23-patient) randomized trial of lamotrigine (Lamictal) suggests that it may augment the effect of fluoxetine.
"How should you manage a depressed patient unresponsive to an SSRI
In medication-resistant patients with major depressive disorder, the response rate with bilateral electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) drops to 50% from the expected range of 80% to 90%. Relapse rates following ECT are high in medication-resistant depressed patients and are clustered in the first 4 months following clinical response. Medication resistance during the index episode predicts a high rate of relapse, whereas those patients who have not received an adequate medication trial prior to ECT are less likely to relapse. If a patient who fails an antidepressant trial then responds to a course of ECT, alternative pharmacologic strategies or maintenance ECT should be considered to decrease the likelihood of relapse. Patients who do not respond to a traditional course of bilateral ECT may respond subsequently to longer courses of bilateral ECT at markedly suprathreshold stimulus intensity, or may respond to a different class of antidepressant medication from that which they failed previously.",The evidence supporting use of ECT for treatment-resistant depression comes from studies following failure of treatment with tricyclic antidepressants and monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors. Methodological problems in these older studies do not permit an estimate of response rate.
"At what age do patients no longer need colorectal cancer screening
Case-control studies and a voluntary-based follow-up study have suggested that repeated screening with faecal-occult-blood (FOB) tests can lead to a reduction in mortality from colorectal cancer (CRC). The aim of this randomised study was to compare mortality rates after FOB tests every 2 years during a 10-year period with those of unscreened similar controls. 140,000 people aged 45-75 years lived in Funen, Denmark, in August, 1985, and were considered for inclusion in our study. Before randomisation we excluded individuals who had CRC or precursor adenomas and those who had taken part in a previous pilot study. Randomisation of 137,485 people in blocks of 14 allocated three per 14 to the screening group (30,967), three per 14 to the control group (30,966), and eight not to be enrolled in the study (75,552). Controls were not told about the study and continued to use health-care facilities as normal. Hemoccult-II blood tests (with dietary restrictions but without rehydration) were sent to screening-group participants. Only those participants who completed the first screening round were invited for further screening--five rounds of screening during a 10-year period. Participants with positive tests were asked to attend to full examination and were offered colonoscopy whenever possible. The primary endpoint was death from CRC. Of the 30,967 screening-group participants, 20,672 (67%) completed the first screening round and were invited for further screening; more than 90% accepted repeated screenings. During the 10-year study, 481 people in the screening group had a diagnosis of CRC, compared with 483 unscreened controls. There were 205 deaths attributable to CRC in the screening group, compared with 249 deaths in controls. CRC mortality, including deaths attributable to complications from CRC treatment, was significantly lower in the screening group than in controls (mortality ratio 0.82 [95% CI 0.68-0.99]) p = 0.03). Our findings indicate that biennial screening by FOB tests can reduce CRC mortality. This study is being continued to improve its statistical power and to assess the effect of the removal of more precursor adenomas in the screening-group participants than in controls on CRC incidence.",The upper age limits of patients was 75.
"What treatments are effective for varicose veins
Injection sclerotherapy for varicose veins has been used widely since 1963, following popularisation of the technique by Fegan. The treatment aims to obliterate the lumen of varicose veins or thread veins, however, there is limited evidence regarding its efficacy. To determine whether sclerotherapy is effective in terms of symptomatic improvement and cosmetic appearance; has an acceptable complication rate; and to define rates of symptomatic or cosmetic varicose vein recurrence following sclerotherapy. Publications describing randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of injection sclerotherapy for varicose veins (excluding comparisons with surgery) were sought through EMBASE and MEDLINE (from inception to March 2001) and hand-searching relevant journals, using the search strategy described by the Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Review Group. Bibliographies of papers identified were examined for further RCTs. Manufacturers of sclerosants were contacted for further trial information. RCTs of injection sclerotherapy versus graduated compression stockings or 'observation', or comparing different sclerosants, doses and post-compression bandaging techniques on patients with symptomatic and/or cosmetic varicose veins or thread veins were considered for inclusion in the review. Ten studies were included in the analysis. These compared: sodium tetradecyl sulphate (STD) versus an alternative sclerosant; sclerosant with or without local anaesthetic; application of Molefoam versus Sorbo pads to injection sites; elastic compression bandaging versus conventional bandaging; and short-term bandaging versus standard bandaging. Data were abstracted by both authors. No RCTs compared sclerotherapy to graduated compression stockings or other non-surgical treatments. Two studies compared STD to alternative sclerosants and found no significant differences in outcome or complication rates. Adding local anaesthetic to sclerosant reduced the pain from injection (one study) but had no other effects. Comparison of Molefoam and Sorbo pad pressure dressings found no difference in outcome for erythema (redness) or successful sclerosis. The degree and duration of elastic compression had no significant effect on varicose vein recurrence rates, cosmetic appearance or symptomatic improvement. Increased compression prevented slipping of dressings but caused increased discomfort, as did increasing duration of compression. Evidence from RCTs suggests that type of sclerosant, local pressure dressing, degree and length of compression have no significant effect on the efficacy of sclerotherapy for varicose veins. This supports the current place of sclerotherapy in modern clinical practice, which is usually limited to treatment of recurrent varicose veins following surgery, and thread veins. A comparison of surgery versus sclerotherapy would be valuable.","A Cochrane review concluded that existing evidence supports the use of sclerotherapy for recurrent varicose veins after surgery and for relatively minor ""thread"" veins. Data did not show that any particular type of sclerosant or pressure dressing or duration of post-treatment compression have significant effect on outcomes, such as disappearance of varicosities and cosmetic improvement."
"Is osteoporosis screening in postmenopausal women effective
Although mass screening for osteoporosis is not recommended among postmenopausal women, there is no consensus on which women should undergo testing for low bone mineral density. The objective of this study was to develop and validate a clinical tool to help clinicians identify which women are at increased risk for osteoporosis and should therefore undergo further testing with bone densitometry. Using Ontario baseline data from the Canadian Multicentre Osteoporosis Study, we identified all cognitively normal women aged 45 years or more who had undergone testing with dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) at both the femoral neck and the lumbar spine (L1-L4). Participants who had a previous diagnosis of osteoporosis or were taking bone active medication other than ovarian hormones were excluded. The main outcome measure was low bone mineral density (T score of 2 or more standard deviations below the mean for young Canadian women) at either the femoral neck or the lumbar spine. Logistic regression analysis and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis were used to identify the simplest algorithm that would identify women at increased risk for low bone mineral density. The study population comprised 1376 women, of whom 926 were allocated to the development of the tool and 450 to its validation. A simple algorithm based on age, weight and current estrogen use (yes or no) was developed. Validation of this 3-item Osteoporosis Risk Assessment Instrument (ORAI) showed that the tool had a sensitivity of 93.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] 86.3%-97.0%) and a specificity of 46.4% (95% CI 41.0%-51.8%) for selecting women with low bone mineral density. The sensitivity of the instrument for selecting women with osteoporosis was 94.4% (95% CI 83.7%-98.6%). Use of the ORAI represented a 38.7% reduction in DXA testing compared with screening all women in our study. The ORAI accurately identifies the vast majority of women likely to have low bone mineral density and is effective in substantially decreasing the need for all women to undergo DXA testing.","For women aged >65 years with no other risks, 12% to 28% have osteoporosis."
"Is osteoporosis screening in postmenopausal women effective
To review the effect of risedronate on bone density and fractures in postmenopausal women. We searched MEDLINE from 1966 to the end of 2000 and examined citations of relevant articles and the proceedings of international osteoporosis meetings. We included eight randomized, placebo-controlled trials of postmenopausal women receiving risedronate or placebo with a follow-up of at least one year and providing data on bone density or fracture rate. For each trial, two independent reviewers assessed the methodological quality and abstracted data. The major methodological limitation of the trials was the loss to follow-up, which was over 20% in most trials and over 35% in the largest study. However, the magnitude of the treatment effect was unrelated to loss to follow-up, and in one of the largest trials, more high-risk patients were lost to follow-up in the control than in the treatment group. The pooled relative risk (RR) for vertebral fractures in women given 2.5 mg or more of risedronate was 0.64 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.54, 0.77]. The pooled RR of nonvertebral fractures in patients given 2.5 mg or more of risedronate was 0.73 (95% CI 0.61, 0.87). Risedronate produced positive effects on the percentage change in bone density of the lumbar spine, combined forearm, and femoral neck that were generally larger with the 5-mg daily dose than with cyclical administration or the 2.5-mg dose. The pooled estimate of the difference in percentage change between 5 mg risedronate and placebo after the final year of treatment (1.5-3 yr) was 4.54% (95% CI 4.12, 4.97) for the lumbar spine, and 2.75% (95% CI 2.32, 3.17) at the femoral neck. Risedronate substantially reduces the risk of both vertebral and nonvertebral fractures. This fracture reduction is accompanied by an increase in bone density of the lumbar spine and femoral neck in both early postmenopausal women and those with established osteoporosis.","A meta-analysis of 11 randomized controlled trials including 11,808 women found fewer hip fractures in women taking 10 mg/day of alendronate (RR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.38-0.69; number needed to treat [NNT]=24), and fewer vertebral fractures in women taking 5 mg/day of alendronate (RR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.43-0.65; NNT=72)."
"Is osteoporosis screening in postmenopausal women effective
Although osteoporotic fractures present an enormous health burden, it is not clear whether screening to identify high-risk persons is appropriate. To examine evidence on the benefits and harms of screening postmenopausal women for osteoporosis. MEDLINE (1966 to May 2001), HealthSTAR (1975 to May 2001), and Cochrane databases; reference lists; and experts. English-language abstracts that included original data about postmenopausal women and osteoporosis and addressed the effectiveness of risk factor assessment, bone density tests, or treatment were included. Selected information about patient population, interventions, clinical end points, and study design were extracted, and a set of criteria was applied to evaluate study quality. No trials of the effectiveness of screening have been published. Instruments developed to assess clinical risk factors for low bone density or fractures have moderate to high sensitivity and low specificity. Among different bone density tests measured at various sites, bone density measured at the femoral neck by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry is the best predictor of hip fracture. Women with low bone density have approximately a 40% to 50% reduction in fracture risk when treated with bisphosphonates. Population screening would be based on evidence that the risk for osteoporosis and fractures increases with age, that the short-term risk for fracture can be estimated by bone density tests and risk factors, and that fracture risk can be reduced with treatment. The role of risk factor assessment and different bone density techniques, frequency of screening, and identification of subgroups for which screening is most effective remain unclear.","Based on their outcomes model, the US Preventive Services Task Force recommends screening for women aged >65 years, and those aged 60 to 65 years who have risk factors."
"Is an outpatient workup safe for patients with a transient ischemic attack
To estimate the very early stroke risk after a transient ischaemic attack (TIA) or minor stroke and thereby inform the planning of effective stroke prevention services. Population based prospective cohort study of patients with TIA or stroke. Nine general practices in Oxfordshire, England, from April 2002 to April 2003. All patients who had a TIA (n = 87) or minor stroke (n = 87) during the study period and who presented to medical attention. Risk of recurrent stroke at seven days, one month, and three months after TIAs and minor strokes. The estimated risk of recurrent stroke was 8.0% (95% confidence interval 2.3% to 13.7%) at seven days, 11.5% (4.8% to 18.2%) at one month, and 17.3% (9.3% to 25.3%) at three months after a TIA. The risks at these three time periods after a minor stroke were 11.5% (4.8% to 11.2%), 15.0% (7.5% to 22.5%), and 18.5% (10.3% to 26.7%). The early risks of stroke after a TIA or minor stroke are much higher than commonly quoted. More research is needed to determine whether these risks can be reduced by more rapid instigation of preventive treatment.",A large prospective cohort study recently estimated the risk of stroke after a TIA or minor stroke to be 8% to 12% at 7 days and 11% to 15% at 1 month.
"What are the current treatment and monitoring recommendations for hepatitis C virus HCV
Only 15 to 20 percent of patients with chronic hepatitis C have a sustained virologic response to interferon therapy. We compared the efficacy and safety of recombinant interferon alfa-2b alone with those of a combination of interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin for the initial treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis C. We randomly assigned 912 patients with chronic hepatitis C to receive standard-dose interferon alfa-2b alone or in combination with ribavirin (1000 or 1200 mg orally per day, depending on body weight) for 24 or 48 weeks. Efficacy was assessed by measurements of serum hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA and serum aminotransferases and by liver biopsy. The rate of sustained virologic response (defined as an undetectable serum HCV RNA level 24 weeks after treatment was completed) was higher among patients who received combination therapy for either 24 weeks (70 of 228 patients, 31 percent) or 48 weeks (87 of 228 patients, 38 percent) than among patients who received interferon alone for either 24 weeks (13 of 231 patients, 6 percent) or 48 weeks (29 of 225 patients, 13 percent) (P<0.001 for the comparison of interferon alone with both 24 weeks and 48 weeks of combination treatment). Among patients with HCV genotype 1 infection, the best response occurred in those who were treated for 48 weeks with interferon and ribavirin. Histologic improvement was more common in patients who were treated with combination therapy for either 24 weeks (57 percent) or 48 weeks (61 percent) than in those who were treated with interferon alone for either 24 weeks (44 percent) or 48 weeks (41 percent). The drug doses had to be reduced and treatment discontinued more often in patients who were treated with combination therapy. In patients with chronic hepatitis C, initial therapy with interferon and ribavirin was more effective than treatment with interferon alone.","Several randomized trials have shown that dual therapy with PEG-interferon alpha-2b (3 million units subcutaneously 3 times weekly) and ribavirin (1000 mg to 1200 mg orally each day) is at least twice as effective as interferon alone. The best results were seen in women who had a genotype other than 1, low viral loads, and absence of cirrhosis at the outset."
"What is the best diagnostic approach to paresthesias of the hand
History taking and physical examination maneuvers, including Tinel and Phalen signs, are widely used for the diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). To systematically review the precision and accuracy of history taking and physical examination in diagnosing CTS in adults. English-language literature was searched using MEDLINE (January 1966-February 2000) as well as bibliographies of relevant articles. Studies of patients presenting to clinicians with symptoms suggestive of CTS in which findings from clearly described physical examination maneuvers were independently compared with electrodiagnostic testing. Twelve of 42 initially identified articles met these criteria and were included in the review. Two authors independently reviewed and abstracted data from all of the articles and reached consensus about any discrepancies. In patients presenting with hand dysesthesias, the findings that best distinguish between patients with electrodiagnostic evidence of CTS and patients without it are hypalgesia in the median nerve territory (likelihood ratio [LR], 3. 1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.0-5.1), classic or probable Katz hand diagram results (LR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.6-3.5), and weak thumb abduction strength (LR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.4-2.3). Findings that argue against the diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome are unlikely Katz hand diagram results (LR, 0.2; 95% CI, 0.0-0.7) and normal thumb abduction strength (LR, 0.5; 95% CI, 0.4-0.7). Several traditional findings of CTS have little or no diagnostic value, including nocturnal paresthesias; Phalen and Tinel signs; thenar atrophy; and 2-point, vibratory, and monofilament sensory testing. Other less commonly used maneuvers, including the square wrist sign, flick sign, and closed fist sign, require validation by other studies before they can be recommended. Hand symptom diagrams, hypalgesia, and thumb abduction strength testing are helpful in establishing the [corrected] electrodiagnosis of CTS. The utility of these results is limited, however, by problems inherent in using nerve conduction studies as a criterion standard. JAMA. 2000.","A meta-analysis of studies reviewing the precision and accuracy of the history and physical examination in the diagnosis of CTS in adults found that hypoalgesia (LR+, 3.1), classic or probable hand diagram results (LR+ 2.4, LR- 0.2), and weak thumb abduction strength (weakness of resisted movement of the thumb at right angles to the palm; LR+ 1.8, LR- 0.5) best distinguish those with and those without CTS. A classical distribution is in that of the median nerve, while a probable distribution involves the entire palmar surface. The reference standard for these studies was a nerve conduction study. Nocturnal paresthesias, Phalen and Tinel signs, and thenar atrophy had little or no diagnostic utility."
"How effective are exercise and physical therapy for chronic low back pain
Criteria-based review. Reviews based on trials published up to 1990 conclude that the efficacy of exercise therapy in patients with low back pain is questionable. To determine from recently published trials the efficacy of exercises in patients with acute, subacute, or chronic back pain. A Medline search for randomized trials concerning exercise therapy in patients with back pain published from 1991 until the first quarter of 1995 was conducted. All studies were given a method score (maximum, 100 points). Eleven randomized trials were included: four in acute back pain, one in subacute, and six in patients with chronic back pain. Three trials had method scores lower than 40 points. For acute back pain, two trials with high method scores (> 50 points) reported no efficacy of flexion or extension exercises; two trials of the McKenzie type of exercises reported positive results but had low method scores. For subacute pain, one trial (> 50 points) reported positive results of exercises with a graded activity program. For chronic back pain, three trials reported positive results with different types of exercises; two trials reported better results with intensive exercising compared with low grade exercising, but after 12 months, this effect had disappeared. In chronic pain, no relation between method score and conclusions could be found. In acute back pain, exercise therapy is ineffective, whereas in subacute back pain, exercises with a graded activity program, and in chronic back pain, intensive exercising, deserve attention. More research on McKenzie therapy, on exercises with a graded activity program, and on different types of exercising in patients with chronic back pain is necessary.","A 1996 review of 13 RCTs examining specific types of exercises found that both intensive dynamic extension exercises and mild isometric flexion and extension exercises were more effective than placebo. Although the intensive exercises were more efficacious than normal exercises at the 3-month follow-up, they were equally efficacious at 12 months. Evidence was conflicting in a comparison of flexion and extension exercises."
"What is the most effective management of acute fractures of the base of the fifth metatarsal
There is considerable variability in the literature concerning the optimal treatment of acute Jones fractures. Early surgical fixation of acute Jones fractures will result in shorter times to union and return to athletics compared with cast treatment. Randomized controlled clinical trial; Level of evidence, 1. Eighteen patients were randomized to cast treatment, and 19 patients were randomized to screw fixation. Success of treatment and the times to union and return to sports were calculated for each patient. Mean follow-up was 25.3 months (range, 15-42 months). Eight of 18 (44%) in the cast group were considered treatment failures: 5 nonunions, 1 delayed union, and 2 refractures. One of 19 patients in the surgery group was considered a treatment failure. For the surgery group, the median times to union and return to sports were 7.5 and 8.0 weeks, respectively. For the cast group, the median times were 14.5 and 15.0 weeks, respectively. The Mann-Whitney test showed a statistically significant difference between the groups in both parameters, with P < 001. There is a high incidence (44%) of failure after cast treatment of acute Jones fractures. Early screw fixation results in quicker times to union and return to sports compared with cast treatment.","37 active-duty military personnel with acute Jones' fractures were randomized to either 8 weeks of no weight-bearing in a short leg casting, followed by a walking cast or hard-soled shoe until clinical union; or to early outpatient intramedullary screw fixation followed by no weight-bearing for 2 weeks, then weight-bearing as tolerated in a hard-soled shoe until clinical union. Screw fixation significantly reduced both time to clinical union and time to return to sports-by nearly 50% when compared with non-weightbearing short leg casting. Furthermore, at 26 weeks the casting group saw a significant 44% failure rate compared with only 5% in the surgical group (number needed to treat [NNT]=2.6). Six patients in the surgical group had mild discomfort from the screw head, and 3 needed the screw to be removed. Generalization of the results was limited by the mostly male military population."
"What are effective therapies for Clostridium difficile- associated diarrhea
OBJECTIVE--To determine the safety and efficacy of a new combination treatment for patients with Clostridium difficile-associated disease (CDD). The treatment combines the yeast Saccharomyces boulardii with an antibiotic (vancomycin hydrochloride or metronidazole). DESIGN--A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group intervention study in patients with active CDD. Patients received standard antibiotics and S boulardii or placebo for 4 weeks, and were followed up for an additional 4 weeks after therapy. Effectiveness was determined by comparing the recurrence of CDD in the two groups using multivariate analysis to control for other risk factors for CDD. SETTING--National referral study of ambulatory or hospitalized patients from three main study coordinating centers. PATIENTS--A total of 124 eligible consenting adult patients, including 64 who were enrolled with an initial episode of CDD, and 60 who had a history of at least one prior CDD episode. Patients who were immunosuppressed due to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome or cancer chemotherapy within 3 months were not eligible. INTERVENTION--Treatment with oral S boulardii (1 g/d for 4 weeks) or placebo in combination with a standard antibiotic. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Recurrence of active CDD. RESULTS--A history of CDD episodes dramatically increased the likelihood of further recurrences. Multivariate analysis revealed that patients treated with S boulardii and standard antibiotics had a significantly lower relative risk (RR) of CDD recurrence (RR, 0.43; 95% confidence interval, 0.20 to 0.97) compared with placebo and standard antibiotics. The efficacy of S boulardii was significant (recurrence rate 34.6%, compared with 64.7% on placebo; P = .04) in patients with recurrent CDD, but not in patients with initial CDD (recurrence rate 19.3% compared with 24.2% on placebo; P = .86). There were no serious adverse reactions associated with S boulardii. CONCLUSIONS--The combination of standard antibiotics and S boulardii was shown to be an effective and safe therapy for these patients with recurrent CDD; no benefit of S boulardii was demonstrated for those with an initial episode of CDD.","A randomized, double-blinded, placebocontrolled study evaluated the impact of adding the probiotic agent Saccharomyces boulardii. to either metronidazole or vancomycin. For persons with recurrent infection, addition of S boulardii. led to a 30% decrease in the absolute risk of relapse (64% relapse vs 34%; number needed to treat=3; P.<.05). There was also a nonsignificant trend toward reduced recurrences in the treatment of primary infections. The 2 minor side effects noted with this treatment were dry mouth (number needed to harm [NNH]=11) and constipation (NNH=9). S boulardii. capsules are available from health food stores and via the Internet. Several published case series describe various additional approaches to therapy of recurrent CDAD."
"When and how should you evaluate a child for obstructive sleep apnea
To review literature on epidemiology, complications, diagnosis, and treatment of childhood obstructive sleep apnoea. Literature search of MEDLINE up to July 2004 using the following key words: 'obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome', 'children', 'epidemiology', 'complications', 'treatment', and 'polysomnography'. Literature and data related to the aspects of childhood obstructive sleep apnoea. Relevant information and data were reviewed by the authors. There is a paucity of normal data on childhood obstructive sleep apnoea. Varying definitions and diagnostic criteria have been used in different studies, making direct comparison difficult. However, a small-scale local study found that the prevalence and clinical features of this condition were similar to data published overseas. Increasing evidence suggests that childhood obstructive sleep apnoea is associated with cardiovascular morbidity and neurocognitive dysfunction. Overnight polysomnography has remained the gold standard for diagnosing obstructive sleep apnoea but the diagnostic criteria has not been standardised nor correlated with the long-term outcome. Surgical intervention has remained the treatment of choice, although alternative therapies are being evaluated. Consensus on the various important aspects of childhood obstructive sleep apnoea is still limited, especially the definition, diagnosis, and long-term sequelae of this condition. Further advances can only be made with international collaborative research, using evidence-based definitions, standardised techniques, and polysomnographic criteria.",Experts advise screening all children for obstructive sleep apnea by asking about snoring and sleep apnea at routine health supervision visits.
"When and how should you evaluate a child for obstructive sleep apnea
To assess the presence of a first night effect (FNE) in children and adolescents and to examine if a single night polysomnography (PSG) is sufficient for diagnosing obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS). Prospective case study of 70 patients (group 1: 2-6 years, n = 22; group 2: 7-12 years, n = 32; group 3: 13-17 years, n = 16) referred for OSAS. Diagnostic criteria for OSAS: one or more of the following: (1) obstructive apnoea index (OAI) > or =1; (2) obstructive apnoea hypopnoea index (oAHI) > or =2; (3) SaO2 < or =89% in association with obstruction. In all age groups, but mainly in the oldest children, REMS increased during the second night, mainly at the expense of stage 2 sleep. The first night PSG correctly identified OSAS in 86%, 91%, and 100% of the children for groups 1, 2, and 3 respectively. This represents 9% false negatives for OSAS when only the first night PSG was used. All cases missed had mild OSAS, except for one with oAHI >5 on night 2. There were also seven patients with OSAS on night 1 but with a normal PSG on night 2: all had oAHI <5. There is a FNE in children and adolescents. A single night PSG is sufficient for diagnosing OSAS, but in cases with a suggestive history and examination and with a negative first night, a second night study might be advisable.","A study recruited 70 consecutive children (ages 2 to 17 years) from a sleep lab and performed polysomnography on 2 consecutive nights. The first test correctly identified obstructive sleep apnea in 64 children; the second identified 6 additional cases, all of which were ""mild""."
"When and how should you evaluate a child for obstructive sleep apnea
Overnight polysomnography (ONP) is the ""gold standard"" for the diagnosis of sleep-disordered breathing, but it is expensive and time-consuming. Thus, daytime nap studies have been used as screening tests. If the findings of a nap study are normal or mildly abnormal, should ONP be performed? Do specific abnormalities in nap studies predict abnormal findings in ONP? To answer these questions, we conducted this study. Retrospective chart review. Children's hospital. One hundred forty-three children with suspected obstructive sleep apnea syndrome secondary to isolated adenotonsillar hypertrophy, who had normal or mildly abnormal nap studies, and underwent ONP. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTs: We compared daytime nap and overnight polysomnograms in 143 children (52 girls; mean [+/- SD] age, 5.6 +/- 3.1 years). Total sleep time was 1 h in daytime nap, and 5.1 +/- 1.3 h in ONP. The interval between the two studies was 5.9 +/- 4.8 months. The findings of 59% of the nap studies were mildly abnormal, while 66% of overnight studies were abnormal. No individual nap study parameter (including short obstructive apneas, hypopneas, hypoxemia, hypoventilation, snoring, paradoxical breathing, gasping, retractions) had good sensitivity at predicting abnormal overnight polysomnograms, but most had good specificity and positive predictive value. We conclude that individual nap study parameters are not very sensitive in predicting abnormal ONP findings. However, when nap study parameters are abnormal, the chance of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome is high.","A retrospective chart review included 143 children between 1 and 18 years of age with adenotonsillar hypertrophy referred for overnight polysomnography after normal or mildly abnormal ""nap polysomnography."" Mildly abnormal nap polysomnography predicted abnormal overnight polysomnography (PPV=77%; P<.0001), but normal nap polysomnography were not predictive of normal overnight polysomnography (NPV=49%; P=.8)."
"Do antibiotics interfere with the efficacy of oral contraceptives
With the exception of rifampin-like drugs, there is a lack of scientific evidence supporting the ability of commonly prescribed antibiotics, including all those routinely employed in outpatient dentistry, to either reduce blood levels and/or the effectiveness of oral contraceptives. To date, all clinical trials studying the effects of concomitant antibiotic therapy (with the exception of rifampin and rifabutin) have failed to demonstrate an interaction. Like all drugs, oral contraceptives are not 100% effective with the failure rate in the typical United States population reported to be as high as 3%. It is thus possible that the case reports of unintended pregnancies during antibiotic therapy may simply represent the normal failure rate of these drugs. Considering that both drug classes are prescribed frequently to women of childbearing potential, one would expect a much higher rate of oral contraceptive failure in this group of patients if a true drug:drug interaction existed. On the other hand, if the interaction does exist but is a relatively rare event, occurring in, say, 1 in 5000 women, clinical studies such as those described in this article would not detect the interaction. The pharmacokinetic studies of simultaneous antibiotic and oral contraceptive ingestion, and the retrospective studies of pregnancy rates among oral contraceptive users exposed to antibiotics, all suffer from one potential common weakness, i.e., their relatively small sample size. Sample sizes in the pharmacokinetic trials ranged from 7 to 24 participants, whereas the largest retrospective study of pregnancy rates still evaluated less than 800 total contraceptive users. Still, the incidence of such a rare interaction would not differ from the accepted normal failure rate of oral contraceptive therapy. The medico-legal ramifications of what looks like at best a rare interaction remains somewhat ""murky."" On one hand, we have medico-legal experts advising the profession to exercise caution and warn all oral contraceptive users of a potential reduction in efficacy during antibiotic therapy. These opinions are not evidence-based and rely heavily on one or two legal proceedings that cannot even be substantiated. On the other hand, there is one recently published legal proceeding in which the outcome was in favor of the oral surgeon. There is clearly a need for additional scientific research in oral contraceptive users that incorporates larger sample sizes, different time courses (prophylactic use versus standard 7-10 day use versus extended use), and different delivery systems (systemic administration versus local-controlled delivery) of antibiotic therapy. Though experts on this topic still recommend informing oral contraceptive users of the potential for a rare interaction, and for clinicians to advise them to employ additional barrier techniques of birth control during antibiotic therapy and for at least 1 week beyond the last dose [40], it is hoped that a set of guidelines regarding this controversy will eventually be published that is evidence-based, and not solely the results of anecdotal reports, expert opinions, and legal proceedings.","Studies show that the coadministration of antibiotics (ampicillin, tetracycline, doxycycline, metronidazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin, temafloxacin, fluconazole, ciprofloxacin, or ofloxacin) did not reduce serum levels of either the estrogen or progestin components of the oral contraceptives."
"Do antibiotics interfere with the efficacy of oral contraceptives
To evaluate the evidence on possible drug interactions between antibiotics and oral contraceptives (OCs) that may lead to OC failure. MEDLINE and Lexis/Nexis Medical Library searches for 1966-1999 using the key word ""oral contraceptives,"" cross-indexed with the terms ""antibiotics,"" ""adverse effects,"" and ""pregnancy,"" and MEDLINE search using the additional MeSH term ""drug interactions."" No language restrictions were used. A total of 167 articles were retrieved for analysis. Another 32 articles were identified by review of the references cited in these publications. Articles were selected based on their ability to provide information on the relationship between antibiotic therapy and OC efficacy in otherwise compliant users (defined as women with unplanned pregnancies who reported compliance with their OC regimen). Additionally, studies that either directly measured the effects of antibiotics on the pharmacokinetics of OC components, or that analyzed the effects of antibiotics on measures of ovulation in OC users were accepted. At least 30 cases have been reported of pregnancies occurring in women taking OCs and antibiotics, particularly rifampin. Approximately 20% of pregnant women reporting to family planning or abortion clinics reported concomitant OC and antibiotic use. Information from adverse event reporting databases generally mirrors the types of information gleaned from these case reports and clinical surveys and accounts for approximately one-third of reported cases. Retrospective surveys, primarily from dermatology-based practices, also have reported 24 pregnancies in OC users who concomitantly received therapy with antibiotics, most commonly tetracyclines and penicillins. Apparent OC failure rates in clinical surveys were within the usual range expected for patterns of typical use. In pooled results obtained from relatively small populations, oral antibiotics, with the exception of rifampin, have not significantly affected the pharmacokinetics of ethinyl estradiol, levonorgestrel, and norethindrone or reduced the serum concentrations of gonadotropins. However, individual patients have been identified who experienced significant decreases in the plasma concentration of these components of OCs and who appeared to ovulate. Rifampin impairs the effectiveness of OCs. Pharmacokinetic studies of other antibiotics have not shown any systematic interaction between antibiotics and OC steroids. However, individual patients do show large decreases in the plasma concentrations of ethinyl estradiol when they take certain other antibiotics, notably tetracycline and penicillin derivatives. Because it is not possible to identify these women in advance, a cautious approach is advised.","The women most likely to have pill failure are those with low rates of ethinyl estradiol hydroxylation, high rates of hepatic conjugation, low plasma concentrations of ethinyl estradiol, extensive intestinal hydrolysis of estrogen conjugates, or gut flora particularly susceptible to the antibiotic. Unfortunately, they cannot be identified by any routine diagnostic tests. The most conservative approach emphasizes patient education and additional forms of nonhormonal contraception for any woman on OCs during any antibiotic therapy and for at least 1 week after treatment."
"Should you treat a symptomatic patient by phone when his child has confirmed strep throat
Sore throat is a common complaint, and identifying patients with group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis (strep throat) is an important task for clinicians. Previous reviews have not systematically reviewed and synthesized the evidence. To review the precision and accuracy of the clinical examination in diagnosing strep throat. MEDLINE search for articles about diagnosis of strep throat using history-taking and physical examination. Large blinded, prospective studies (having > or =300 patients with sore throat) reporting history and physical examination data and using throat culture as the reference standard were included. Of 917 articles identified by the search, 9 met all inclusion criteria. Pairs of authors independently reviewed each article and used consensus to resolve discrepancies. The most useful findings for evaluating the likelihood of strep throat are presence of tonsillar exudate, pharyngeal exudate, or exposure to strep throat infection in the previous 2 weeks (positive likelihood ratios, 3.4, 2.1, and 1.9, respectively) and the absence of tender anterior cervical nodes, tonsillar enlargement, or exudate (negative likelihood ratios, 0.60, 0.63, and 0.74, respectively). No individual element of history-taking or physical examination is accurate enough by itself to rule in or rule out strep throat. Three validated clinical prediction rules are described for adult and pediatric populations. While no single element of history-taking or physical examination is sufficiently accurate to exclude or diagnose strep throat, a well-validated clinical prediction rule can be useful and can help physicians make more informed use of rapid antigen tests and throat cultures.","According to 1 meta-analysis, a history of exposure to strep in the previous 2 weeks had a sensitivity of 19%, with a specificity ranging from 87% to 94%. This results in a likelihood ratio (LR) of 1.9 if the patient has an exposure (eg, the patient's odds of having strep are 1.9 times higher than baseline), and a patient without an exposure has an LR of 0.94. (Typically, LRs of 0.5 to 2.0 are not helpful for diagnostic testing). In a population at a 10% risk of GABHS as the cause of pharyngitis, the positive predictive value of streptococcal exposure was 17%, and the negative predictive value of no known exposure was 91%."

"Which UTI therapies are safe and effective during breastfeeding
Quinolone-induced cartilage toxicity has been observed in experimental juvenile animal studies and is species- and dose-specific. Accordingly these findings have led to the contraindication of fluoroquinolones in children. Previous data in 634 adolescents and children treated with compassionate use ciprofloxacin demonstrated low rates of reversible arthralgia and a safety profile similar to that for adult patients. This report describes the safety findings in 1795 children who received 2030 treatment courses of intravenous or oral ciprofloxacin. The average doses of intravenous and oral ciprofloxacin in the study population were 8 and 25 mg/kg/day, respectively. Treatment-associated events were reported in 10.9% of children receiving oral ciprofloxacin compared with 18.9% among intravenous recipients. Overall arthralgia occurred during 31 ciprofloxacin treatment courses (1.5%) and the majority of events were of mild to moderate severity and resolved without intervention. More than 60% of arthralgia episodes were in children with cystic fibrosis. The adverse event pattern in children receiving ciprofloxacin in this analysis was similar to that observed in adults. Rates of reversible arthralgia were low and unchanged from previously published surveillance data in children.","A report was published summarizing safety data from the Bayer database of compassionate use of ciprofloxacin. The report indicates that 2030 treatment courses of ciprofloxacin were given to 1795 children up to age 17 for a variety of infections; only 3% were under age 5. Most patients received 21 to 40 mg/kg of ciprofloxacin per day; treatment duration was from 1 to 303 days. Arthralgia occurred in 1.5% of patients, most of whom had cystic fibrosis. Of the 31 patients affected, arthralgias resolved in 25, improved in 1, and remained unchanged in 1. (Data regarding resolution were unavailable for 4 patients.)"
"Does regular exercise reduce the pain and stiffness of osteoarthritis
To compare the efficacy of aerobic walking and home based quadriceps strengthening exercises in patients with knee osteoarthritis. The Medline, Pubmed, EMBASE, CINAHL, and PEDro databases and the Cochrane controlled trials register were searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of subjects with knee osteoarthritis comparing aerobic walking or home based quadriceps strengthening exercise with a non-exercise control group. Methodological quality of retrieved RCTs was assessed. Outcome data were abstracted for pain and self reported disability and the effect size calculated for each outcome. RCTs were grouped according to exercise mode and the data pooled using both fixed and random effects models. 35 RCTs were identified, 13 of which met inclusion criteria and provided data suitable for further analysis. Pooled effect sizes for pain were 0.52 for aerobic walking and 0.39 for quadriceps strengthening. For self reported disability, pooled effect sizes were 0.46 for aerobic walking and 0.32 for quadriceps strengthening. Both aerobic walking and home based quadriceps strengthening exercise reduce pain and disability from knee osteoarthritis but no difference between them was found on indirect comparison.","A 2005 systematic review examined aerobic walking and quadriceps strengthening for knee osteoarthritis using pain as the primary outcome and self-reported disability as the secondary outcome. In the exercise group, the weighted, pooled ES for pain reduction and self-reported disability was moderate at 0.52 (95% CI, 0.34-0.70) and 0.46 (95% CI, 0.25-0.67) respectively. The quadriceps strengthening group showed a small weighted, pooled ES for pain reduction of 0.32 (95% CI, 0.23-0.42) and disability of 0.32 (95% CI, 0.23-0.41); pain and disability measures were variable. None of the included clinical trials were blinded."
"What are effective treatments for oppositional defiant behaviors in adolescents
Conduct disorder is a common childhood psychiatric problem that has an increased incidence in adolescence. The primary diagnostic features of conduct disorder include aggression, theft, vandalism, violations of rules and/or lying. For a diagnosis, these behaviors must occur for at least a six-month period. Conduct disorder has a multifactorial etiology that includes biologic, psychosocial and familial factors. The differential diagnosis of conduct disorder includes oppositional defiant disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), mood disorder and intermittent explosive disorder. Family physicians may provide brief, behaviorally focused parent counseling, pharmacotherapy and referral for more intensive family and individual psychotherapy.",Experts say antidepressant medications may be helpful in treating children with conduct disorder and comorbid major depression.
"Does anticoagulation prevent thrombosis for persons with fractures distal to the hip
Deep-vein thrombosis is common after plaster-cast immobilisation for traumatic injury. We did a randomised prospective study of the effect of low-molecular-weight heparin on the incidence of deep-vein thrombosis in patients with minor injuries treated with plaster-cast immobilisation of the leg. A control group (n = 163) received no prophylaxis, the prophylaxis group received low-molecular-weight heparin once daily (n = 176). The incidence of deep-vein thrombosis in the prophylaxis group was 0% (one tailed p < 0.006) vs 4.3% in the control group. No severe side-effects of low-molecular-weight heparin were observed. Thromboprophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin once daily is effective in reducing the risk of deep-vein thrombosis in outpatients with plaster-cast immobilisation of the leg.","An RCT evaluated LMWH (Mono-Embolex, a European LMWH) prophylaxis in 328 outpatients with lower limb injuries, which included fractures, severe contusions, and ligamentous injuries. All were treated nonsurgically with cast immobilization (mean=18.8 days, range=2-72 days) and 176 patients used daily LMWH injections. All underwent Doppler evaluation for leg thromboses after cast removal, and positive results were confirmed with venograms. Overall, there were no DVTs among the LMWH prophylaxis group and 7 DVTs (4.3%) in the group without LMWH prophylaxis (P<.006). Among those with fractures, the untreated DVT rate was 5.9% (vs 0% with LMWH prophylaxis). Those over age 40 who did not use LMWH had a DVT rate of 11.4% (vs 1.7% in younger patients). Without LMWH prophylaxis, casting for more than 10 days approximately doubled the risk of DVT compared with less than 10 days (6.1% vs 3.1%). This study did not report on the anatomic location of DVTs or if they were clinically evident."
"What is the best treatment for gastroesophageal reflux and vomiting in infants
To assess the effect of thickening of feedings on gastroesophageal reflux and gastric emptying, 20 infants were examined with technetium scintigraphy and detailed behavioral observation after each of a pair of feedings, one with radiolabeled infant formula alone and the other with radiolabeled formula thickened with dry rice cereal. The thickened and unthickened meals were followed by similar amounts of scintigraphically demonstrated gastroesophageal reflux. However, the number of episodes of emesis (1.2 +/- 0.7 vs 3.9 +/- 0.9 per 90 minutes postprandial), the percent of gastric emptying at 30 minutes (17.8% +/- 2.7% vs 22.4% +/- 2.4%), the time spent crying (11.7 +/- 3.1 minutes vs 17.6 +/- 3.8 minutes per 90 minutes), and the total time spent awake (45.2 +/- 5.9 minutes vs 53.1 +/- 4.9 minutes per 90 minutes) were significantly less after the thickened feedings. Because thickening of infant feedings increases the caloric density, decreases emesis, decreases crying time, and increases sleep time in the postprandial period, it is likely to be beneficial in the treatment of infants with gastroesophageal reflux associated with failure to thrive.","In 1 RCT, formula thickened with rice cereal decreased emesis episodes."
"What is the best treatment for gastroesophageal reflux and vomiting in infants
To determine whether head-elevated prone positioning is better than flat prone positioning for infants with gastroesophageal reflux, we studied 100 babies less than 6 months of age who were being examined for reflux with an intraluminal esophageal pH probe while the babies were in each of the two positions, with the use of a crossover design protocol. During both a 2-hour postprandial period and a fasting period, pH probe measurements in each position included (1) minutes with pH less than 4, (2) number of episodes with pH less than 4, (3) mean duration of such episodes, (4) number of such episodes longer than 5 minutes, and (5) the duration of the longest episode. Significant reductions with head elevation were found for only two of these 10 values: the frequency of reflux episodes postprandially (7.5 +/- 0.7 vs 5.9 +/- 0.5 episodes per 2 hours; p less than 0.05) and the frequency of episodes longer than 5 minutes postprandially (1.4 +/- 0.1 vs 1.2 +/- 0.1 episodes per 2 hours; p less than 0.005). There was no significant reduction in the total duration of postprandial reflux nor in any measure of reflux during the fasting period. The 90 infants in whom an abnormal degree of gastroesophageal reflux was documented had no significant differences between flat prone and head-elevated prone position for any of the 10 pH probe measurements. Head-elevated prone positioning is probably not worth the extra effort required to maintain it.",Prone positioning is no longer recommended due to the risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).
"How does tissue adhesive compare with suturing for superficial lacerations
Octylcyanoacrylate is a medical grade topical tissue adhesive that has been approved for closing surgical incisions and traumatic lacerations. We reviewed animal and human studies that evaluated its use for a variety of surgical indications and specialties. We also performed a meta-analysis of all clinical trials using octylcyanoacrylate. Animal and human studies published in peer-reviewed articles as well as published abstracts. A search of Medline was performed using the MESH terms: tissue adhesives, cyanoacrylates, and octylcyanoacrylate. The current review and metanalysis demonstrate that octylcyanoacrylate can be used successfully in a wide variety of clinical and surgical settings for multiple types of wounds covering most of the surface of the human body. Prior knowledge of the limitations and technical aspects specific to wound closure with octylcyanoacrylate as well as appropriate wound selection and preparation will help ensure optimal results.",Pain outcomes in the studies showed that closure with tissue adhesive was less painful due to the lack of a need for anesthesia.
"How should you document a patient's refusal to undergo a necessary intervention
Clearly, a multitude of potential consent problems can exist for the emergency physician. It is difficult at times to balance the concepts of patient autonomy with the desire to provide optimal medical care. Experienced emergency physicians should be able to individualize the type of consent needed in a particular situation, based on a clinical evaluation of the case. Some general principles apply, but no strict rules can guide the physician in every case. Documentation of consent and refusal of treatment are critical for quality of patient care and legal liability reasons. Principles of what is good, ""appropriate"" legal consent usually follow from good medical care and strict concern for the patient's health and rights.","In addition to the discussion with the patient, the medical record should describe any involvement of family or other third parties. If imminently or potentially serious consequences are likely to result from patient refusal, health care providers might consider having the refusal signed and witnessed."
"Are steroid injections effective for tenosynovitis of the hand
Ninety-five patients with 107 trigger digits were divided into 2 groups and studied prospectively to evaluate steroid injection placement and efficacy. In 1 group, an attempt was made to deliver 1 injection into the tendon sheath at the A1 pulley. In the other group, 1 injection infiltrated the subcutaneous tissues overlying the A1 pulley. Radiopaque dye provided contrast to the injection medium, and postinjection x-rays identified the true delivery site of the steroid solution. Of the 52 digits into which intrasheath injection was attempted, 19 digits (37%) received all the injection within the sheath, 24 (46%) received medication into both the sheath and the subcutaneous tissues, and 9 (17%) received no medication within the tendon sheath. The results were analyzed to determine whether injection placement influences the efficacy of steroid injection. The confirmed all-sheath injection group exhibited a 47% good response, the mixed sheath and subcutaneous group had a 50% good response, and the all-subcutaneous group had a 70% good response. The results of this study suggest that true intrasheath injection offers no apparent advantage over subcutaneous injection in the treatment of trigger digits.","In a prospective, uncontrolled trial, 107 patients with flexor tenosynovitis were injected with 1 cc of betamethasone, 0.5 cc of 1% lidocaine, and 0.5 cc of radio opaque dye. Some patients got their injections in the tendon sheath at the A1 pulley site, others got their injections in the subcutaneous tissue surrounding the pulley, and a third group got injections in both sites. Patients graded their relief subjectively as either good (total alleviation of symptoms), fair (lasting improvement), or poor (only transient improvement or none at all). Those who received an intrasheath injection reported good results 47% of the time at 2 weeks follow-up, compared with 70% and 50% for patients in the subcutaneous and mixed groups, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference between the groups, suggesting that the exact location of injection may not be important."
"Are steroid injections effective for tenosynovitis of the hand
There have been many approaches described to treat de Quervain's tenosynovitis, but no definite consensus emerges in the literature. We conducted a pooled quantitative literature evaluation to review the therapeutic studies in the English language to determine the various reported cure rates. All citations in the MEDLINE and Ovid databases that addressed de Quervain's tenosynovitis were independently reviewed. Appropriate studies from the bibliographies of these articles were then obtained. Of the 35 articles on de Quervain's temosynovitis that were found in the modern literature, only seven allowed for comparison among potentially effective treatments. Studies were included if they evaluated or compared treatment options among patients and had defined criteria for diagnosis and successful treatment. These seven studies were descriptive, not comparative. In other words, each study reported the proportion of successful outcomes with different treatments, without a comparison to a specified control group. Four hundred fifty-nine wrists were subjected to one of several therapeutic modalities. There was an 83% cure rate with injection alone. This rate was much higher than any other therapeutic modality (61% for injection and splint, 14% for splint alone, 0% for rest or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs). It seems that injection alone is the best therapeutic approach to de Quervain's tenosynovitis.","A pooled quantitative literature search concerning the treatment of de Quervain's tenosynovitis compared 7 studies (a total of 459 wrists) with identical diagnostic and success criteria. Average follow-up was 9.6 months (range, 1 week to 7 years). There were no control groups in the studies, and none of the studies were randomized. Of the 226 cases treated with steroid injection alone, 83% were cured, though 30 of these needed a second injection. Sixty-one percent of those treated with injection and splint were cured, while 14% treated with splint alone reported cure."
"What is the risk of bowel strangulation in an adult with an untreated inguinal hernia
Emergency hernia repairs comprise one of the most common procedures performed in elderly patients and also carry a high risk of mortality and morbidity. The aim of this study was to examine the factors that might have an influence on the outcome of emergency hernia repairs in elderly patients. A review was made of 189 (120 male and 69 female) patients aged more than 65 years who underwent emergency hernia repair between December 1996 and January 2001 at the surgical emergency unit of our hospital. The patients' ages ranged from 65 to 100 years (mean 72.1). Concomitant diseases were present in 86 (45.5%) patients. Of 189 incarcerated hernias, there were 145 (76.7%) bowel obstructions and 91(48%) strangulations. Necrotic bowel was resected in 36(19%) patients. While overall mortality was 5%, it was found to be 19.4% after bowel resection. Major complications were observed in 48 (25%) patients. Mortality and morbidity were clearly linked with bowel resection. Coexisting cardiopulmonary diseases, misdiagnosis, American Society of Anesthesiologists class, and late admission were also found to be responsible for unfavorable outcomes. In elderly patients with external hernias early elective surgery should be preferred, and local anesthesia might be the best in order to avoid the increased risks of emergency hernia repairs.","A Turkish study of patients needing emergent surgical repair found morbidity to be significantly related to American society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class, with mortality rates of 3% and 14% for ASA class III and IV patients, respectively. This was a retrospective chart review that analyzed factors responsible for unfavorable outcomes; it found increased complications in hernia patients who had coexisting disease, hernias of longer duration, as well as higher ASA class. This study found the need for emergent repair peaked for patients 70 to 80 years of age."
"What is the risk of bowel strangulation in an adult with an untreated inguinal hernia
It is generally accepted that most inguinal hernias should be operated on electively in order to avoid the high morbidity and mortality associated with incarceration and small bowel obstruction. The present study reassesses the indication for surgery in asymptomatic inguinal hernia patients. We analyzed profiles, separately, for elective and emergency inguinal herniorrhaphies and compared the morbidity and mortality rates. Two hundred randomly selected elective hernia repairs were compared with 67 incarcerated cases. Postoperative complications were more common following emergency (23.9%) than elective repair (10.5%); however, in both groups, minor complications predominated. The mortality rate in the incarcerated group (6%) was clearly linked with a high preoperative American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score. A bowel resection rate of 4.5% was found in the incarcerated cases, which was not correlated with mortality. Patients with asymptomatic inguinal hernia and unfavorable medical conditions should be recommended an elective repair, preferably under local anesthesia, to avoid the high mortality associated with an emergency operation.","A retrospective study from Israel also showed that patients who underwent emergency repair were older, had a longer history of herniation than those undergoing elective repair, and had higher ASA scores."
"What does the evidence tell us about treating very-high-risk patients to an LDL <70 mg/dL
This study sought to determine whether statins reduce coronary heart disease (CHD) risk more than other interventions that also primarily lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Statins have anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, antithrombotic, vascular, and other non-LDL-C-lowering effects. It is unclear whether these pleiotropic effects contribute to cardiovascular risk reduction beyond that expected from LDL-C reduction alone. Trials published in English language journals were retrieved by searching Medline (1966 to October 2004), bibliographies, and the author's reference files. Randomized, placebo-controlled trials of interventions to primarily lower LDL-C of three or more years' duration in which clinical disease or death were primary outcomes were used. Information on sample size, treatment type and duration, participant characteristics at baseline, reduction in lipids, and outcome was independently abstracted by two authors (J.R. and N.M.) using a standardized protocol. Data from 5 diet, 3 bile acid sequestrant, 1 surgery, and 10 statin trials, with 81,859 participants, were included in the CHD meta-regression analysis. The regression lines for non-statin and statin trials were similar and consistent with a one-to-one relationship between LDL-C lowering and CHD and stroke reduction over five years of treatment. The pleiotropic effects of statins do not seem to contribute an additional cardiovascular risk reduction benefit beyond that expected from the degree of LDL-C lowering observed in other trials that primarily lowered LDL-C.","A 19-trial meta-regression analysis (81,859 patients with stable CHD) demonstrated that each 1% reduction in LDL cholesterol corresponded to a 1% decrease in risk for CHD. This result held true regardless of different approaches to treatment, which included diet, bile-acid sequestrant, statins, or ileal bypass surgery."
"What does the evidence tell us about treating very-high-risk patients to an LDL <70 mg/dL
Throughout the usual LDL cholesterol range in Western populations, lower blood concentrations are associated with lower cardiovascular disease risk. In such populations, therefore, reducing LDL cholesterol may reduce the development of vascular disease, largely irrespective of initial cholesterol concentrations. 20,536 UK adults (aged 40-80 years) with coronary disease, other occlusive arterial disease, or diabetes were randomly allocated to receive 40 mg simvastatin daily (average compliance: 85%) or matching placebo (average non-study statin use: 17%). Analyses are of the first occurrence of particular events, and compare all simvastatin-allocated versus all placebo-allocated participants. These ""intention-to-treat"" comparisons assess the effects of about two-thirds (85% minus 17%) taking a statin during the scheduled 5-year treatment period, which yielded an average difference in LDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L (about two-thirds of the effect of actual use of 40 mg simvastatin daily). Primary outcomes were mortality (for overall analyses) and fatal or non-fatal vascular events (for subcategory analyses), with subsidiary assessments of cancer and of other major morbidity. All-cause mortality was significantly reduced (1328 [12.9%] deaths among 10,269 allocated simvastatin versus 1507 [14.7%] among 10,267 allocated placebo; p=0.0003), due to a highly significant 18% (SE 5) proportional reduction in the coronary death rate (587 [5.7%] vs 707 [6.9%]; p=0.0005), a marginally significant reduction in other vascular deaths (194 [1.9%] vs 230 [2.2%]; p=0.07), and a non-significant reduction in non-vascular deaths (547 [5.3%] vs 570 [5.6%]; p=0.4). There were highly significant reductions of about one-quarter in the first event rate for non-fatal myocardial infarction or coronary death (898 [8.7%] vs 1212 [11.8%]; p<0.0001), for non-fatal or fatal stroke (444 [4.3%] vs 585 [5.7%]; p<0.0001), and for coronary or non-coronary revascularisation (939 [9.1%] vs 1205 [11.7%]; p<0.0001). For the first occurrence of any of these major vascular events, there was a definite 24% (SE 3; 95% CI 19-28) reduction in the event rate (2033 [19.8%] vs 2585 [25.2%] affected individuals; p<0.0001). During the first year the reduction in major vascular events was not significant, but subsequently it was highly significant during each separate year. The proportional reduction in the event rate was similar (and significant) in each subcategory of participant studied, including: those without diagnosed coronary disease who had cerebrovascular disease, or had peripheral artery disease, or had diabetes; men and, separately, women; those aged either under or over 70 years at entry; and--most notably--even those who presented with LDL cholesterol below 3.0 mmol/L (116 mg/dL), or total cholesterol below 5.0 mmol/L (193 mg/dL). The benefits of simvastatin were additional to those of other cardioprotective treatments. The annual excess risk of myopathy with this regimen was about 0.01%. There were no significant adverse effects on cancer incidence or on hospitalisation for any other non-vascular cause. Adding simvastatin to existing treatments safely produces substantial additional benefits for a wide range of high-risk patients, irrespective of their initial cholesterol concentrations. Allocation to 40 mg simvastatin daily reduced the rates of myocardial infarction, of stroke, and of revascularisation by about one-quarter. After making allowance for non-compliance, actual use of this regimen would probably reduce these rates by about one-third. Hence, among the many types of high-risk individual studied, 5 years of simvastatin would prevent about 70-100 people per 1000 from suffering at least one of these major vascular events (and longer treatment should produce further benefit). The size of the 5-year benefit depends chiefly on such individuals' overall risk of major vascular events, rather than on their blood lipid concentrations alone.","In the Heart Protection Study, patients with CHD, other occlusive arterial disease, or diabetes were randomized to 40 mg simvastatin or placebo. Simvastatin reduced relative risk of CHD-regardless of baseline LDL-even in patients with a baseline LDL <116 mg/dL. Further analysis showed that among the many types of high-risk patients, 5 years of simvastatin at 40 mg daily would prevent about 70 to 100 people in 1000 from suffering at least 1 major vascular event (myocardial infarction, stroke, or the need for revascularization). Interestingly, patients with relatively smaller reductions in LDL (those in the lowest third) showed the same decrease in CHD events as patients in the highest third-although the overall difference in LDL wasn't large."
"Which strategies work best to prevent obesity in adults
Behavioral weight loss interventions achieve short-term success, but re-gain is common. To compare 2 weight loss maintenance interventions with a self-directed control group. Two-phase trial in which 1032 overweight or obese adults (38% African American, 63% women) with hypertension, dyslipidemia, or both who had lost at least 4 kg during a 6-month weight loss program (phase 1) were randomized to a weight-loss maintenance intervention (phase 2). Enrollment at 4 academic centers occurred August 2003-July 2004 and randomization, February-December 2004. Data collection was completed in June 2007. After the phase 1 weight-loss program, participants were randomized to one of the following groups for 30 months: monthly personal contact, unlimited access to an interactive technology-based intervention, or self-directed control. Main Outcome Changes in weight from randomization. Mean entry weight was 96.7 kg. During the initial 6-month program, mean weight loss was 8.5 kg. After randomization, weight regain occurred. Participants in the personal-contact group regained less weight (4.0 kg) than those in the self-directed group (5.5 kg; mean difference at 30 months, -1.5 kg; 95% confidence interval [CI], -2.4 to -0.6 kg; P = .001). At 30 months, weight regain did not differ between the interactive technology-based (5.2 kg) and self-directed groups (5.5 kg; mean difference -0.3 kg; 95% CI, -1.2 to 0.6 kg; P = .51); however, weight regain was lower in the interactive technology-based than in the self-directed group at 18 months (mean difference, -1.1 kg; 95% CI, -1.9 to -0.4 kg; P = .003) and at 24 months (mean difference, -0.9 kg; 95% CI, -1.7 to -0.02 kg; P = .04). At 30 months, the difference between the personal-contact and interactive technology-based group was -1.2 kg (95% CI -2.1 to -0.3; P = .008). Effects did not differ significantly by sex, race, age, and body mass index subgroups. Overall, 71% of study participants remained below entry weight. The majority of individuals who successfully completed an initial behavioral weight loss program maintained a weight below their initial level. Monthly brief personal contact provided modest benefit in sustaining weight loss, whereas an interactive technology-based intervention provided early but transient benefit. clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00054925.","In a study, 1032 overweight or obese adults with hypertension and/or dyslipidemia who completed a weight-loss program were randomly assigned to receive monthly personal contact, unlimited access to a Web-based intervention, or a self-directed control group.

"Are overweight children more likely to be overweight adults
Overweight and obesity in youth are important public health concerns and are of particular interest because of possible long-term associations with adult weight status and morbidity. The aim of this study was to systematically review the literature and update evidence concerning persistence of childhood overweight. A computerized bibliographical search--restricted to studies with a prospective or retrospective longitudinal design--was conducted. Two authors independently extracted data and assessed the methodological quality of the included studies in four dimensions (i) study population and participation rate; (ii) study attrition; (iii) data collection and (iv) data analysis. Conclusions were based on a rating system of three levels of evidence. A total of 25 publications were selected for inclusion in this review. According to a methodological quality assessment, 13 studies were considered to be of high quality. The majority of these high-quality studies were published after 2001, indicating that recently published data, in particular, provide us with reliable information. All included studies consistently report an increased risk of overweight and obese youth becoming overweight adults, suggesting that the likelihood of persistence of overweight into adulthood is moderate for overweight and obese youth. However, predictive values varied considerably. Limiting aspects with respect to generalizability and methodological issues are discussed.","A 2008 systematic review found 25 prospective or retrospective longitudinal studies that examined the risk of overweight in adulthood based on overweight in childhood or adolescence. Studies had to include at least 1 anthropomorphic measurement before age 18 and at least 1 after age 18. The informativeness and validity of the studies were assessed using a standard evaluation tool. Because the review sought to provide results that could be generalized to large populations, it didn't include studies of specific populations, such as former premature infants. All of the 13 studies judged to be high quality found an elevated RR or odds ratio (OR) for adult obesity among participants who had been overweight as children. The authors didn't calculate a composite measure of effect, but RRs in the individual studies ranged from 1.9 to 10.1. The systematic review considered children (≤12 years) and adolescents (>12 years) separately. Four high-quality studies assessed how many overweight children became overweight adults; 2 high-quality studies examined how many overweight children became obese adults. Overweight children had RRs between 1.9 and 3.6 for being overweight in adulthood compared with average-weight children; 1 study reported an OR of 7.0. One study showed older overweight children to be at greater risk than younger children for overweight in adulthood: children who were overweight at 2 years of age had an RR of 2.7, whereas children who were overweight at 11 years had an RR of 3.6. Obese children had similar results. A study of 4 age cohorts showed that children who were obese at 1 or 2 years of age had an OR of 1.3 for obesity in adulthood compared with average-weight peers. Obese children in the 3- to 5-year-old cohort had an OR of 4.7; obese children in the 6- to 9-year-old cohort had an OR of 8.8; and obese 10- to 14-year-olds had an OR of 22.3. As with children, overweight adolescents had a higher risk of being overweight in adulthood. And the association between older age and higher ORs persisted into adolescence. One study found an OR of 17.5 for adult overweight among youngsters who were overweight at 10 to 14 years of age and an OR of 22.3 for adolescents who were overweight at 15 to 17 years. The systematic review also revealed sex differences. Two studies showed that overweight or obese boys were not only more likely to be overweight in adulthood than their average-weight peers (OR=15.0 in 1 study; RR=9.8 in the other), but also more likely to be overweight later in life than overweight or obese girls. The girls had an OR of 12.0 for adult overweight in 1 study and an RR of 6.8 in the other."
"How useful is a physical exam in diagnosing testicular torsion
The correlation between the presence of the ipsilateral cremasteric reflex and the absence of testicular torsion was 100 per cent in a 7-year evaluation of 245 boys with acute scrotal swelling. The presence of the cremasteric reflex was the most valuable clinical finding in ruling out testicular torsion and the absence of this reflex increased the suspicion of testis torsion.","A consecutive case series evaluated 245 boys, newborn to 18 years of age, with acute scrotal swelling. None of the 125 subjects who had an intact cremasteric reflex had ipsilateral testicular torsion. The cremasteric reflex was absent in all 56 subjects with testicular torsion. An absent cremasteric reflex in boys with acute scrotal swelling had a sensitivity of 100% (95% confidence interval [CI], 91%-100%), a specificity of 66% (95% CI, 59%-72%), and a likelihood ratio of a negative test (presence of a cremasteric reflex) of 0.01 (95% CI, 0.001-0.21)."
"How useful is a physical exam in diagnosing testicular torsion
To compare historical features, physical examination findings, and testicular color Doppler ultrasound in pediatric patients with epididymitis, testicular torsion, and torsion of appendix testis. A retrospective review of patients with the diagnosis of epididymitis, testicular torsion, or torsion of appendix testis. Ninety patients were included in the study (64 with epididymitis, 13 with testicular torsion, and 13 with torsion of appendix testis). Historical features did not differ among groups except for duration of symptoms. Of 13 patients with testicular torsion all had a tender testicle and an absent cremasteric reflex. When compared with the testicular torsion group, fewer patients with epididymitis had a tender testicle (69%) or an absent cremasteric reflex (14%). 62 (97%) patients with epididymitis had a tender epididymis and 43 (67%) had scrotal erythema/edema. By comparison, 3 (23%) and 5 (38%) patients with testicular torsion had a tender epididymis or scrotal erythema/edema, respectively. Doppler ultrasound showed decreased or absent blood flow in 8 patients, 7 of whom were diagnosed with testicular torsion. Ten out of 13 patients with testicular torsion had a salvageable testicle at the time of surgery. The physical examination is helpful in distinguishing among epididymitis, testicular torsion, and torsion of appendix testis. Patients presenting with a tender testicle and an absent cremasteric reflex were more likely to have a testicular torsion rather than epididymitis or torsion of appendix testis. An absent cremasteric reflex was the most sensitive physical finding for diagnosing testicular torsion. Color Doppler ultrasound is a useful adjunct in the evaluation of the acute scrotum when physical findings are equivocal.","Tender epididymitis: 23% sensitivity, 20% specificity. Isolated tenderness: 4% sensitivity, 83% specificity."
"What treatments prevent miscarriage after recurrent pregnancy loss
Immunologic aberrations might be the cause of recurrent early pregnancy loss in some women. The objective of this review was to assess the effects of leukocyte immunisation or other immunologic treatments such as intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) on the live birth rate in women with previous unexplained recurrent miscarriages. The Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group trials register was searched (September 2002). Individual patient data were obtained from the American Society for Reproductive Immunology. Randomised trials of immunotherapy in women with three or more prior miscarriages and no more than one live birth; all recognised non-immunologic causes ruled out and no simultaneous treatment intervention. Eligibility and trial quality were assessed by one reviewer. Nineteen trials of high quality were included. The various forms of immunotherapy did not show significant differences between treatment and control groups in terms of subsequent live births: paternal cell immunisation (11 trials, 596 women), odds ratio (OR) 1.05, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.75 to 1.47; third party donor cell immunization (3 trials, 156 women), OR 1.39, 95% CI 0.68 to 2.82; trophoblast membrane infusion (1 trial, 37 women), OR 0.40, 95% CI 0.11 to 1.45; intravenous immune globulin (IVIG), OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.58. Paternal cell immunization, third party donor leukocytes, trophoblast membranes, and intravenous immune globulin provide no significant beneficial effect over placebo in preventing further miscarriages.","A systematic review of 22 RCTs evaluating 4 different types of immunotherapy for recurrent miscarriage found no significant improvement in live birth rates.

"What treatments prevent miscarriage after recurrent pregnancy loss
Alloimmunization as a treatment for recurrent spontaneous abortion (RSA) is still controversial due to the lack of enough controls to evaluate its effectiveness. The present study was conducted to compare the live birth rate in the presence or absence of immunotherapy. Ninety-two women with RSA (79 primary [PA] and 13 secondary aborters[SA]) received immunotherapy. Thirty-seven RSA couples not receiving paternal alloimmunization, constituted the ""control"" group. The pregnancy rate in alloimmunized was 58 vs 46% in the control group. The live birth increased from 71% in the controls to 88% after immunotherapy. The alloimmunization induced mixed lymphocyte reaction blocking factors (MLR BFs) in 79% of women. However, they were also present in 83% of immunized women experiencing a new abortion. These results indicate that alloimmunization may be useful in the treatment of RSA.","An RCT comparing PLI with placebo among 79 women with primary RSA of unknown cause again found no significant difference in live birth rates (89% vs 71%, respectively)."
"How should we follow athletes after a concussion
Lack of empirical data on recovery time following sport-related concussion hampers clinical decision making about return to play after injury. To prospectively measure immediate effects and natural recovery course relating to symptoms, cognitive functioning, and postural stability following sport-related concussion. Prospective cohort study of 1631 football players from 15 US colleges. All players underwent preseason baseline testing on concussion assessment measures in 1999, 2000, and 2001. Ninety-four players with concussion (based on American Academy of Neurology criteria) and 56 noninjured controls underwent assessment of symptoms, cognitive functioning, and postural stability immediately, 3 hours, and 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and 90 days after injury. Scores on the Graded Symptom Checklist (GSC), Standardized Assessment of Concussion (SAC), Balance Error Scoring System (BESS), and a neuropsychological test battery. No player with concussion was excluded from participation; 79 players with concussion (84%) completed the protocol through day 90. Players with concussion exhibited more severe symptoms (mean GSC score 20.93 [95% confidence interval [CI], 15.65-26.21] points higher than that of controls), cognitive impairment (mean SAC score 2.94 [95% CI, 1.50-4.38] points lower than that of controls), and balance problems (mean BESS score 5.81 [95% CI, -0.67 to 12.30] points higher than that of controls) immediately after concussion. On average, symptoms gradually resolved by day 7 (GSC mean difference, 0.33; 95% CI, -1.41 to 2.06), cognitive functioning improved to baseline levels within 5 to 7 days (day 7 SAC mean difference, -0.03; 95% CI, -1.33 to 1.26), and balance deficits dissipated within 3 to 5 days after injury (day 5 BESS mean difference, -0.31; 95% CI, -3.02 to 2.40). Mild impairments in cognitive processing and verbal memory evident on neuropsychological testing 2 days after concussion resolved by day 7. There were no significant differences in symptoms or functional impairments in the concussion and control groups 90 days after concussion. Collegiate football players may require several days for recovery of symptoms, cognitive dysfunction, and postural instability after concussion. Further research is required to determine factors that predict variability in recovery time after concussion. Standardized measurement of postconcussive symptoms, cognitive functioning, and postural stability may enhance clinical management of athletes recovering from concussion.","Sport concussion assessments should include testing for cognition, postural stability, and self-reported symptoms. Results can then be compared with each individual's preseason baseline. Examples of screening instruments include SCAT (the Sideline Concussion Assessment Tool), SAC (the Standardized Assessment of Concussion), BESS (the Balance Error Scoring System), as well as ImPACT or other neurocognitive tests, to evaluate and document memory, brain processing speed, reaction time, and postconcussive symptoms."
"What is the best treatment for nocturnal enuresis in children
Enuresis (bedwetting) is a socially disruptive and stressful condition which affects around 15-20% of five year olds, and up to 2% of young adults. To assess the effects of desmopressin on nocturnal enuresis in children, and to compare desmopressin with other interventions. We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group trials register. Date of the most recent search: March 2002. The reference list of a previous version of this review was also searched. All randomised trials of desmopressin for nocturnal enuresis in children were included in the review. Comparison interventions included placebo, other drugs, alarms or behavioural methods. Trials focused solely on daytime wetting were excluded. Two reviewers independently assessed the quality of the eligible trials, and extracted data. Forty one randomised trials involving 2760 children (of whom 1813 received desmopressin) met the inclusion criteria. The quality of many of the trials was poor. Desmopressin was compared with another drug in four trials, and with alarms in seven. Desmopressin was effective in reducing bedwetting in a variety of doses and forms. Each dose of desmopressin reduced bedwetting by at least one night per week during treatment compared with placebo (e.g. 20 microg: 1.34 fewer wet nights per week, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.57). Children on desmopressin were more likely to become dry (e.g. RR for failure to achieve 14 dry nights with 20 mcg 0.84, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.91). However, there was no difference after treatment was finished. There was no clear dose-related effect of desmopressin, but the evidence was limited. Data which compared oral and nasal administration were too few to be conclusive. While desmopressin was better than diclofenac or indomethacin, and comparison with tricyclic drugs (amitriptyline and imipramine) suggested that they might be as effective as desmopressin, the data were inconclusive due to small numbers. There were more side effects with the tricyclics. In one small trial, desmopressin resulted in more wet nights than alarms towards the end of treatment (WMD 1.4, 95% CI: 0.14 to 2.66) and the chance of failure or relapse after alarms was less (RR 9.17, 95% CI 1.28 to 65.90). Although there were fewer wet nights during alarm treatment supplemented by desmopressin compared with alarms alone (WMD -1.35, 95% CI -2.32 to -0.38), the data are inconclusive about whether this is reflected in lower failure (RR 0.88, 95%CI 0.52 to 1.50) or subsequent relapse rates (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.10). Desmopressin rapidly reduced the number of wet nights per week, but there was some evidence that this was not sustained after treatment stopped. Comparison with alternative treatments suggested that desmopressin and tricyclics had similar clinical effects, but that alarms may produce more sustained benefits. However, based on the available limited evidence, these conclusions can only be tentative. Children should be advised not to drink more than 240 ml (8 oz) fluid during desmopressin treatment in order to avoid the possible risk of water intoxication.","A meta-analysis also showed that desmopressin (10-60 µg) at bedtime reduced bedwetting by 1 to 2 nights per week compared with placebo (WMD=1.34; 95% CI, -1.57 to -1.11 with a dose of 20 µg). The NNT to achieve 14 consecutive dry nights is 7. However, the data suggest once treatment stops, there is little difference between desmopressin and placebo. This combination treatment did not show a benefit with failure rates (not attaining 14 consecutive dry nights) or a statistically significant difference in failure and relapse rates once treatment stopped."
"What is the best way to treat tinea cruris
Miconazole nitrate (2.0%) cream was evaluated in the treatment of endemic dermatophytosis in an overcrowded prison. The active drug was compared in a random double-blind study with its control vehicle in the treatment of 99 inmates who had moderate to severe symptomatic disease. Tinea cruris and tinea pedis caused by Trichophyton rubrum predominated, although Trichophyton mentagrophytes and Candida albicans were also isolated and identified. Prompt clinical clearing occurred in 75.5% of those treated with miconazole versus 12.0% of those treated with the vehicle alone. Results of mycological examination closely paralleled and confirmed these clinical results.","Miconazole 2% cream (Micatin, Monistat) (used twice daily for 2 weeks by inmates in a Florida prison) demonstrated 75.5% clinical clearing (against tinea cruris, pedis, or corporis, or Candida cutaneous infections) when compared with placebo (NNT=1.57). Of the 99 patients evaluated, 48 were diagnosed with tinea cruris; however, results were not broken down into diagnostic category. The length of follow-up for these patients was not disclosed."
"Are oral agents effective for the treatment of verruca vulgaris
Viral warts are common dermatological diseases; although the rate of spontaneous recovery is high, it usually takes a long time, and some patients might not show this spontaneous healing. Zinc has an important effect on the immune system and it has been used as an immunomodulator to treat a variety of skin disorders. To assess whether oral zinc was effective in treating viral warts of patients evaluated between May 1999 and April 2000. This was a placebo-controlled clinical trial. Eighty patients with viral warts (common, plantar and plane) were all resistant to all forms of treatment. Each patient had > 15 warts. Forty patients were treated by oral zinc sulphate at a dose of 10 mg kg(-1) daily up to 600 mg day(-1) and followed-up for resolution of their warts and for any evidence of recurrence for 2-6 months. Another 40 patients were given a placebo oral treatment in the form of glucose, and followed-up for the same period. Only 23 patients of the first group (zinc treated) and 20 patients of the second group (placebo treated) completed the study. In all patients the serum level of zinc was low. In the zinc-treated group, the overall response was complete clearance of warts observed in 20 patients (86.9%) after 2 months of treatment. Fourteen patients (60.9%) showed complete disappearance of their warts after 1 month. Three patients (13.3%) failed to respond to the treatment after 2 months of therapy. The response to treatment was directly related to the increment in serum zinc level. No patient of the placebo-treated group showed any response. We conclude that zinc sulphate at a dose of 10 mg kg(-1) daily seems to be a highly efficacious therapeutic option for recalcitrant viral warts and proved to be safe with few adverse effects.","Zinc is the only agent to demonstrate efficacy in a completely randomized and placebo-controlled study. However, this trial was unblinded, had only 40 subjects assigned to each agent, had a dropout rate of 46%, and did not follow intention-to-treat analysis."
"What is the best way to diagnose polycystic ovarian syndrome
To assess the frequency of abnormal values for hormone measurements commonly used in the biochemical diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Hormone measurements in 63 unselected women with clinical and ultrasound diagnosis of PCOS attending gynaecological and general endocrine clinics in a District General Hospital were compared with those from a group of 20 normal ovulatory controls in the early follicular phase of their cycles. Serum levels of luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), LH/FSH ratio, total testosterone, derived free testosterone, sex hormone binding globulin, androstenedione, and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) were measured by radioimmunoassays. LH and FSH measured by two different assays. The mean serum LH and LH/FSH ratio were significantly (P less than 0.01) higher in the women with PCOS compared with the normal group, but these two measurements were in the abnormal range for only 35% and 41-44%, respectively. Absolute gonadotrophin values were significantly different using the two assay methods, which employed the same reference preparation as standard. Mean serum total testosterone concentration was significantly higher in the PCOS group and was the most frequently (70%) abnormal biochemical marker for PCOS. Sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) did not differ significantly between the two groups but showed a negative correlation with body mass index in women with PCOS. The combination of SHBG and testosterone to derive a free testosterone value did not further aid the biochemical diagnosis of PCOS. Androstenedione was significantly higher in the PCOS group than in the control group, with a frequency of 53%. There was no significant difference in DHEA-S between the two groups. When typical ovarian ultrasound appearances plus the clinical features of oligomenorrhea and/or hirsuitism were used to define PCOS total testosterone was the best single hormonal marker of the condition. Testosterone, androstenedione or LH, either alone or in combination, were raised in 86% of women with PCOS and these should be the definitive hormonal tests. Using LH/FSH ratio as a biochemical criterion for diagnosis of PCOS should be abandoned because of its low sensitivity. To be of value the normal range for all hormones should be precisely defined in a group of regularly ovulating women in the early follicular phase of the cycle for the assay used in each laboratory.","Evidence for hyperandrogenism includes hirsutism, acne, or elevated total testosterone levels."
"What is the best way to diagnose polycystic ovarian syndrome
NIDDM occurs commonly among women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). The prevalence and natural history of its precursor, impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), is less well known. The objective of this study was to characterize the prevalence and incidence of glucose intolerance in a large cohort of women with well-characterized PCOS. A total of 122 women with clinical and hormonal evidence of PCOS were recruited from the Medicine, Endocrinology, Gynecology, and Pediatrics Clinics at the University of Chicago. All women had a standard oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) with measurement of glucose and insulin levels. A subset of 25 women were subsequently restudied with the aim of characterizing the natural history of glucose tolerance in PCOS. Glucose tolerance was abnormal in 55 (45%) of the 122 women: 43 (35%) had IGT and 12 (10%) had NIDDM at the time of initial study. The women with NIDDM differed from those with normal glucose tolerance in that they had a 2.6-fold higher prevalence of first-degree relatives with NIDDM (83 vs. 31%, P < 0.01 by chi 2) and were significantly more obese (BMI 41.0 +/- 2.4 vs. 33.4 +/- 1.1 kg/m2, P < 0.01). For the entire cohort of 122 women, there was a significant correlation between fasting and 2-h glucose concentrations (r = 0.76, P < 0.0001); among the subset with IGT, the fasting glucose concentration was poorly predictive of the 2-h level (r = 0.25, NS). After a mean follow-up of 2.4 +/- 0.3 years (range 0.5-6.3), 25 women had a second OGTT. The glucose concentration at 2 h during the second glucose tolerance test was significantly higher than the 2-h concentration during the first study (161 +/- 9 vs. 139 +/- 6 mg/dl, P < 0.02). The prevalence of IGT and NIDDM in women with PCOS is substantially higher than expected when compared with age- and weight-matched populations of women without PCOS. The conversion from IGT to NIDDM is accelerated in PCOS. The fasting glucose concentration does not reliably predict the glucose concentration at 2 h after an oral glucose challenge, particularly among those with IGT, the subgroup at highest risk for subsequent development of NIDDM. We conclude that women with PCOS should periodically have an OGTT and must be closely monitored for deterioration in glucose tolerance.","Women with PCOS often experience insulin resistance, and are at increased risk for developing type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, and cardiovascular disease. One cross-sectional study of 122 women with PCOS between 13.5 and 40 years of age found that 35% had impaired glucose tolerance, and another 10% had non-insulindependent diabetes."
"Do topical antibiotics improve wound healing
To assess the effect of white petrolatum vs bacitracin ointment on wound infection incidence, allergic contact dermatitis incidence, and healing characteristics. Randomized, double-blind, prospective trial comparing white petrolatum with bacitracin ointment in postprocedure wound care.

A total of 922 patients who had dermatologic surgery with a total of 1249 wounds. The incidence of infection and allergic contact dermatitis during a follow-up period of 4 weeks. Healing characteristics were secondary outcomes. Of the 922 patients enrolled, 440 in the white petrolatum group and 444 in the bacitracin group were evaluable for clinical response. The 2 treatment groups had comparable baseline characteristics. Thirteen patients developed postprocedure infection (1.5%), 9 (2.0%) in the white petrolatum group vs 4 (0.9%) in the bacitracin group (95% confidence interval for difference, -0.4% to 2.7%; P=.37). Eight infections (1.8%) in the white petrolatum group were due to Staphylococcus aureus vs none in the bacitracin group (P=.004). No patient in the group using white petrolatum developed allergic contact dermatitis vs 4 patients (0.9%) in the group using bacitracin (P=.12). Additionally, there were no clinically significant differences in healing between the treatment groups on day 1 (P=.98), day 7 (P=.86), or day 28 (P=.28) after the procedure. White petrolatum is a safe, effective wound care ointment for ambulatory surgery. In comparison with bacitracin, white petrolatum possesses an equally low infection rate and minimal risk for induction of allergy.","A randomized controlled trial of 933 outpatients-with a total of 1249 wounds from sterile dermatologic surgeries-compared white petrolatum with bacitracin zinc ointment prophylaxis. The study found no statistically significant differences in post-procedure infection rates, though only 13 patients developed an infection (2% in petrolatum group vs. 0.9% in bacitracin zinc group; 95% CI for the difference, -0.4 to 2.7)."
"Do topical antibiotics improve wound healing
Patients undergoing contaminated head and neck surgery with flap reconstruction have wound infection rates of 20% to 25% with parenteral antibiotic prophylaxis. Studies suggest that perioperative antimicrobial mouthwash reduces oropharyngeal flora and may prevent wound infections. We hypothesized that the addition of topical antibiotics to a parenteral prophylactic regimen would reduce the incidence of wound infection in these high-risk patients. We performed a randomized, prospective clinical trial. Patients received either 1) parenteral piperacillin/tazobactam (3.375 g every 6 hours for 48 h) or 2) parenteral piperacillin/tazobactam plus topical piperacillin/tazobactam administered as a mouthwash immediately before surgery and once a day for 2 days postoperatively, with piperacillin/tazobactam added to the intraoperative irrigation solution. The wounds of all patients were evaluated daily using predefined objective criteria. Sixty-two patients met inclusion criteria and were enrolled in the study. The overall wound infection rate was 8.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.7%-17.8%). Two of 31 patients (6.4%) who received parenteral antibiotics alone developed a wound infection compared with 3 of 31 patients (9.7%) randomly assigned to receive topical plus parenteral antibiotics. This difference was not statistically significant (P = >.05). Infection rate was not associated with flap type (rotational vs. free tissue transfer), mandibular reconstruction, age, gender, tumor site, stage, surgical duration, or blood loss. These results suggest that piperacillin/tazobactam is a highly effective antibiotic for prevention of wound infection in patients undergoing flap reconstruction following contaminated head and neck surgery. However, the addition of topical piperacillin/tazobactam does not appear to enhance the prophylactic benefit of parenteral antibiotics alone.",A small but well-designed study of 62 patients with major contaminated wounds failed to show any additional benefit when topical piperacillin/tazobactam (not available in US as a topical agent) was added to parenteral piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) alone. Two of 31 patients on just parenteral antibiotics and 3 of 31 patients on both topical and parenteral antibiotics developed wound infections (P>.05).
"Do topical antibiotics improve wound healing
Topical antimicrobials have been considered for treatment of secondarily infected wounds because of the potential for reduced risk of adverse effects and greater patient convenience. We compared mupirocin cream with oral cephalexin in the treatment of wounds such as small lacerations, abrasions, or sutured wounds. In 2 identical randomized double-blind studies, 706 patients with secondarily infected wounds (small lacerations, abrasions, or sutured wounds) received either mupirocin cream topically 3 times daily or cephalexin orally 4 times daily for 10 days. Clinical success at follow-up was equivalent in the two groups: 95.1% and 95.3% in the mupirocin cream and the cephalexin groups, respectively (95% confidence interval [CI], -4.0% to 3.6%; P = .89). The intention-to-treat success rate was 83% in both groups. Bacteriologic success at follow-up was also comparable: 96.9% in the mupirocin cream and 98.9% in the cephalexin groups (95% CI, -6.0% to 2.0%; P = .22). The occurrence of adverse experiences related to study treatment was similar for the 2 groups, with fewer patients in the mupirocin cream group reporting diarrhea (1.1% vs 2.3% for cephalexin). Mupirocin cream applied topically 3 times daily is as effective as oral cephalexin given 4 times daily for the treatment of secondarily infected wounds and was well tolerated.","A study with 2 parallel, identical RCTs of a total of 706 patients found mupirocin cream (Bactroban) to be equivalent to oral cephalexin in the treatment of secondarily infected minor wounds, such as small lacerations, abrasions, or sutured wounds. Clinical success (95.1% for mupirocin and 95.3% for cephalexin), bacteriologic success (96.9% for mupirocin and 98.9% for cephalexin), as well as the intention-to-treat success rate of 83% at follow-up were equivalent in the 2 groups."
"What is the preferred treatment for a child with mild persistent asthma
Antiinflammatory therapies, such as inhaled corticosteroids or nedocromil, are recommended for children with asthma, although there is limited information on their long-term use. We randomly assigned 1041 children from 5 through 12 years of age with mild-to-moderate asthma to receive 200 microg of budesonide (311 children), 8 mg of nedocromil (312 children), or placebo (418 children) twice daily. We treated the participants for four to six years. All children used albuterol for asthma symptoms. There was no significant difference between either treatment and placebo in the primary outcome, the degree of change in the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1, expressed as a percentage of the predicted value) after the administration of a bronchodilator. As compared with the children assigned to placebo, the children assigned to receive budesonide had a significantly smaller decline in the ratio of FEV1 to forced vital capacity (FVC, expressed as a percentage) before the administration of a bronchodilator (decline in FEV1:FVC, 0.2 percent vs. 1.8 percent). The children given budesonide also had lower airway responsiveness to methacholine, fewer hospitalizations (2.5 vs. 4.4 per 100 person-years), fewer urgent visits to a caregiver (12 vs. 22 per 100 person-years), greater reduction in the need for albuterol for symptoms, fewer courses of prednisone, and a smaller percentage of days on which additional asthma medications were needed. As compared with placebo, nedocromil significantly reduced urgent care visits (16 vs. 22 per 100 person-years) and courses of prednisone. The mean increase in height in the budesonide group was 1.1 cm less than in the placebo group (22.7 vs. 23.8 cm, P=0.005); this difference was evident mostly within the first year. The height increase was similar in the nedocromil and placebo groups. In children with mild-to-moderate asthma, neither budesonide nor nedocromil is better than placebo in terms of lung function, but inhaled budesonide improves airway responsiveness and provides better control of asthma than placebo or nedocromil. The side effects of budesonide are limited to a small, transient reduction in growth velocity.","The Childhood Asthma Management Program (CAMP) study, which included 1041 children, evaluated treatment with either budesonide or nedocromil vs placebo. Patients taking budesonide had a lower rate of urgent care visits (absolute risk reduction [ARR]=10%; number needed to treat [NNT]=10; P=.02) compared with children taking nedocromil (ARR=6%; NNT=17; P=.02). The urgent care visits were reported as number of visits per 100 person-years. Children taking budesonide experienced 21.5% more episode-free days than those taking placebo (P=.01). No change was observed in the nedocromil group."
"What is the preferred treatment for a child with mild persistent asthma
Inhaled corticosteroids and oral theophylline are effective treatments for moderate asthma. We sought to compare the benefits and adverse reactions of theophylline and aerosol beclomethasone spray. A multicenter, double-blind, double-placebo, randomized, controlled trial of 1-year duration was performed. Seven hundred forty-seven patients with asthma received either beclomethasone dipropionate aerosol spray (84 microg four times per day) or sustained-release theophylline twice per day in doses adjusted for optimum control of the disease. The main outcome measures were daily diary of symptoms and peak flow rates (recorded on a mark-sense computer-readable form); supplemental bronchodilator use; doctor's office or hospital visits and absence from work or school; spirometry; methacholine testing; adverse experiences; and cortisol blood measurements. Both treatment strategies reduced symptoms promptly and achieved low absenteeism from work or school and low rates of emergency treatment for asthma. Both maintained nearly normal pulmonary function. Beclomethasone was statistically significantly more effective in reducing symptoms, supplemental bronchodilator and systemic glucocorticoid doses, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, and eosinophilia. However, the magnitude of these differences was small. Theophylline caused more headache, nervousness, insomnia, and gastrointestinal distress, and more patients discontinued treatment because of side effects. Beclomethasone caused more oropharyngeal candidiases and hoarseness and reduced morning plasma cortisol levels before and after cosyntropin. It reduced the rate of growth in children. No new cataracts or glaucoma developed. Theophylline effectively controlled symptoms at lower than the customarily recommended blood level. The risk/ benefit profiles of these agents suggest that inhaled corticosteroids may be the preferred agent for most adult patients and for some children.","Theophylline is considered an alternative to inhaled corticosteroids. One study compared beclomethasone with theophylline in 195 children. This study found near-equivalent efficacy in doctor visits, hospitalizations, monthly peak expiratory flow rates, and FEV1; however, beclomethasone was superior to theophylline in maintaining symptom control and decreasing the use of inhaled bronchodilators and systemic steroids. When compared with beclomethasone, theophylline was linked to 14% more central nervous system adverse effects (P<.001) and 17% more gastrointestinal disturbances (P<.001). Although beclomethasone induced more oral candidiasis compared with theophylline (8.9% vs 2.4%; P<.001), the incidence of this infection can be reduced by using a spacer."
"Angiotensin blockade for diabetes: Monitor microalbuminuria
We evaluated the renoprotective effects as reflected by short-term changes in albuminuria of dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) by adding an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) to treatment with maximal recommended doses of an ACE inhibitor (ACEI) in patients with type 2 diabetes and nephropathy. A total of 20 patients (17 men and 3 women) with type 2 diabetes along with hypertension and nephropathy were enrolled in this double-blind, randomized, two-period, crossover trial of 8 weeks of treatment with the ARB candesartan 16 mg daily and placebo added in random order to existing treatment with lisinopril/enalapril 40 mg daily or captopril 150 mg daily. At the end of each treatment period, we evaluated albuminuria in three 24-h urinary collections by turbidimetry, 24-h ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) using the Takeda-TM2420, and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) by the (51)Cr-EDTA plasma-clearance technique. During monoblockade of the RAS by ACEI treatment, albuminuria was 706 (349-1,219) mg/24 h [geometric mean (IQR)]; 24-h ABP was 138 +/- 3/72 +/- 2 mmHg (mean +/- SE); and GFR was 77 +/- 6 ml x min(-1) x 1.73 m(-2) (mean +/- SE). During dual blockade of the RAS by addition of candesartan 16 mg daily, there was a mean (95% CI) reduction in albuminuria of 28 (17-38) compared with ACEI alone (P < 0.001). There was a modest reduction in systolic/diastolic 24-h ABP of 3/2 mmHg (-2 to 8 systolic, -2 to 5 diastolic; NS). Changes in albuminuria did not correlate to changes in ABP. Addition of candesartan 16 mg daily induced a small, insignificant decrease in GFR of 4 (-1 to 9) ml x min(-1) x 1.73 m(-2). Dual blockade of the RAS provides superior short-term renoprotection independent of systemic blood pressure changes in comparison with maximally recommended doses of ACEI in patients with type 2 diabetes as well as nephropathy.","In very small randomized trial of 20 patients with type 2 diabetes, adding 16 mg of candesartan to the maximal dose of an ACE inhibitor decreased albuminuria an additional 28%."
"Is folate supplementation indicated for patients with CAD
To determine the size of reduction in homocysteine concentrations produced by dietary supplementation with folic acid and with vitamins B-12 or B-6. Meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials that assessed the effects of folic acid based supplements on blood homocysteine concentrations. Multivariate regression analysis was used to determine the effects on homocysteine concentrations of different doses of folic acid and of the addition of vitamin B-12 or B-6. Individual data on 1114 people included in 12 trials. The proportional and absolute reductions in blood homocysteine produced by folic acid supplements were greater at higher pretreatment blood homocysteine concentrations (P < 0.001) and at lower pretreatment blood folate concentrations (P < 0.001). After standardisation to pretreatment blood concentrations of homocysteine of 12 mumol/l and of folate of 12 nmol/l (approximate average concentrations for Western populations), dietary folic acid reduced blood homocysteine concentrations by 25% (95% confidence interval 23% to 28%; P < 0.001), with similar effects in the range of 0.5-5 mg folic acid daily. Vitamin B-12 (mean 0.5 mg daily) produced an additional 7% (3% to 10%) reduction in blood homocysteine. Vitamin B-6 (mean 16.5 mg daily) did not have a significant additional effect. Typically in Western populations, daily supplementation with both 0.5-5 mg folic acid and about 0.5 mg vitamin B-12 would be expected to reduce blood homocysteine concentrations by about a quarter to a third (for example, from about 12 mumol/l to 8-9 mumol/l). Large scale randomised trials of such regimens in high risk populations are now needed to determine whether lowering blood homocysteine concentrations reduces the risk of vascular disease.","A meta-analysis of 12 randomized controlled trials found that folate supplementation, with vitamin B6 and B12, reduces plasma homocysteine levels. However, the long-term clinical consequences of these interventions are unknown."
"Is folate supplementation indicated for patients with CAD
We sought to conduct a randomized trial with folic acid 0.5 mg/day in a patient population with stable coronary artery disease (CAD). Folic acid has favorable effects on vascular endothelium and lowers plasma homocysteine levels. In addition, homocysteine appears to be an independent risk factor for atherosclerotic disease. However, the value of folic acid in secondary prevention had seldom been tested. In this open-label study, 593 patients were included; 300 were randomized to folic acid and 293 served as controls. Mean follow-up time was 24 months. At baseline all patients had been on statin therapy for a mean of 3.2 years. In patients treated with folic acid, plasma homocysteine levels decreased by 18%, from 12.0 +/- 4.8 to 9.4 +/- 3.5 micromol/l, whereas these levels remained unaffected in the control group (p < 0.001 between groups). The primary end point (all-cause mortality and a composite of vascular events) was encountered in 31 (10.3%) patients in the folic acid group and in 28 (9.6%) patients in the control group (relative risk 1.05; 95% confidence interval: 0.63 to 1.75). In a multifactorial survival model with adjustments for clinical factors, the most predictive laboratory parameters were, in order of significance, levels of creatinine clearance, plasma fibrinogen, and homocysteine. Within two years, folic acid does not seem to reduce clinical end points in patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD) while on statin treatment. Homocysteine might therefore merely be a modifiable marker of disease. Thus, low-dose folic acid supplementation should be treated with reservation, until more trial outcomes become available.","A randomized, placebo-controlled trial of folate reporting clinical endpoints has been completed. The study analyzed folate supplementation in a patient population with known, stable CAD and found no difference in clinical endpoints at 24 months. In this study, 593 patients were randomized to receive either 0.5 mg/d of folic acid or placebo. The primary study endpoint was a composite of events including: overall mortality, sudden death, MI, stroke, and major vascular surgery. The study was powered to detect a 50% reduction in clinical events based on existing observational data in populations with CAD. An event rate of 15% for the 2-year interval was assumed. All patients in this study were on statin therapy prior to initiation of folate supplementation."
"Are inhalers with spacers better than nebulizers for children with asthma
To determine whether the administration of beta-agonists by metered-dose inhaler (MDI) with a spacer device is as effective as the administration of beta-agonists by nebulizer for the treatment of acute asthma exacerbations in children. Randomized trial with two arms. Urban pediatric emergency department (ED) in Bronx, NY. Convenience sample of 152 children 2 years and older with a history of at least two episodes of wheezing presenting to the ED with an acute asthma exacerbation. Patients were randomly assigned to receive standard doses of a beta-agonist (albuterol) by an MDI with spacer or by a nebulizer. Dosing intervals and the use of other medications were determined by the treating physician. Baseline characteristics and asthma history were recorded. Asthma severity score, peak expiratory flow rate in children 5 years or older, and oxygen saturation were determined at presentation and before admission or discharge. The groups did not differ in age, sex, ethnicity, age of onset of asthma, or asthma severity score at presentation. There were no significant differences between the groups in outcomes, including mean changes in respiratory rate, asthma severity score, and peak expiratory flow rate, oxygen saturation, number of treatments given, administration of steroids in the ED, and admission rate. Patients given MDIs with spacers required shorter treatment times in the ED (66 minutes vs 103 minutes, P < .001). Fewer patients in the spacer group had episodes of vomiting in the ED (9% vs 20%, P < .04), and patients in the nebulizer group had a significantly greater mean percent increase in heart rate from baseline to final disposition (15% vs 5%, P < .001). These data suggest that MDIs with spacers may be an effective alternative to nebulizers for the treatment of children with acute asthma exacerbations in the ED.","A randomized controlled trial of 152 patients found no difference in primary outcomes of asthma severity score, oxygen saturation, and percent predicted peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR). Several secondary outcomes slightly favored MDI/S: number of treatments given, whether steroids were used, change in heart rate, side effects, rate of hospital admission, and treatment time in the emergency department."
"Are inhalers with spacers better than nebulizers for children with asthma
To determine if administration of albuterol by a metered-dose inhaler with a spacer device is as efficacious as administration of albuterol by nebulizer to treat wheezing in children aged 2 years and younger. Double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Pediatric emergency department. From a convenience sample of wheezing children aged 2 to 24 months, 85 patients were enrolled in the nebulizer group and 83 in the spacer group. The nebulizer group received a placebo metered-dose inhaler with a spacer followed by nebulized albuterol. The spacer group received albuterol by a metered-dose inhaler with a spacer followed by nebulized isotonic sodium chloride solution. Treatments were given every 20 minutes by a single investigator blinded to group assignment. The primary outcome was admission rate. Pulmonary Index score and oxygen saturation were measured initially and 10 minutes after each treatment. The nebulizer group had a significantly higher mean (SD) initial Pulmonary Index score compared with the spacer group (7.6 [2.5] vs 6.6 [2.0]; P =.002). With the initial Pulmonary Index score controlled, children in the spacer group were admitted less (5% vs 20%; P =.05). Analyses also revealed an interaction between group and initial Pulmonary Index score; lower admission rates in the spacer group were found primarily in children having a more severe asthma exacerbation. Our data suggest that metered-dose inhalers with spacers may be as efficacious as nebulizers for the emergency department treatment of wheezing in children aged 2 years or younger.","One study showed a lower admission rate in 85 patients who were 2 to 24 months in the MDI/S group. Controlling for the initial Pulmonary Index score, children using an MDI and Aerochamber spacer were admitted less often (5% vs 20%, number needed to treat=7; P=.05) than children using nebulizers. Since the results of this single small trial are the only data available for this younger age group, using MDI/S instead of nebulizers should be done with caution for children aged <2 years."
"What is the best approach to a solitary pulmonary nodule identified by chest x-ray
Positron emission tomography (PET) with 18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is a potentially useful but expensive test to diagnose solitary pulmonary nodules. To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of strategies for pulmonary nodule diagnosis and to specifically compare strategies that did and did not include FDG-PET. Decision model. Accuracy and complications of diagnostic tests were estimated by using meta-analysis and literature review. Modeled survival was based on data from a large tumor registry. Cost estimates were derived from Medicare reimbursement and other sources. All adult patients with a new, noncalcified pulmonary nodule seen on chest radiograph. Patient lifetime. Societal. 40 clinically plausible combinations of 5 diagnostic interventions, including computed tomography, FDG-PET, transthoracic needle biopsy, surgery, and watchful waiting. Costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. The cost-effectiveness of strategies depended critically on the pretest probability of malignancy. For patients with low pretest probability (26%), strategies that used FDG-PET selectively when computed tomography results were possibly malignant cost as little as 20 000 dollars per QALY gained. For patients with high pretest probability (79%), strategies that used FDG-PET selectively when computed tomography results were benign cost as little as 16 000 dollars per QALY gained. For patients with intermediate pretest probability (55%), FDG-PET strategies cost more than 220 000 dollars per QALY gained because they were more costly but only marginally more effective than computed tomography-based strategies. The choice of strategy also depended on the risk for surgical complications, the probability of nondiagnostic needle biopsy, the sensitivity of computed tomography, and patient preferences for time spent in watchful waiting. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis, FDG-PET strategies were cost saving or cost less than 100 000 dollars per QALY gained in 76.7%, 24.4%, and 99.9% of computer simulations for patients with low, intermediate, and high pretest probability, respectively. FDG-PET should be used selectively when pretest probability and computed tomography findings are discordant or in patients with intermediate pretest probability who are at high risk for surgical complications. In most other circumstances, computed tomography-based strategies result in similar quality-adjusted life-years and lower costs.","CT appears cost-effective when the pretest probability of malignancy is <90%; therefore, consider it on virtually all new cases of solitary pulmonary nodules. Also, when CT and pretest risk-assessments are discordant (eg, a patient has a low pretest probability of malignancy but his CT is suggestive of malignancy), the FDG PET scan is the most economically feasible at less than $20,000 per quality-adjusted life year."
"What is the best approach to a solitary pulmonary nodule identified by chest x-ray
A clinical prediction model to identify malignant nodules based on clinical data and radiological characteristics of lung nodules was derived using logistic regression from a random sample of patients (n = 419) and tested on data from a separate group of patients (n = 210). To use multivariate logistic regression to estimate the probability of malignancy in radiologically indeterminate solitary pulmonary nodules (SPNs) in a clinically relevant subset of patients with SPNs that measured between 4 and 30 mm in diameter. A retrospective cohort study at a multispecialty group practice included 629 patients (320 men, 309 women) with newly discovered (between January 1, 1984, and May 1, 1986) 4- to 30-mm radiologically indeterminate SPNs on chest radiography. Patients with a diagnosis of cancer within 5 years prior to the discovery of the nodule were excluded. Clinical data included age, sex, cigarette-smoking status, and history of extrathoracic malignant neoplasm, asbestos exposure, and chronic interstitial or obstructive lung disease; chest radiological data included the diameter, location, edge characteristics (eg, lobulation, spiculation, and shagginess), and other characteristics (eg, cavitation) of the SPNs. Predictors were identified in a random sample of two thirds of the patients and tested in the remaining one third. Sixty-five percent of the nodules were benign, 23% were malignant, and 12% were indeterminate. Three clinical characteristics (age, cigarette-smoking status, and history of cancer [diagnosis, > or = 5 years ago]) and 3 radiological characteristics (diameter, spiculation, and upper lobe location of the SPNs) were independent predictors of malignancy. The area (+/-SE) under the evaluated receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.8328 +/- 0.0226. Three clinical and 3 radiographic characteristics predicted the malignancy in radiologically indeterminate SPNs.",The best available clinical decision rule was derived and validated from a single split population of patients with solitary pulmonary nodules. The outcome variable was defined as malignancy based on histologic tissue analysis or benignity by radiographic stability or resolution over 2 years. The authors did not report whether those determining outcomes and predictors were appropriately blinded.
"Is exercise treadmill testing useful for detecting heart disease in women
To determine the accuracy of the exercise electrocardiogram (ECG), exercise thallium, and exercise echocardiogram (echo) for the diagnosis of coronary artery disease in women, English language studies published between 1966 and 1995 were identified through a MEDLINE search. Studies that contained data on at least 50 women who underwent both an exercise test and coronary angiography were examined. Studies were reviewed for sensitivity, specificity, and methodologic characteristics by 2 independent reviewers. Nineteen studies met the inclusion criteria for exercise electrocardiography, 5 studies for exercise thallium, and 3 studies for exercise echo. The exercise ECG had a weighted mean sensitivity, specificity, and a likelihood ratio (LR) of 0.61 (95% confidence intervals 0.54 to 0.68), 0.70 (0.64 to 0.75), (+) LR 2.25 (1.84 to 2.66), (-) LR 0.55 (0.47 to 0.62), respectively. The exercise thallium had a weighted mean sensitivity, specificity, and LRs of 0.78 (0.72 to 0.83), 0.64 (0.51 to 0.77), (+) LR 2.87 (1.0 to 4.96), (-) LR 0.36 (0.27 to 0.45). The exercise echo had a weighted mean sensitivity, specificity, and LRs of 0.86 (0.75 to 0.96), 0.79 (0.72 to 0.86), (+) LR 4.29 (2.93 to 5.65), (-) LR 0.18 (0.05 to 0.31). Thallium subset analysis revealed that studies using planar imaging were more specific than those using tomographic imaging. Thus, currently available exercise tests are only moderately sensitive and specific for the diagnosis of coronary artery disease in women.","A large meta-analysis of 19 studies looked specifically at women (n=3721) and found that noninvasive exercise tests only ""moderately useful"" for the detection of CAD. Exercise treadmill testing in women had a specificity of 0.70 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.64-0.75), a sensitivity of 0.61 (95% CI, 0.54-0.68), a positive likelihood ratio of 2.25 (95% CI, 1.84-2.66) and a negative likelihood ratio of 0.55 (95% CI, 0.47-0.62). In comparison, exercise treadmill testing in men had a sensitivity of 0.70 and a specificity of 0.77. Among the theoretical reasons for the diminished accuracy of the exercise treadmill testing in women are the varying catecholamine response to exercise, a higher incidence of mitral valve prolapse, and chest wall anatomy different than that in men."
"Does treatment of acne with Retin A and tetracycline cause adverse effects
To document changes in the prevalence of resistance of Propionibacterium acnes to antibiotics used for treating acne. MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched for publications on P. acnes resistance to systemic antibiotics. The search strategy mapped ""acne"" or ""acne vulgaris"" with the terms ""antibiotic resistance"" or ""drug resistance, microbial"". Only papers published in English during 1976 to 1997 were included in the search. 53 publications met the search criteria. The search output was refined by selecting papers that specifically addressed P. acnes resistance patterns. Additional studies (not included in the search output) were identified from review articles and references of the retrieved articles. Twelve articles were reviewed. Data on the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant propionibacteria, the incidence of individual resistance phenotypes, mixed resistance, and correlation between poor therapeutic response and resistant propionibacteria were extracted. Research since 1978 has suggested an association between poor therapeutic response and antibiotic-resistant propionibacteria. The overall incidence of P. acnes antibiotic resistance has increased from 20% in 1978 to 62% in 1996. Resistance to specific antibiotics varied and was most commonly reported with erythromycin and clindamycin, tetracycline and doxcycline, and trimethoprim. Resistance to minocycline is rare. In many patients with acne, continued treatment with antibiotics can be inappropriate or ineffective. It is important to recognise therapeutic failure and alter treatment accordingly. The use of long-term rotational antibiotics is outdated and will only exacerbate antibiotic resistance.",Rotating antibiotics on a long-term basis actually increases bacterial resistance patterns and can exacerbate the problems of increasing resistance and poor treatment outcomes.
"Which blood tests are most helpful in evaluating pelvic inflammatory disease
To evaluate the diagnostic test characteristics of common tests used to diagnose upper genital tract infection. Subjects included women who either met the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's minimal criteria for acute pelvic inflammatory disease or who had other signs of upper genital tract infection (i.e., atypical pelvic pain, abnormal uterine bleeding, or cervicitis). The subjects were evaluated with a baseline interview, comprehensive laboratory testing, and either an endometrial biopsy or laparoscopy for definitive diagnosis of upper genital tract infection. Patients were considered positive for upper genital tract infection if they had any of the following findings: 1) histologic evidence of acute endometriosis or salpingitis, 2) laparoscopic visualization of purulent exudate in the pelvis without another source, or 3) positive testing for Neisseria gonorrhoeae or Chlamydia trachomatis from the endometrium, fallopian tubes, or pelvis. One hundred twenty women with adequate endometrial samples were evaluated between August 1993 and September 1995. The median age of the study population was 24 years: 38% were white, 52% were smokers, 81% were insured by Medicaid or were uninsured, and 67% were single. Sensitivities for elevated white blood cell count (WBC), erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and increased vaginal white blood cells are 57, 70, 71, and 78%, respectively. If any one test is abnormal, the sensitivity is 100% and specificity is 18%. If all four tests are abnormal, sensitivity is 29% and specificity is 95%. Testing for increased vaginal white blood cells was found to be the most sensitive laboratory indicator for upper genital tract infection, whereas serum WBC was the most specific. No one diagnostic laboratory test is pathognomonic for upper genital tract infection. Combinations of positive tests can improve diagnostic specificity and positive predictive value, but with a diminution of sensitivity and negative predictive value. Combinations of negative tests can reliably exclude upper genital tract infection.","A prospective cohort study of 120 women presenting to an ambulatory center with symptoms of PID evaluated the tests commonly used to support the clinical diagnosis of PID. The objective criteria used for diagnosis included histologic evidence of acute endometritis via endometrial biopsy, purulent exudates in the pelvis on laparoscopy, or microbiologic evidence of Neisseris gonorrhea or Chlamydia trachomatis from the upper genital tract. The Table shows the sensitivities, specificities, and predictive values for an elevated white blood cells (>10,000/mm), ESR (>15 mm/hr), CRP (>5 mg/dL), and increased vaginal white blood cells (>3 white blood cells/high-power field) for detection of PID. If all 4 test results are negative, PID is reliably ruled out with a sensitivity of 100%. These results may be an overestimate, as the gold standard was not uniformly applied."
"How effective are leukotriene inhibitors for asthma in children
We tested the hypothesis that adding montelukast to budesonide would improve asthma control in children with inhaled glucocorticoid-dependent persistent asthma. In a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, crossover study, we compared the benefit of adding montelukast, 5 mg, or placebo once daily to budesonide, 200 microg, twice daily. After a 1-month run-in with budesonide, 200 microg, twice daily, 279 children were randomized to montelukast or placebo. The mean +/- SD age was 10.4 +/- 2.2 years, the mean forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV(1)) was 77.7% +/- 10.6% predicted, and reversibility was 18.1% +/- 12.9%. Compared with adding placebo to budesonide, adding montelukast produced significant improvements in mean percent change from baseline FEV(1) (P =.062 [P =.010 for per-protocol analysis]), mean absolute change from baseline FEV(1) (P =.040), mean increase from baseline in morning (P =.023) and evening (P =.012) peak expiratory flows, decrease in exacerbation days by approximately 23% (P <.001), decreased beta2-agonist use (P =.013), and reduced blood eosinophil counts (P <.001). The treatments did not differ significantly with regard to safety. Montelukast, 5 mg, added to budesonide improved asthma control significantly, indicated by a small additive effect on lung function and a clinically relevant decrease in asthma exacerbation days.","One randomized, double-blind crossover study of 279 children with corticosteroid-dependent (persistent) asthma compared montelukast 5 mg (Singulair) once a day plus inhaled budesonide 200 µg (Pulmicort) twice a day with placebo plus budesonide (Rhinocort). Each study period lasted only 4 weeks, starting after a 4-week run-in period. Montelukast modestly improved asthma control over placebo. Compared with the placebo period, montelukast decreased the average use of beta-agonists by 1 puff per day. Asthma exacerbation days decreased by about 1 per month during montelukast treatment. The effects of montelukast and placebo on forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), quality of life, and adverse events did not differ significantly."
"Does early detection of suspected atherosclerotic renovascular hypertension change outcomes
Many patients with peripheral vascular disease have coincident renal artery stenosis. The present study characterized the natural history of the condition. Some 98 patients (71 men) with more than 50 per cent atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis (unilateral 64, bilateral 34) were recruited prospectively. Measurements of serum creatinine, blood pressure and renal size were recorded at baseline and every 6 months, for a minimum of 2 years. Data were available for 85 patients with a minimum follow-up of 2 years. The mean age was 71 (range 51-87) years. All 52 patients with unilateral renal artery stenosis were managed conservatively (group 1); 21 of the 33 patients with bilateral disease had no intervention (group 2) and the remaining 12 had angioplasty or reconstruction (group 3). The overall mortality rate was 32 per cent at 2 years (27 patients) and this was similar in all three groups. In only three patients was death related directly to renovascular disease; coronary disease accounted for the majority of deaths. All three patients who needed dialysis died within 1 year. In survivors from groups 1 and 3 there was a significant increase in serum creatinine concentration at follow-up. Blood pressure did not increase significantly. Patients with renal artery stenosis and peripheral vascular disease had a poor prognosis, but this was not directly attributable to renal failure.","A nonblinded RCT of 85 patients found no change in mortality or renal function with intervention. Three groups were compared: observation of 52 patients with unilateral RAS (>50%), intervention on 12 patients with bilateral RAS, and observation of 21 patients with bilateral RAS. All groups reported 32% mortality at 2 years. Only 3 of the 27 deaths were directly related to renal disease (2 from the observation group with unilateral RAS and one from the intervention group)."
"When should travelers begin malaria prophylaxis
The in vivo and in vitro response of Plasmodium falciparum to a single oral dose of mefloquine (25 mg/kg body weight (M25) or 15 mg/kg (M15] was studied in children under 5 years of age in Malawi. Of the children who received mefloquine, 35% vomited at least once, and 10% did not tolerate the drug because of vomiting. The therapy failure rates for the M25 group on day 7, 14, and 28 were 15%, 18%, and 42%, respectively, and these did not differ significantly from those for the M15 group (4%, 18%, and 59%). In contrast, 34 in vitro microtests (17 per group) showed schizont inhibition at less than or equal to 32 pmol mefloquine per test well. On day 7, the concentration of mefloquine in samples of blood was significantly lower in both the M25 and M15 groups for children who were parasitaemic on day 7 than in samples from those who were aparasitaemic. A positive blood smear on day 7 was strongly associated with a mefloquine concentration of less than 500 ng/ml blood on day 2 or day 7 (P less than 0.0003). Vomiting was associated with a low mefloquine concentration on day 2 but not day 7. These results suggest that mefloquine is effective against P. falciparum in Malawi but that for young children the therapy appears to be complicated by frequent vomiting.",One study of 293 children under the age of 5 years in Malawi found that plasma concentrations of mefloquine were below prophylactic level (500 mcg/mL) against P falciparum until the fourth to seventh week of once-weekly dosing (P<.0003).
"Do COX-2 inhibitors worsen renal function
The cardiorenal safety database from the Celecoxib Long-term Arthritis Safety Study (CLASS) was analyzed to examine whether supratherapeutic doses of celecoxib are associated with decreased renal function and blood pressure (BP) effects compared with standard doses of diclofenac and ibuprofen in osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients.In total, 8059 patients were enrolled; 7968 received at least one dose of study drug (RA: N = 2183; OA: N = 5785). Patients received celecoxib, 400 mg twice a day (b.i.d.). (N = 3987); ibuprofen, 800 mg three times a day. (N = 1985); or diclofenac, 75 mg b.i.d. (N = 1996). Effects measured included: investigator-reported hypertension, edema or congestive heart failure, clinically important BP elevations, incidence of patients starting new antihypertensive medication, and increases in serum creatinine or reductions in creatinine clearance. Celecoxib was associated with a similar incidence of hypertension or edema to diclofenac but significantly lower than ibuprofen. The celecoxib group had significantly fewer initiations of antihypertensives versus ibuprofen. Systolic BP increases of >20 mmHg and above 140 mmHg occurred significantly less often with celecoxib compared with ibuprofen or diclofenac. Changes in serum creatinine or estimated creatinine clearance occurred in a similar percentage of patients taking celecoxib or ibuprofen; modest differences were evident against diclofenac. In patients with mild prerenal azotemia, significantly fewer patients taking celecoxib exhibited clinically important reductions in renal function (3.7%), compared with diclofenac (7.3%; P < 0.05) and ibuprofen (7.3%; P < 0.05). A supratherapeutic dose of celecoxib was associated with an improved cardiorenal safety profile compared with standard doses of either ibuprofen or diclofenac.",A randomized controlled trial compared standard dosing of diclofenac (75 mg twice daily) and ibuprofen (800 mg 3 times daily) with high-dose celecoxib (400 mg twice daily) for patients with normal kidney function being treated for osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. The mean increase in serum creatinine in the celecoxib arm was less than that noted in the diclofenac controls (0.009 mg/dL vs 0.027 mg/dL; P<.05; number needed to harm [NNH]=56). No difference in mean serum creatinine was seen among those patients using ibuprofen (800 mg 3 times daily) compared with those using high-dose celecoxib.
"Menstrual disturbances in perimenopausal women: What's best
Heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) is an important cause of ill health in premenopausal women. Although surgery is often used as a treatment, a range of medical therapies are also available. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs reduce prostaglandin levels which are elevated in women with excessive menstrual bleeding and also may have a beneficial effect on dysmenorrhoea. The primary objective of this review was to investigate the effectiveness of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in achieving a reduction in menstrual blood loss in women of reproductive years HMB. We searched the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders & Subfertility Group trials register (searched April 2007), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, Issue 1, 2007), MEDLINE (1966 to April 2007), EMBASE (1985 to April 2007), CINAHL (1982 to April 2007), Current Contents (1993 to April 2007) and reference lists of articles. We also contacted manufacturers and researchers in the field. The inclusion criteria were randomised comparisons of individual NSAIDs with either each other, placebo or other medical treatments in women with regular heavy periods measured either objectively or subjectively and with no pathological or iatrogenic (treatment induced) causes for their heavy menstrual blood loss. Seventeen RCTs were identified that fulfilled the inclusion criteria for this review and data were extracted independently. Odds ratios for dichotomous outcomes and weighted mean differences for continuous outcomes were estimated from the data of nine trials. The results of the remaining seven crossover trials with data unsuitable for pooling and one trial with skewed data were described in the Other Data section. As a group, NSAIDs were more effective than placebo at reducing heavy menstrual bleeding but less effective than either tranexamic acid, danazol or the levonorgestrel releasing intrauterine system (LNG IUS). Treatment with danazol caused a shorter duration of menstruation and more adverse events than NSAIDs but this did not appear to affect the acceptability of treatment. There were no statistically significant differences between NSAIDs and the other treatments (oral luteal progestogen, ethamsylate, an older progesterone releasing intra-uterine system (Progestasert), oral contraceptive pill (OCC)) but most studies were underpowered. There was no evidence of a difference between the individual NSAIDs (naproxen and mefenamic acid) in reducing HMB. NSAIDs reduce HMB when compared with placebo but are less effective than either tranexamic acid, danazol or LNG IUS. However, adverse events are more severe with danazol therapy. In the limited number of small studies suitable for evaluation, no significant difference in efficacy was demonstrated between NSAIDs and other medical treatments such as oral luteal progestogen, ethamsylate, OCC or another type of IUS, Progestasert.","A Cochrane review of 16 small RCTs that examined the use of NSAIDs for menorrhagia found NSAIDs to be superior to placebo and comparable to other medical treatments such as luteal progestin, oral contraceptive pills, and progestin-releasing intrauterine systems."
"Menstrual disturbances in perimenopausal women: What's best
To evaluate the putative benefits of combined continuous hormone replacement therapy for postmenopausal women. A Medline search was performed for relevant English-language studies published during 1981-1995. METHOD OF STUDY SELECTION: Forty-two studies were identified, all using a continuous daily regimen of an estrogen and a progestin given to postmenopausal women with intact uteri. Each study was reviewed for the design, number of subjects enrolled, duration of protocol, and type and dosage of medications used. Data were extracted from texts, tables, figures, or personal communications regarding the effects of treatment on patient compliance (ie, drop-out rates), the occurrence of vasomotor symptoms, uterine bleeding patterns, endometrial histology, and lipid and bone density measurements. These data were then arranged in tabular form for the purpose of comparing and identifying trends. The lipid data from six randomized, double-blind studies that compared sequential and combined continuous regimens of conjugated equine estrogen and medroxyprogesterone acetate were further analyzed by meta-analysis. Findings revealed compliance rates of approximately 80% (range 35-100). Vasomotor symptoms improved almost universally. Irregular uterine bleeding was noted to be a common problem in the first 6 months of treatment; thereafter, most studies reported rates of amenorrhea of 75% or greater. In patients undergoing endometrial biopsy, rates of atrophic endometrium were noted to be 90-100%, and rates of endometrial hyperplasia were less than 1%. Adenocarcinoma of the endometrium was documented in two patients with a history of atypical endometrial hyperplasia and bleeding after established amenorrhea. The effects of treatment on lipid levels varied from study to study, but a meta-analysis revealed the combined continuous and sequential regimens to produce a treatment-associated decline in total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and an increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Studies examining bone density documented either no change or an increase with treatment. Combined continuous hormone replacement is well accepted by patients in clinical trials, effective in relieving vasomotor symptoms, and produces amenorrhea (though often after an initial period of irregular bleeding), an atrophic endometrium, and favorable changes in circulating lipids as well as maintaining bone density. Data on the impact of this regimen on long-term patient compliance, cardiovascular disease risk, and urogenital atrophy are lacking.","A systematic review, comprised primarily of RCTs, examined uterine bleeding patterns in 3000 postmenopausal women taking combined continuous hormones (various regimens of estrogen and progestin). In 22 of 23 studies that included data past 6 months, 75% or more of participants became amenorrheic while on therapy. Irregular uterine bleeding before 6 months of therapy was common, however, and was presumed to lower patient compliance."
"Sleep apnea in adults: How accurate is clinical prediction
To establish the evidence base for the diagnosis of sleep apnea (SA) in adult patients, a systematic review of the literature from 1980 through November 1, 1997 was performed. Diagnostic studies were included if they reported results of any test to establish or support a diagnosis of SA, in comparison to a diagnosis from a full polysomnogram (PSG). Test results were meta-analyzed using fixed effects models and summary receiver operating characteristic curves (ROCs) to examine consistency of tests within and between diagnostics vs. the ""gold standard"" of PSG. From a total of 937 studies, 249 fit the broad eligibility criteria for inclusion in the clinical trial database and its data were extracted from these reports; useable data for statistical analyses were reported in 71 studies (7,572 patients). The sensitivity and specificity of partial channel and partial time PSGs appeared most promising as replacements for full PSG in patients suspected of obstructive SA. Clinical prediction rules (multivariate models) were also promising. Studies of portable sleep monitors, radiologic or morphologic features, and focused questionnaires were too heterogeneous to be meta-analyzed. In general, the diversity of study designs and objectives were very high and the methodological rigor of these studies as assessments of diagnostic tests was very low. Thus, we are still not in a position to recommend standardization of diagnostic methodology for sleep apnea. Instead, our recommendations for future research include standardization of terms and diagnostic criteria, and consistently reported statistics to enhance the utility of this literature.","A systematic review and meta-analysis of 249 studies of sleep apnea diagnosis from 1980 through November 1997 concluded that studies of focused questionnaires were too heterogeneous to be combined in a meta-analysis. Sensitivity and specificity were good for clinical prediction rules in general, but evidence was insufficient to justify adoption of any single model."

Optimization of the indications for nocturnal polysomnography in the diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) could lead to significant reductions in health expenditure. To this end, we assessed the usefulness of truncal obesity measurements in the diagnosis of OSAS. One hundred ninety-two patients (152 men and 40 women) referred to our clinic with suspected OSAS underwent a complete polysomnography study and their BMI and truncal obesity measurements were obtained. Comparison of patients defined as snorers with OSAS patients, by means of the Student's t -test revealed significant differences in the truncal obesity parameters such as waist-to-hip ratio (0.94 vs. 0.98) and waist circumference (100.7 cm vs. 106.3 cm). We found no significant differences between BMI values in the two groups. Indices of truncal obesity were analyzed as predictive factors for OSAS using a multivariate logistic regression model that included variable sex, and in which waist-to-hip ratio, BMI, neck circumference, and age were analyzed as binary variables. According to this model, our patients' risk of suffering from OSAS was 2.6 times greater if the waist-to-hip ratio was >1 in men and >0.85 in women. The risk of OSAS was also increased if the patients were men or over 52 years of age. Obtaining simple measurements such as those for truncal obesity may help prioritize the use of polysomnography in patients with a greater risk of OSAS. Our results suggest that BMI is not a good predictor of OSAS in a group of patients with a high BMI.",A cross-sectional study correlating OSAHS with truncal obesity in 192 patients referred to a sleep clinic found that the likelihood of OSAHS was 2.6 times greater if the waist-to-hip ratio was >1 in men and >0.85 in women.
"Sleep apnea in adults: How accurate is clinical prediction
To assess the clinical usefulness of the Mallampati score in patients with obstructive sleep apnea. Mallampati scoring of the orophyarynx is a simple noninvasive method used to assess the difficulty of endotracheal intubation, but its clinical usefulness has not been validated in patients with sleep-disordered breathing. Prospective multivariate assessment of a predictor variable. The UCSF Sleep Disorders Center. One hundred thirty-seven adult patients who were evaluated for possible obstructive sleep apnea. Prospective determination of the Mallampati score, assessment of other variables for multivariate analysis, and subsequent overnight polysomnography. The Mallampati score was an independent predictor of both the presence and severity of obstructive sleep apnea. On average, for every 1-point increase in the Mallampati score, the odds of having obstructive sleep apnea (apnea-hypopnea index> or = 5) increased more than 2-fold (odds ratio [per 1-point increase] = 2.5; 95% confidence interval: 1.2-5.0; p = .01), and the apnea-hypopnea index increased by more than 5 events per hour (coefficient = 5.2; 95% confidence interval: 0.2-10; p = .04). These results were independent of more than 30 variables that reflected airway anatomy, body habitus, symptoms, and medical history. Our results indicate that Mallampati scoring is a useful part of the physical examination of patients prior to polysomnography. The independent association between Mallampati score and presence and severity of obstructive sleep apnea suggests that this scoring system will have practical value in clinical settings and prospective studies of sleep-disordered breathing.","Mallampati scoring grades visibility of the posterior pharynx when the patient opens his mouth and sticks out his tongue. Visibility is ranked on a scale of 1 to 4, with 1 representing the greatest visibility and 4 the least. Prospective multivariate assessment of Mallampati scores in adults referred to a sleep clinic yielded likelihood ratios of OSAHS for Mallampati grades 1 to 4 of 0.4, 0.7, 1.6, and 1.7, respectively."
"How should you manage an overweight breastfed infant
Observational studies suggest a longer duration of breastfeeding to be associated dose dependently with a decrease in risk of overweight in later life. The authors performed a comprehensive meta-analysis of the existing studies on duration of breastfeeding and risk of overweight. Studies were included that reported the odds ratio and 95% confidence interval (or the data to calculate them) of overweight associated with breastfeeding and that reported the duration of breastfeeding and used exclusively formula-fed subjects as the referent. Seventeen studies met the inclusion criteria. By meta-regression, the duration of breastfeeding was inversely associated with the risk of overweight (regression coefficient=0.94, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.89, 0.98). Categorical analysis confirmed this dose-response association (<1 month of breastfeeding: odds ratio (OR)=1.0, 95% CI: 0.65, 1.55; 1-3 months: OR=0.81, 95% CI: 0.74, 0.88; 4-6 months: OR=0.76, 95% CI: 0.67, 0.86; 7-9 months: OR=0.67, 95% CI: 0.55, 0.82; >9 months: OR=0.68, 95% CI: 0.50, 0.91). One month of breastfeeding was associated with a 4% decrease in risk (OR=0.96/month of breastfeeding, 95% CI: 0.94, 0.98). The definitions of overweight and age had no influence. These findings strongly support a dose-dependent association between longer duration of breastfeeding and decrease in risk of overweight.","A meta-analysis showed a dose-dependent relationship between longer duration of breastfeeding and decreased risk of overweight in later life (<1 month of breastfeeding: odds ratio [OR]=1.0; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.65-1.55; 1-3 months: OR=0.81; 95% CI, 0.74-0.88; 4-6 months: OR=0.76; 95% CI, 0.67-0.86; 7-9 months: OR=0.67; 95% CI, 0.55-0.82; >9 months: OR=0.68; 95% CI, 0.50-0.91)."
"How should you manage an overweight breastfed infant
The evaluation of child growth trajectories and the interventions designed to improve child health are highly dependent on the growth charts used. The U.S. CDC and the WHO, in May 2000 and April 2006, respectively, released new growth charts to replace the 1977 NCHS reference. The WHO charts are based for the first time on a prescriptive, prospective, international sample of infants selected to represent optimum growth. This article compares the WHO and CDC curves and evaluates the growth performance of healthy breast-fed infants according to both. As expected, there are important differences between the WHO and CDC charts that vary by age group, growth indicator, and specific Z-score curve. Differences are particularly important during infancy, which is likely due to differences in study design and characteristics of the sample, such as type of feeding. Overall, the CDC charts reflect a heavier, and somewhat shorter, sample than the WHO sample. This results in lower rates of undernutrition (except during the first 6 mo of life) and higher rates of overweight and obesity when based on the WHO standards. Healthy breast-fed infants track along the WHO standard's weight-for-age mean Z-score while appearing to falter on the CDC chart from 2 mo onwards. Shorter measurement intervals in the WHO standards result in a better tool for monitoring the rapid and changing rate of growth in early infancy. Their adoption would have important implications for the assessment of lactation performance and the adequacy of infant feeding and would bring coherence between the tools used to assess growth and U.S. national guidelines that recommend breast-feeding as the optimal source of nutrition during infancy.","The WHO growth curves (http://www.who.int/childgrowth/standards/en/), rather than the CDC charts, should be used to monitor the growth of exclusively breastfed babies. The CDC charts reflect a heavier and shorter sample of infants. Moreover, the WHO charts are based on shorter measurement intervals and may therefore be a better tool for measuring rapidly changing rates of growth."
"When should you treat scabies empirically
In order to help primary health care (PHC) workers in developing countries in the care of common skin diseases, an algorithm for the management of pyoderma, scabies, superficial mycoses, contact dermatitis and referral of early leprosy cases (based on the identification of diseases through the presence of objective key signs, and on treatments by generic drugs) was elaborated. One thousand patients were seen by trained dermatologists, who established diagnoses and treatments; in addition, there was systematic recording of each key sign, according to the successive algorithm steps. We compared the diagnostics and treatments obtained for several combinations of diagnostic signs, with those of the dermatologists. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of defined combinations were high for pyoderma, scabies and superficial mycoses. Values were less exact for dermatitis and leprosy, but were considered sufficient for the level of health care targeted. The apportionment of treatments between the algorithm and the dermatological approaches was considered appropriate in more than 80% of cases; mismanagement was possible in 7% of cases, with few predictable harmful consequences. The algorithm was found satisfactory for the management of the dermatological priorities according to the standards required at the PHC level.","The only study we found that investigated the sensitivity of clinical features in diagnosing scabies was done in sub-Saharan Africa. In this study, the presence of diffuse itching, plus lesions in at least 2 locations typical with scabies or a household member with itch, had 100% sensitivity and 96.9% specificity for scabies infection. This study used the evaluation of a dermatologist as a gold standard. The authors propose that treatment based on clinical findings with or without microscopic confirmation is appropriate; however, it is not clear how these data translate to a primary care population with a lower prevalence of scabies."
"When should you treat scabies empirically
Scabies and lice infestations are almost an everyday diagnosis in the dermatology clinics. Along with the unbearable itch, resistance to medication, secondary infection, and the high risk for spreading the parasite to their close contacts, the patients have also to battle with many myths, prejudice, and shames connected to those infestations.",It is known that an initial infestation with scabies will not lead to pruritus for up to 4 to 6 weeks.
"What measures relieve postherpetic neuralgia
Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) is a complication of acute herpes zoster, which is emerging as a preferred clinical trial model for chronic neuropathic pain. Although there are published meta-analyses of analgesic therapy in PHN, and neuropathic pain in general, the evidence base has been substantially enhanced by the recent publication of several major trials. Therefore, we have conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis for both efficacy and adverse events of analgesic therapy for PHN. We systematically searched databases (MEDLINE 1966-2004, EMBASE 1988-2004, CINAHL 1982-2002, and PubMed [29 October 2004]) for trials of PHN. We also searched references of retrieved studies and review articles for further trials. We included trials that examined adult patients with PHN of greater duration than 3 mo, that were blinded, randomised, and had at least one measure of pain outcome. Dichotomous pain outcome data were extracted for 50% decrease in baseline pain using a hierarchy of pain/pain-relief measurement tools. Where available, dichotomous data were also collected for adverse events. Calculated estimates of efficacy included relative benefit and number needed to treat. Of 62 studies identified, 35 were randomised controlled trials. Of these, 31 were placebo controlled and suitable for meta-analysis, from which it was possible to extract dichotomous efficacy outcome data from 25. This meta-analysis revealed that there is evidence to support the use of the following orally administered therapies: tricyclic antidepressants, ""strong"" opioids, gabapentin, tramadol, and pregabalin. Topical therapies associated with efficacy were lidocaine 5% patch and capsaicin. Finally, a single study of spinal intrathecal administration of lidocaine and methyl prednisolone demonstrated efficacy, although this has yet to be replicated. Data suggest that the following therapies are not associated with efficacy in PHN: certain NMDA receptor antagonists (e.g., oral memantine, oral dextromethorphan, intravenous ketamine), codeine, ibuprofen, lorazepam, certain 5HT1 receptor agonists, and acyclovir. Topical administration of benzydamine, diclofenac/diethyl ether, and vincristine (iontophoresis) are similarly not associated with efficacy, nor are intrathecal administration of lidocaine alone or epidural administration of lidocaine and methylprednisolone, intravenous therapy with lidocaine, subcutaneous injection of Cronassial, or acupuncture. However, many of the trials that demonstrated a lack of efficacy represented comparatively low numbers of patient episodes or were single-dose studies, so it may be appropriate to regard such interventions as ""not yet adequately tested"" rather than demonstrating ""no evidence of efficacy."" Topical aspirin/diethyl ether has not been adequately tested. The evidence base supports the oral use of tricyclic antidepressants, certain opioids, and gabapentinoids in PHN. Topical therapy with lidocaine patches and capsaicin is similarly supported. Intrathecal administration of methylprednisolone appears to be associated with high efficacy, but its safety requires further evaluation.","A Systematic Review concluded that tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are effective treatments for PHN. Amitriptyline, the best studied TCA, provides at least moderate pain relief in two-thirds of patients with a pooled number needed to treat (NNT) for TCAs of 2.64 (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.1-3.54). It found gabapentin to be effective, with a range of NNT from 2.8 to 5.3 for as much as 50% pain reduction based on the visual analog score (VAS)."
"What measures relieve postherpetic neuralgia
This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review published in Issue 3, 2005 of The Cochrane Library. For many years antidepressant drugs have been used to manage neuropathic pain, and are often the first choice treatment. It is not clear, however, which antidepressant is more effective, what role the newer antidepressants can play in treating neuropathic pain, and what adverse effects are experienced by patients. To determine the analgesic effectiveness and safety of antidepressant drugs in neuropathic pain. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of antidepressants in neuropathic pain were identified in MEDLINE (1966 to Oct 2005); EMBASE (1980 to Oct 2005); the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library, Issue 3, 2005; and the Cochrane Pain, Palliative and Supportive Care Trials Register (May 2002). Additional reports were identified from the reference list of the retrieved papers, and by contacting investigators. RCTs reporting the analgesic effects of antidepressant drugs in adult patients, with subjective assessment of pain of neuropathic origin. Studies that included patients with chronic headache and migraine were excluded. Two review authors agreed the included studies, extracted data, and assessed methodological quality independently. Sixty one trials of 20 antidepressants were considered eligible (3293 participants) for inclusion. Relative Risk (RR) and Number-Needed-to-Treat (NNTs) were calculated from dichotomous data for effectiveness and adverse effects. This update includes 11 additional studies (778 participants). Sixty one RCTs were included in total. Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are effective and have an NNT of 3.6 (95% CI 3 to 4.5) RR 2.1 (95% CI 1.8 to 2.5) for the achievement of at least moderate pain relief. There is limited evidence for the effectiveness of the newer SSRIs but no studies of SNRIs were found. Venlafaxine (three studies) has an NNT of 3.1 (95% CI 2.2 to 5.1) RR 2.2 (95% CI 1.5 to 3.1). There were insufficient data to assess effectiveness for other antidepressants such as St Johns Wort and L-tryptophan. For diabetic neuropathy the NNT for effectiveness was 1.3 (95% CI 1.2 to 1.5) RR 12.4 (95% CI 5.2 to 29.2) (five studies); for postherpetic neuralgia 2.7 (95% CI 2 to 4.1), RR 2.2 (95% CI 1.6 to 3.1) (four studies). There was evidence that TCAs are not effective in HIV-related neuropathies. The number needed to harm (NNH) for major adverse effects defined as an event leading to withdrawal from a study was 28 (95% CI 17.6 to 68.9) for amitriptyline and 16.2 (95% CI 8 to 436) for venlafaxine. The NNH for minor adverse effects was 6 (95% CI 4.2 to 10.7) for amitriptyline and 9.6 (95% CI 3.5 to 13) for venlafaxine. This update has provided additional confirmation on the effectiveness of antidepressants for neuropathic pain and has provided new information on another antidepressant - venlafaxine. There is still limited evidence for the role of SSRIs. Whether antidepressants prevent the development of neuropathic pain (pre-emptive use) is still unclear. Both TCAs and venlafaxine have NNTs of approximately three. This means that for approximately every three patients with neuropathic pain who are treated with either of these antidepressants, one will get at least moderate pain relief. There is evidence to suggest that other antidepressants may be effective but numbers of participants are insufficient to calculate robust NNTs. SSRIs are generally better tolerated by patients and more high quality studies are required.",A Systematic Review concluded that tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are effective treatments for PHN.
"Does group prenatal care improve pregnancy outcomes
To examine the impact of group versus individual prenatal care on birth weight and gestational age. This prospective, matched cohort study included pregnant women (N = 458) entering prenatal care at 24 or less weeks' gestation; one half received group prenatal care with women of the same gestational age. Women were matched by clinic, age, race, parity, and infant birth date. Women were predominantly black and Hispanic of low socioeconomic status, served by one of three public clinics in Atlanta, Georgia or New Haven, Connecticut. Birth weight was greater for infants of women in group versus individual prenatal care (P < .01). Among those born preterm, infants of group patients were significantly larger than infants of individual-care patients (mean, 2398 versus 1990 g, P < .05). Although not statistically significant, infants of group patients were less likely than those of individual-care patients to be low birth weight (less than 2500 g; 16 versus 23 infants); very low birth weight (less than 1500 g; three versus six infants); early preterm (less than 33 weeks; two versus seven infants); or to experience neonatal loss (none versus three infants). There were no differences in number of prenatal visits or other risk characteristics (patient age, race, prior preterm birth). Group prenatal care results in higher birth weight, especially for infants delivered preterm. Group prenatal care provides a structural innovation, permitting more time for provider-patient interaction and therefore the opportunity to address clinical as well as psychological, social, and behavioral factors to promote healthy pregnancy. Results have implications for design of sustainable prenatal services that might contribute to reduction of racial disparities in adverse perinatal outcomes.",The matched cohort study recorded higher birth weights among infants born to mothers in group prenatal care. Subset analysis of preterm infants born to mothers in group care showed average birth weights approximately 400 g higher than those in individual care (P<.05).
"Which factors increase the risk of an infant becoming an overweight child
To identify factors in childhood which might influence the development of obesity in adulthood. The prevalence of obesity is increasing in the UK and other developed countries, in adults and children. The adverse health consequences of adult obesity are well documented, but are less certain for childhood obesity. An association between fatness in adolescence and undesirable socio-economic consequences, such as lower educational attainment and income, has been observed, particularly for women. Childhood factors implicated in the development of adult obesity therefore have far-reaching implications for costs to the health-services and economy. In order to identify relevant studies, electronic databases--Medline, Embase, CAB abstracts, Psyclit and Sport Discus-were searched from the start date of the database to Spring 1998. The general search structure for electronic databases was (childhood or synonyms) AND (fatness or synonyms) AND (longitudinal or synonyms). Further studies were identified by citations in retrieved papers and by consultation with experts. Longitudinal observational studies of healthy children which included measurement of a risk factor in childhood (<18 y), and outcome measure at least 1 y later. Any measure of fatness, leanness or change in fatness or leanness was accepted. Measures of fat distribution were not included. Only studies with participants from an industrialized country were considered, and those concerning minority or special groups, e.g. Pima Indians or children born preterm, were excluded. Risk factors for obesity included parental fatness, social factors, birth weight, timing or rate of maturation, physical activity, dietary factors and other behavioural or psychological factors. Offspring of obese parent(s) were consistently seen to be at increased risk of fatness, although few studies have looked at this relationship over longer periods of childhood and into adulthood. The relative contributions of genes and inherited lifestyle factors to the parent-child fatness association remain largely unknown. No clear relationship is reported between socio-economic status (SES) in early life and childhood fatness. However, a strong consistent relationship is observed between low SES in early life and increased fatness in adulthood. Studies investigating SES were generally large but very few considered confounding by parental fatness. Women who change social class (social mobility) show the prevalence of obesity of the class they join, an association which is not present in men. The influence of other social factors such as family size, number of parents at home and childcare have been little researched. There is good evidence from large and reasonably long-term studies for an apparently clear relationship for increased fatness with higher birth weight, but in studies which attempted to address potential confounding by gestational age, parental fatness, or social group, the relationship was less consistent. The relationship between earlier maturation and greater subsequent fatness was investigated in predominantly smaller, but also a few large studies. Again, this relationship appeared to be consistent, but in general, the studies had not investigated whether there was confounding by other factors, including parental fatness, SES, earlier fatness in childhood, or dietary or activity behaviours. Studies investigating the role of diet or activity were generally small, and included diverse methods of risk factor measurement. There was almost no evidence for an influence of activity in infancy on later fatness, and inconsistent but suggestive evidence for a protective effect of activity in childhood on later fatness. No clear evidence for an effect of infant feeding on later fatness emerged, but follow-up to adulthood was rare, with only one study measuring fatness after 7y. Studies investigating diet in childhood were limited and inconc",A meta-analysis found a positive association between birth weight and over-weight in childhood in 9 of 11 studies. This descriptive meta-analysis didn't calculate pooled odds ratios (ORs) because of heterogeneity of the ages included and methods used to measure obesity.
"What is the appropriate diagnostic evaluation of fibroids
To determine the accuracy of transvaginal ultrasonography, sonohysterography and diagnostic hysteroscopy for the investigation of abnormal uterine bleeding in premenopausal women. Systematic review of common diagnostic imaging tests. Relevant papers were identified through electronic searching of MEDLINE (1980 to July 2001) and EMBASE (1980 to July 2001) and manual searching of a bibliography of primary and review articles. Studies were selected if accuracy of transvaginal ultrasonography, sonohysterography and diagnostic hysteroscopy was compared with a reference standard and included data that could be abstracted into a two-by-two table in order to calculate sensitivity and specificity. Quality assessment and data extraction were performed by at least two independent reviewers. Diagnostic accuracy was determined by calculating positive and negative likelihood ratios for all intrauterine pathologies, submucous fibroids and endometrial hyperplasia. Nineteen studies met the inclusion criteria. Statistically significant heterogeneity was present between the likelihood ratios for studies of transvaginal ultrasound. A positive test result with sonohysterography diagnosed submucous fibroids with a pooled likelihood ratio of 29.7 (17.8, 49.6). A positive test result with hysteroscopy diagnosed submucous fibroids with a pooled likelihood ratio of 29.4 (13.4, 65.3), and any intrauterine pathology with a pooled likelihood ratio of 7.7 (4.3, 13.7). A negative test result with hysteroscopy for diagnosing any intrauterine pathology had a pooled likelihood ratio of 0.07 (0.04, 0.15). Although there was considerable variability present between the studies, all three diagnostic tests were moderately accurate in detecting intrauterine pathology. However, sonohysterography and hysteroscopy performed better than transvaginal ultrasound in detecting submucous fibroids.",A systematic review of 9 heterogeneous studies evaluating TVS found wide ranges for sensitivity and specificity.
"What is the appropriate diagnostic evaluation of fibroids
To evaluate saline infusion sonohysterography as an investigative modality in abnormal uterine bleeding in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women. Fifty-eight patients, 52 perimenopausal and six postmenopausal women, with abnormal uterine bleeding were selected from the department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of Shrimati Sucheta Kriplani Hospital. After complete work-ups, transvaginal examinations were performed followed by sonohysterographies. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values and negative predictive values were calculated for transvaginal sonography (TVS) and saline infusion sonohysterography as compared with findings of hysteroscopy/hysterectomy. Saline infusion sonohysterography was performed in 56 cases. It could not be done in one perimenopausal and one postmenopausal woman. Cavity was normal in 41 perimenopausal and five postmenopausal women. Ten women displayed abnormalities. Two had submucosal fibroids, two had intramural fibroids, one had fibroid polyp, three had endometrial polyps and two patients had endometrial growths. We found that TVS missed three endometrial polyps and one endometrial growth and led to mislabeling two intramural fibroids as submucosal. On comparing the sonohysterographic findings with those of hysteroscopy or hysterectomy, one endometrial polyp and one endocervical polyp was missed on sonohysterography, and one false positive growth was observed on sonohysterography. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and the negative predictive value of TVS were 84.8%, 79%, 82.4% and 82%, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and the negative predictive value of saline infusion sonohysterography were 94.1%, 88.5%, 91.4% and 92%, respectively. Saline infusion sonohysterography is a safe, convenient, time conserving, cost effective, easily accessible and acceptable investigative modality. It definitely enhances the diagnostic potential of TVS in assessment of endometrium and intracavitary pathologies.",SHG is more sensitive and specific than TVS in detecting submucous myomas and focal endometrial lesions.
"What is the appropriate diagnostic evaluation of fibroids
To correlate the preoperative bimanual examination with ultrasound examination with regard to estimating the size of enlarged nongravid leiomyomatous uteri. We performed a retrospective review of 161 patients who underwent hysterectomy for uterine leiomyoma between January 1994 and December 1994 and between July 1995 and April 1996. Uterine size was estimated clinically by bimanual examination. Ultrasound reports were reviewed. Uterine weights and dimensions in pathology reports were compared with findings on bimanual examination and ultrasonography. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated and patients were divided into two groups, one with BMIs of more than 30 and another with BMIs of less than or equal to 30. Ultrasound examination was ordered in 111 patients (68.9%) preoperatively. There was a strong correlation between the bimanual examination findings and the ultrasound dimensions. The equation for this relationship is ultrasound length (cm)=3.68 + 0.68 x number of weeks (r=.78, P < .001). Ultrasound length also was related strongly to size given in the pathologic reports; the equation for this relationship is ultrasound length (cm)=2.94 + 0.75 x pathology length (cm) (r=.73, P < .001). The correlation between bimanual examination and ultrasound findings was similar in obese and in nonobese patients, when uterine size could be estimated. There is a strong correlation between bimanual and ultrasound examinations with regard to determining the size of leiomyomatous uteri. Routine ultrasound is not indicated when an experienced examiner can assess uterine size. Ultrasonography may be appropriate when physical assessment is difficult, as in the case of obesity.","In a retrospective chart review of obese and nonobese patients with known uterine fibroids, clinical estimate of uterine size by bimanual examination correlated with both ultrasound fibroid sizing and posthysterectomy pathology analysis."
"What is the recommended evaluation and treatment for elevated serum prolactin
Hyperprolactinemia is the most common endocrine disorder of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. While it can occur in men, it occurs more commonly in women. The prevalence of hyperprolactinemia ranges from 0.4% in an unselected normal adult population to as high as 9-17% in women with reproductive disorders. There are many possible causes of hyperprolactinemia, falling into three general categories: physiologic, pharmacologic and pathologic. When specific treatable underlying causes have been eliminated and in cases of severe hyperprolactinemia, the most likely cause is a prolactin (PRL)-secreting pituitary adenoma. Microadenomas should be treated medically, with a dopamine agonist, if there is an indication for therapy (such as amenorrhea, infertility or bothersome galactorrhea). If there is no indication for therapy, microadenomas may be followed conservatively, as growth is uncommon. Macroadenomas may grow larger; medical therapy is recommended initially, with neurosurgical evaluation reserved for specific clinical situations, such as failure of medical therapy and evidence of mass effect despite medical therapy. In the United States, the dopamine agonists indicated for treatment of hyperprolactinemia are bromocriptine and cabergoline. Bromocriptine is usually given once or twice daily, while cabergoline has a long duration of action and is given once or twice weekly. Results of comparative studies indicate that cabergoline is clearly superior to bromocriptine in efficacy (PRL suppression, restoration of gonadal function) and tolerability.","An expert guideline recommends a history and physical examination to determine whether an elevated SPL is due to physiologic, pharmacologic, or pathologic causes. The fasting morning SPL is least variable and correlates best with a disease state. A detailed drug history is important since drug-induced elevated SPL is common.1 Laboratory evaluation includes thyroid-stimulating hormone, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine, as well as pregnancy testing when applicable. If no cause of elevated SPL is identified by initial clinical evaluation or if the SPL is greater than 200 ng/mL, experts recommend imaging of the sella turcica with computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging."

When specific treatable underlying causes have been eliminated and in cases of severe hyperprolactinemia, the most likely cause is a prolactin (PRL)-secreting pituitary adenoma. Microadenomas should be treated medically, with a dopamine agonist, if there is an indication for therapy (such as amenorrhea, infertility or bothersome galactorrhea). If there is no indication for therapy, microadenomas may be followed conservatively, as growth is uncommon. Macroadenomas may grow larger; medical therapy is recommended initially, with neurosurgical evaluation reserved for specific clinical situations, such as failure of medical therapy and evidence of mass effect despite medical therapy. In the United States, the dopamine agonists indicated for treatment of hyperprolactinemia are bromocriptine and cabergoline. Bromocriptine is usually given once or twice daily, while cabergoline has a long duration of action and is given once or twice weekly. Results of comparative studies indicate that cabergoline is clearly superior to bromocriptine in efficacy (PRL suppression, restoration of gonadal function) and tolerability.","If no cause of elevated SPL is identified by initial clinical evaluation or if the SPL is greater than 200 ng/mL, experts recommend imaging of the sella turcica with computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging."
"What is the recommended evaluation and treatment for elevated serum prolactin
Hyperprolactinemia is the most common endocrine disorder of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. While it can occur in men, it occurs more commonly in women.

"What is the recommended evaluation and treatment for elevated serum prolactin
Cabergoline is a long-acting dopamine-agonist drug that suppresses prolactin secretion and restores gonadal function in women with hyperprolactinemic amenorrhea. We designed a study to compare its safety and efficacy with those of bromocriptine, which has been the standard therapy. A total of 459 women with hyperprolactinemic amenorrhea were treated with either cabergoline (0.5 to 1.0 mg twice weekly) or bromocriptine (2.5 to 5.0 mg twice daily), administered in a double-blind fashion for 8 weeks and subsequently in an open fashion for 16 weeks, during which adjustments in the dose were made according to the response. Of the 459 women, 279 had microprolactinomas, 3 had macroprolactinomas, 1 had a craniopharyngioma, 167 had idiopathic hyperprolactinemia, and the remainder had an empty sella. Clinical and biochemical status was assessed at 2-week intervals for 8 weeks and monthly thereafter for a total of 6 months, with an additional assessment at 14 weeks. Stable normoprolactinemia was achieved in 186 of the 223 women treated with cabergoline (83 percent) and 138 of the 236 women treated with bromocriptine (59 percent, P < 0.001). Seventy-two percent of the women treated with cabergoline and 52 percent of those treated with bromocriptine had ovulatory cycles or became pregnant during treatment (P < 0.001). Amenorrhea persisted in 7 percent of the cabergoline-treated women and 16 percent of the bromocriptine-treated women. Adverse effects were recorded in 68 percent of the women taking cabergoline and 78 percent of those taking bromocriptine (P = 0.03); 3 percent discontinued taking cabergoline, and 12 percent stopped taking bromocriptine (P < 0.001) because of drug intolerance. Gastrointestinal symptoms were significantly less frequent, less severe, and shorter-lived in the women treated with cabergoline. Cabergoline is more effective and better tolerated than bromocriptine in women with hyperprolactinemic amenorrhea.","A randomized controlled trial treating 459 women having hyperprolactinemic amenorrhea with either cabergoline or bromocriptine achieved a stable normal SPL in 83% and 59%, respectively (P<.001). Adverse effects were common but were less common with cabergoline (68% vs 78%) and resulted in fewer discontinuations (3% vs 12%)."
"Which healthy adults should take aspirin
The use of aspirin to prevent cardiovascular disease events in patients without a history of cardiovascular disease is controversial. To examine the benefits and harms of aspirin chemoprevention. MEDLINE (1966 to May 2001). 1) Randomized trials at least 1 year in duration that examined aspirin chemoprevention in patients without previously known cardiovascular disease and 2) systematic reviews, recent trials, and observational studies that examined rates of hemorrhagic strokes and gastrointestinal bleeding secondary to aspirin use. One reviewer read and extracted data from each included article and constructed evidence tables. A second reviewer checked the accuracy of the data extraction. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus. Meta-analysis was performed, and the quantitative results of the review were then used to model the consequences of treating patients with different levels of baseline risk for coronary heart disease. Five trials examined the effect of aspirin on cardiovascular events in patients with no previous cardiovascular disease. For patients similar to those enrolled in the trials, aspirin reduces the risk for the combined end point of nonfatal myocardial infarction and fatal coronary heart disease (summary odds ratio, 0.72 [95% CI, 0.60 to 0.87]). Aspirin increased the risk for hemorrhagic strokes (summary odds ratio, 1.4 [CI, 0.9 to 2.0]) and major gastrointestinal bleeding (summary odds ratio, 1.7 [CI, 1.4 to 2.1]). All-cause mortality (summary odds ratio, 0.93 [CI, 0.84 to 1.02]) was not significantly affected. For 1000 patients with a 5% risk for coronary heart disease events over 5 years, aspirin would prevent 6 to 20 myocardial infarctions but would cause 0 to 2 hemorrhagic strokes and 2 to 4 major gastrointestinal bleeding events. For patients with a risk of 1% over 5 years, aspirin would prevent 1 to 4 myocardial infarctions but would cause 0 to 2 hemorrhagic strokes and 2 to 4 major gastrointestinal bleeding events. The net benefit of aspirin increases with increasing cardiovascular risk. In the decision to use aspirin chemoprevention, the patient's cardiovascular risk and relative utility for the different clinical outcomes prevented or caused by aspirin use must be considered.","Aspirin increased the risk of major gastrointestinal bleeding events by almost twofold (OR=1.70; 95% CI, 1.4-2.1). Three of the 5 trials showed no significant increase of intracranial hemorrhage event rates (OR=1.4; 95% CI, 0.9-2.0). Based on combined primary and secondary prevention trials, the risk of intracranial bleeding with aspirin is estimated at 0 to 2 events per 1000 patients per year."
"How much does smoking cessation cut CHD risk
To examine whether midlife cardiovascular risk factors predict survival and survival free of major comorbidities to the age of 85. Prospective community-based cohort study. Framingham Heart Study, Massachusetts. Two thousand five hundred thirty-one individuals (1,422 women) who attended at least two examinations between the ages of 40 and 50. Risk factors were classified at routine examinations performed between the ages of 40 and 50. Stepwise sex-adjusted logistic regression models predicting the outcomes of survival and survival free of morbidity to age 85 were selected from the following risk factors: systolic and diastolic blood pressure, total serum cholesterol, glucose intolerance, cigarette smoking, education, body mass index, physical activity index, pulse pressure, antihypertensive medication, and electrocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy. More than one-third of the study sample survived to age 85, and 22% of the original study sample survived free of morbidity. Lower midlife blood pressure and total cholesterol levels, absence of glucose intolerance, nonsmoking status, higher educational attainment, and female sex predicted overall and morbidity-free survival. The predicted probability of survival to age 85 fell in the presence of accumulating risk factors: 37% for men with no risk factors to 2% with all five risk factors and 65% for women with no risk factors to 14% with all five risk factors. Lower levels of key cardiovascular risk factors in middle age predicted overall survival and major morbidity-free survival to age 85. Recognizing and modifying these factors may delay, if not prevent, age-related morbidity and mortality.","The landmark prospective, community-based cohort Framingham Heart Study (N=1422), which indicates that smoking status predicts overall and morbidity-free survival at age 85."
"What is the best treatment for Osgood-Schlatter disease
During the period of 1976 to 1981, a total of 412 young athletes contacted the Turku Sports Medical Research Unit's (TSMRU) Outpatient Sports Clinic with 586 complaints. These records included 68 athletes with Osgood-Schlatter's disease (OSD), who were initially prescribed an average of 2 months' rest from any physical activity causing pain. Symptoms of tibial tuberosity pain occurred first at the average age of 13.1 years. According to the retrospective questionnaire, the pain caused complete cessation of training for an average of 3.2 months, and the disease interfered with fully effective training for an average of 7.3 months. According to a retrospective questionnaire given to 389 students (191 girls and 198 boys), 50 (12.9%) had suffered from OSD. Nearly one-half of the students, 193 (49.6%), had been active in sports at the age of 13, and 41 (21.2%) of them had suffered from OSD. In those students who were not active in sports, the incidence was only nine (4.5%; P less than 0.001). The incidence (32%) was higher in the siblings of the OSD patients of TSMRU who were active in sports than in the corresponding student group (21.2%). In a group of 22 patients from the TSMRU who had suffered from Sever's disease (calcaneal apophysitis), the incidence of OSD (68%) was significantly higher than in students who were active in sports (P less than 0.001).",One retrospective survey of 68 young athletes with Osgood-Schlatter found they required an average of 3.2 months off all training and 7.3 months of some activity restrictions.
"Should you treat carriers of pharyngeal group A strep
A 4-year longitudinal study of school-aged children was conducted to describe the clinical characteristics and epidemiologic features of infections with group A streptococci (GAS). Between 1998 and 2002, surveillance throat cultures were performed twice per month (October to May) for a cohort of elementary school children in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In addition, throat cultures were obtained during any respiratory illness. Erythromycin and clindamycin susceptibility testing was performed for all isolates. Molecular typing was performed with field-inversion gel electrophoresis. Representative isolates from each field-inversion gel electrophoresis group were emm typed. Strict definitions were used to characterize each GAS infection. Children were classified into 4 categories each year, ie, single episode, recurrent episodes, carriers of GAS, and no infections. A total of 48 to 100 children per year were studied for 4 years; 61 (49%) were male. The mean age was 9.6 years (range: 5-15 years). A total of 5658 throat cultures were performed; 878 (15.5%) were positive for GAS. Antimicrobial agents were used to treat 209 episodes of infection. Thirteen emm types were observed during the 4-year period. GAS were isolated most often from children who were carriers; isolates from single episodes were next most common. Children carried a single emm type for a mean of 10.8 weeks (range: 3-34 weeks). Carriers were likely to be classified again as carriers in subsequent years and frequently switched emm types. Sixty-two percent of the children had > or =1 year with no infections. GAS infections are common among school-aged children. The majority of positive throat cultures observed in this longitudinal study were obtained from children who were carriers of GAS. Carriers switched emm types but tended to become carriers repeatedly during the study. Practitioners should consider treating children known to be GAS carriers when they develop a new illness that is consistent with streptococcal pharyngitis, because they may acquire new emm types and be at risk for rheumatic heart disease.","Some experts practicing in areas with a high prevalence of acute rheumatic fever take a different position: They favor routine treatment of patients with active pharyngitis and a positive throat culture, even if the patient is a known GAS carrier."
"Should you treat carriers of pharyngeal group A strep
We evaluated the efficacy of rifampin in eradicating chronic pharyngeal carriage of group A streptococci. Carriers were defined as healthy children whose throat cultures showed persistence of group A streptococci 3 weeks after receiving benzathine penicillin G intramuscularly. Subsequent M and T typing of group A streptococcal isolates and limited serologic studies confirmed that enrolled patients were carriers. Thirty-eight carriers (37 completed the study) were randomly assigned to three groups: group 1 (13 patients) received no treatment; group 2 (10) received benzathine penicillin intramuscularly; group 3 (14) received benzathine penicillin intramuscularly plus rifampin orally (10 mg/kg twice a day for eight doses). Throat cultures were obtained every 3 weeks for at least 9 weeks. Group 2 and 3 patients who still had positive cultures 3 weeks after treatment were crossed to the opposite group. Cultures became negative in 93% (13 of 14) of patients in group 3, compared with 23% in group 1 and 30% in group 2 (P less than 0.001 and P less than 0.01, respectively). Including patients crossed over, the penicillin plus rifampin regimen was effective in 17 (89%) of 19 treatment courses and was significantly superior to no therapy or to penicillin alone (P less than 0.0005 and P less than 0.005, respectively). We conclude that rifampin plus benzathine penicillin intramuscularly is an effective regimen for those selected patients in whom eradication of group A streptococcal carriage is judged to be desirable.",As many as 25% of patients with GAS pharyngitis remain culture-positive after an adequate regimen of antibiotic therapy and are deemed GAS carriers. Appropriate screening and management of asymptomatic carriers continues to cause confusion.
"Should you treat carriers of pharyngeal group A strep
We previously demonstrated that chronic pharyngeal carriage of group A beta-hemolytic streptococci (GABHS) can be terminated by intramuscular administration of benzathine penicillin plus 4 days of orally administered rifampin. Because an effective oral regimen would be desirable, we compared clindamycin with P + R for treating GABHS carriage. Healthy, symptom-free GABHS carriers were randomly assigned to receive orally administered clindamycin (20 mg/kg per day) three times a day for 10 days or intramuscularly administered benzathine penicillin with oral doses of rifampin (20 mg/kg per day) twice a day for 4 days. Compliance was documented by antibiotic activity in urine. Throat cultures for GABHS were obtained every 3 weeks for up to 9 weeks after treatment. Patients who had positive throat cultures for their original GABHS T type 3 weeks after randomization were crossed over to the other treatment. Treatment success was defined as eradication of the original GABHS T type, with all follow-up cultures negative. Clindamycin eradicated carriage in 24 (92%) of 26 patients; penicillin plus rifampin was effective in 12 (55%) of 22 patients (p less than 0.025). Including patients crossed over 3 weeks after enrollment, clindamycin was effective in 28 (85%) of 33 treatment courses compared with 12 of 22 courses of penicillin plus rifampin (p less than 0.05). We conclude that 10 days of oral clindamycin therapy was significantly more effective than benzathine penicillin plus 4 days of orally administered rifampin for treatment of symptom-free GABHS carriers.","A study demonstrated a significantly greater eradication rate with oral clindamycin than penicillin plus rifampin (P<.025). Compared with penicillin plus rifampin after 3 weeks of therapy, the number needed to treat (NNT) for clindamycin was 4."
"How should you treat Candida vaginitis in patients on antibiotics
Anti-fungals are available for oral and intra-vaginal treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis (thrush). The primary objective of this review was to assess the relative effectiveness of oral versus intra-vaginal anti-fungals for the treatment of uncomplicated vulvovaginal candidiasis. The secondary objectives of the review were to assess the cost-effectiveness, safety and patient preference of oral versus intra-vaginal anti-fungals. The following sources were searched: The Cochrane Library (Issue 4, 1999), MEDLINE (January 1985 to May 2000), EMBASE (January 1980 to January 2000) and the Cochrane Collaboration Sexually Transmitted Disease Group Specialised Register of Controlled Trials. The reference lists of retrieved articles were reviewed manually. The manufacturers of anti-fungals available in the UK were contacted. ~Bullet~Randomised controlled trials published in any language. ~Bullet~Trials had to compare at least one oral anti-fungal with one intra-vaginal anti-fungal. ~Bullet~Women (aged 16 years or over) with uncomplicated vulvovaginal candidiasis. ~Bullet~The diagnosis of vulvovaginal candidiasis to be made mycologically (i.e. a positive culture and / or microscopy for yeast). ~Bullet~Trials were excluded if they solely involved subjects who were HIV positive, immunocompromised, pregnant, breastfeeding or diabetic. ~Bullet~The primary outcome measure was clinical cure. Duplicate scrutiny was performed of the titles and abstracts of the electronic search results. Full article formats of all selected abstracts were retrieved and independently assessed by two reviewers. Independent duplicate abstraction was performed by four reviewers. Disagreements regarding trial inclusion or data abstraction were resolved by discussion between the reviewers. Odds ratios were pooled using the random effects model. Chi-squared tests with a p-value of less than 0.1 indicated heterogeneity in the results. Seventeen trials are included in the review, reporting 19 oral versus intra-vaginal anti-fungal comparisons. No statistically significant differences were shown between oral and intra-vaginal anti-fungal treatment for clinical cure at short term (OR 1.00 (95% CI, 0.72 to 1.40)) and long term (OR 1.03 (95% CI, 0.72 to 1.49)) follow-up. No statistically significant differences for mycological cure were observed between oral and intra-vaginal treatment at short term (OR 1.20(95% CI, 0.87 to 1.65)) or long term follow-up (OR 1.30 (95% CI, 0.99 to 1.71)). Two trials each reported one withdrawal from treatment due to an adverse reaction. Treatment preference data were poorly reported. No differences exist in terms of the relative effectiveness (measured as clinical and mycological cure) of anti-fungals administered by the oral and intra-vaginal routes for the treatment of uncomplicated vaginal candidiasis. No definitive conclusion can be made regarding the relative safety of oral and intra-vaginal anti-fungals for uncomplicated vaginal candidiasis. The oral route of administration is the preferred route for anti-fungals for the treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis. The decision to prescribe or recommend the purchase of an anti-fungal for oral or intra-vaginal administration should take into consideration: safety, cost and treatment preference. Unless there is a previous history of adverse reaction to one route of administration or contraindications: if women are purchasing their own treatment, they should be given full information about the characteristics and costs of treatment to make their own decision. If health services are paying the treatment cost, decision-makers should consider whether the higher cost of oral anti-fungal administration is worth the gain in convenience, if this is the patient's preference.","For the treatment of uncomplicated VVC, both topical and oral antifungals are clinically and mycologically effective, with comparable clinical cure rates >80%. No difference in persistent symptoms between single and multiple doses, or different durations of multiple dose regimens have been found, but samples may have been too small to detect clinically significant effects. An RCT found less nausea, headache, and abdominal pain with intravaginal imidazoles, but more vulvar irritation and vaginal discharge than oral fluconazole."

Alterations in the autochthonous vaginal microflora can predispose women to recurring attacks of Candida vaginitis. Quantitative aerobic and anaerobic cultures were obtained from 24 premenopausal women with acute recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis and from 21 healthy asymptomatic premenopausal women. Lactobacillus species constituted the predominant flora in both groups, with a mean log10 CFU/ml of 8.7, a total isolation rate of 96%, and a mean of 1.6 Lactobacillus species isolated per patient compared with a mean log10 CFU/ml of 8.9, a total isolation rate of 90%, and a mean of 1.2 Lactobacillus species isolated per patient in the vaginitis and control groups, respectively. The results of this small study failed to provide evidence of an altered or abnormal vaginal bacterial flora in women with non-antibiotic-induced recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis suffering from acute Candida vaginitis.",There is evidence that numbers of genital Lactobacillus are similar for women with and without symptomatic VVC.
"What's the best drug treatment for premature ejaculation
The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to evaluate whether the design and methodology of drug-treatment studies of premature ejaculation affect the efficacy outcome differently. Therefore, methodological, design and efficacy data from 79 studies (3034 males), published between 1943 and 2003, are reviewed. A meta-analysis is performed on 43 selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and clomipramine studies (1514 males), published between 1973 and 2003; these studies were pooled to provide a summary variance-weighted effect size. The antidepressant-induced percentage increase of the intravaginal ejaculation latency time (IELT) was calculated and examined against various methodological items. A significant difference in efficacy between SSRIs was observed. Using daily treatment, paroxetine appeared more effective than the other SSRIs. Retrospective use of a questionnaire, subjective reports, single-blind and open study designs generate far greater variability of ejaculation time both at baseline and during active drug treatment than real time assessment by stopwatch. In conclusion, at daily treatment, the overall efficacy of paroxetine, clomipramine, sertraline and fluoxetine is comparable, but paroxetine exerts the strongest ejaculation delay. Only eight (18.5%) studies on antidepressant treatment fulfilled all criteria used in evidence-based medicine, for example, randomised, double-blind studies with prospective real time (stopwatch) assessment of the IELT at each intercourse. Single-blind studies, open designs, retrospective reporting, or the use of a questionnaire to assess ejaculation time should be avoided.",Certain SSRIs and the tricyclic antidepressant clomipramine (Anafranil) have become the agents of choice for the treatment of premature ejaculation.
"What's the best drug treatment for premature ejaculation
Premature ejaculation is a common male sexual disorder in which orgasm and ejaculation occur before the desired moment. The primary therapeutic approach to premature ejaculation has been behavioural and pharmacotherapy. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy and optimum usage of lidocaine-prilocaine cream 5% in preventing premature ejaculation. Forty patients were examined in the study group and randomized into four groups, each comprising 10 patients. Patients in group 1 applied lidocaine-prilocaine cream 5% for 20 min, the patients in group 2 applied it for 30 min, and the patients in group 3 applied the cream for 45 min before sexual contact, with all patients covering the penis with a condom. Patients in the fourth group applied a base cream as placebo. In group 1, the pre-ejaculation period increased to 6.71 +/- 2.54 min without any adverse effects. In group 2, although the pre-ejaculation period increased in four patients up to 8.70 +/- 1.70 min, six patients in this group and all patients in group 3 had erection loss because of numbness. In the placebo group, there was no change in their pre-ejaculation period. Therefore, lidocaine-prilocaine cream 5% is effective in premature ejaculation and 20 min of application time before sexual contact is the optimum period.","One small RCT (N=24) compared placebo with the application of EMLA cream 20, 30, and 45 minutes prior to sexual intercourse. Improvement was seen in IELT in the 20- and 30-minute group, but penile numbness and erection loss increased in the 30- and 45-minute group."
"What's the best drug treatment for premature ejaculation
This review examines the role of nitric oxide (NO) as a neurotransmitter involved in the central and peripheral control of ejaculation, the methods of phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor (PDE5I) drug treatment studies for premature ejaculation (PE), the adherence of methods to the contemporary consensus of ideal PE drug trial design, the impact of methods on treatment outcomes and the role of PDE5Is in the treatment of PE. NO/cGMP transduction is involved in both the central and peripheral control of emission, but evidence for a direct central or peripheral effect of PDE5Is on ejaculation is speculative. Thirteen of the 14 studies reviewed failed to fulfil the evidence-based medicine criteria for ideal PE drug trial design. Limitations of the studies include inadequately defined study populations, the lack of a double-blind placebo-controlled study design, and the absence of consistent objective physiological measures or sensitive, validated outcome assessment instruments as study endpoints. The broad range of intravaginal ejaculatory latency time (IELT) fold-increases reported with PDE5Is, on-demand selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor (SSRI) drugs, and combined PDE5I/on-demand SSRIs is testament to the unreliability of data and conclusions from methodologically flawed studies. The one study that fulfilled the evidence-based medicine criteria of an ideal clinical trial design reported that treatment with sildenafil failed to significantly increase baseline IELT, supporting our conclusion that there is no convincing evidence to support any role for PDE5Is in the treatment of men with lifelong PE and normal erectile function. However, there is limited evidence to support a potential role for PDE5Is alone or combined with daily or on-demand SSRIs in the treatment of acquired PE in men with comorbid erectile dysfunction. Further controlled studies adhering to the contemporary consensus of ideal clinical trial design are required to clarify the role of PDE5Is in this subgroup of men with acquired PE.",A review of 14 clinical trials concluded that there is no convincing evidence for PDE5 inhibitors in the treatment of men with lifelong premature ejaculation and normal erectile function.

8-Methoxy-2-(di-n-propylamino) tetralin (8-OMe-DPAT) and 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino) tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) are two new drugs exerting selective actions on brain 5-HT neurotransmission. In the present experiments we have investigated the effects of these two drugs on male rat sexual behavior. It was found that both drugs reduce the number of intromissions preceding ejaculation and shorten the ejaculation latency. These effects are extremely pronounced and several animals ejaculate at the first intromission. In addition 8-OH-DPAT produced a slight reduction of the post-ejaculatory interval. There were no significant effects on latency to initiate copulation or in the number of mounts preceding ejaculation. Finally, sexual behavior was partly or completely restored in castrated male rats after injection with 8-OMe-DPAT or 8-OH-DPAT.",Studies in male rats have demonstrated that serotonin with various 5-HT receptor subtypes are involved in the ejaculatory process.
"What's the best drug treatment for premature ejaculation
The introduction of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) has revolutionized our understanding of the treatment of premature ejaculation. Lifelong premature ejaculation may be a neurobiological phenomenon, namely part of a biological variability of the intravaginal ejaculation latency time in men. Animal studies support this view, and an animal model for premature and delayed ejaculation has recently been developed. It is proposed that drug treatment of premature ejaculation should consist of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)2c receptor stimulation and/or 5-HT1A receptor inhibition. A meta-analysis of 35 daily treatment studies with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and clomipramine demonstrated comparable efficacy of clomipramine with the SSRIs sertraline and fluoxetine in delaying ejaculation, whereas the efficacy of the SSRI paroxetine was greater than all other SSRIs and clomipramine. It is postulated that acute treatment with SSRIs, including those with short half-lives, will not produce an ejaculation delay equivalent to that induced by daily treatment of SSRIs.",The introduction of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) revolutionized the treatment of premature ejaculation.
"Is osteopathic manipulation effective for headaches
Non-invasive physical treatments are often used to treat common types of chronic/recurrent headache. To quantify and compare the magnitude of short- and long-term effects of non-invasive physical treatments for chronic/recurrent headaches. We searched the following databases from their inception to November 2002: MEDLINE, EMBASE, BIOSIS, CINAHL, Science Citation Index, Dissertation Abstracts, CENTRAL, and the Specialised Register of the Cochrane Pain, Palliative Care and Supportive Care review group. Selected complementary medicine reference systems were searched as well. We also performed citation tracking and hand searching of potentially relevant journals. We included randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials comparing non-invasive physical treatments for chronic/recurrent headaches to any type of control. Two independent reviewers abstracted trial information and scored trials for methodological quality. Outcomes data were standardized into percentage point and effect size scores wherever possible. The strength of the evidence of effectiveness was assessed using pre-specified rules. Twenty-two studies with a total of 2628 patients (age 12 to 78 years) met the inclusion criteria. Five types of headache were studied: migraine, tension-type, cervicogenic, a mix of migraine and tension-type, and post-traumatic headache. Ten studies had methodological quality scores of 50 or more (out of a possible 100 points), but many limitations were identified. We were unable to pool data because of study heterogeneity. For the prophylactic treatment of migraine headache, there is evidence that spinal manipulation may be an effective treatment option with a short-term effect similar to that of a commonly used, effective drug (amitriptyline). Other possible treatment options with weaker evidence of effectiveness are pulsating electromagnetic fields and a combination of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation [TENS] and electrical neurotransmitter modulation. For the prophylactic treatment of chronic tension-type headache, amitriptyline is more effective than spinal manipulation during treatment. However, spinal manipulation is superior in the short term after cessation of both treatments. Other possible treatment options with weaker evidence of effectiveness are therapeutic touch; cranial electrotherapy; a combination of TENS and electrical neurotransmitter modulation; and a regimen of auto-massage, TENS, and stretching. For episodic tension-type headache, there is evidence that adding spinal manipulation to massage is not effective. For the prophylactic treatment of cervicogenic headache, there is evidence that both neck exercise (low-intensity endurance training) and spinal manipulation are effective in the short and long term when compared to no treatment. There is also evidence that spinal manipulation is effective in the short term when compared to massage or placebo spinal manipulation, and weaker evidence when compared to spinal mobilization. There is weaker evidence that spinal mobilization is more effective in the short term than cold packs in the treatment of post-traumatic headache. A few non-invasive physical treatments may be effective as prophylactic treatments for chronic/recurrent headaches. Based on trial results, these treatments appear to be associated with little risk of serious adverse effects. The clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of non-invasive physical treatments require further research using scientifically rigorous methods. The heterogeneity of the studies included in this review means that the results of a few additional high-quality trials in the future could easily change the conclusions of our review.","A trial randomized 30 patients to either SMT, mobilization (small oscillatory movements to a joint within its normal range), or wait-list placement. At the end of treatment, there was a nonsignificant trend toward greater pain reduction in patients receiving SMT than either those receiving mobilization (ES=0.4; 95% CI, -0.5 to 1.4) or those on the wait list (ES=0.6; 95% CI, -0.4 to 1.5)."

To determine the effectiveness of manipulative therapy and a low-load exercise program for cervicogenic headache when used alone and in combination, as compared with a control group. Headaches arising from cervical musculoskeletal disorders are common. Conservative therapies are recommended as the first treatment of choice. Evidence for the effectiveness of manipulative therapy is inconclusive and available only for the short term. There is no evidence for exercise, and no study has investigated the effect of combined therapies for cervicogenic headache. In this study, 200 participants who met the diagnostic criteria for cervicogenic headache were randomized into four groups: manipulative therapy group, exercise therapy group, combined therapy group, and a control group. The primary outcome was a change in headache frequency. Other outcomes included changes in headache intensity and duration, the Northwick Park Neck Pain Index, medication intake, and patient satisfaction. Physical outcomes included pain on neck movement, upper cervical joint tenderness, a craniocervical flexion muscle test, and a photographic measure of posture. There were no differences in headache-related and demographic characteristics between the groups at baseline. The loss to follow-up evaluation was 3.5%. At the 12-month follow-up assessment, both manipulative therapy and specific exercise had significantly reduced headache frequency and intensity, and the neck pain and effects were maintained (P < 0.05 for all). The combined therapies was not significantly superior to either therapy alone, but 10% more patients gained relief with the combination. Effect sizes were at least moderate and clinically relevant. Manipulative therapy and exercise can reduce the symptoms of cervicogenic headache, and the effects are maintained.","A multicenter trial randomized 200 patients with cervicogenic headaches to either SMT (8-12 sessions over 6 weeks) or placebo. The SMT group had significantly reduced pain (at 1 week, effect size [ES]=0.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.3-1.2; and at 12 months, ES=0.4; 95% CI, 0.0-0.8) and fewer headaches (ES=0.7; 95% CI, 0.3-1.1 at both time points) than placebo."
"What are the causes of elevated TSH in a newborn
The Dutch T(4)-TSH-TBG-based neonatal screening program detects patients with congenital hypothyroidism (CH) of thyroidal (CH-T) as well as central (CH-C) origin. The numbers and characteristics of true-positive and false-positive referrals will differ from other, predominantly TSH-based, screening methods. The present study describes the characteristics of the referred neonates, both CH patients and false positives, and of the reported CH patients with a false-negative screening result born in the study period. DESIGN, SETTING, PATIENTS, AND MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: For each referred child born between April 1, 2002, and May 31, 2004, screening results and first venous sample results were recorded and classified as transient or permanent CH-T or CH-C or as no CH. In the study period, 430,764 children were screened. Of the 772 children with abnormal screening results, 224 (29%) had CH; another 13 CH patients did not have abnormal screening results, giving an overall CH incidence of 1:1800. Incidences of permanent CH, permanent CH-T, permanent CH-C, and transient CH were 1:2200, 1:2500, 1:21,000, and 1:12,000, respectively. The most frequent explanations for the 548 false-positive referrals (71% of the referred cohort) were severe illness and TBG deficiency (occurring in 198 and 200 children, respectively). The Dutch incidence figures for CH belong to the highest worldwide, suggesting that the T(4)-TSH-TBG screening program is an efficient method to detect CH of variable etiology and severity. Still, a small percentage of children with CH escaped detection via this screening approach. Severe illness and TBG deficiency appear to be responsible for the majority of false-positive referrals.","A study explored the presumed causes of elevated TSH among children who were diagnosed with transient hypothyroidism (initially elevated TSH level found to be normal on follow-up testing). The most common causes were thyroid-binding globulin deficiency (200/548 or 36% of newborns with transient hypothyroidism), severe illness (36%), prematurity (8%), and errors in screening procedures (4%). The study found that of 34 children with transient hypothyroidism, 10 had mothers with undertreated or unrecognized Graves disease."
"How does colonoscopy compare with fecal occult blood testing as a screening tool for colon cancer
Colorectal cancer is a leading cause of illness and death in the Western world. In Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States, it is the second commonest cancer for women after breast cancer (age-standardised incidence 22-33 per 100,000), and men after prostate or lung cancer (age-standardised incidence 31-47 per 100,000) (Jeffs et al, 1996; Parkin et al, 1992). Just under half of all persons affected will die from their disease (Jeffs et al, 1996; Parkin et al, 1992) The human and financial costs of this disease have prompted considerable research efforts to evaluate the ability of screening tests to detect the cancer at an early curable stage. Tests which have been considered for screening include faecal occult blood tests, sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy. To determine whether screening for colorectal cancer using the faecal occult blood test, Hemoccult reduces colorectal cancer mortality and to consider the benefits and harms of screening. Published and unpublished data for this review were identified by: * retrieving studies included in a systematic review conducted by some of the authors in 1995, * searches of MEDLINE, Current Contents and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, * writing to trial lists. All controlled trials of screening for colorectal cancer using Hemoccult were eligible for inclusion in the review. Data from the trials were independently extracted by two authors. Data analysis was performed using the group subjects were randomised to ('intention to screen'), whether or not they were ever screened. To estimate the effect of Hemoccult screening on colorectal cancer mortality, we calculated relative risks and risk differences for each trial, and then overall, using fixed and random effects models and tested for heterogeneity of effects. We calculated summary measures of effect including all trials and also for just the randomised controlled trials. We also calculated a summary measure of effect, adjusted for attendance at screening in each trial (not shown in Meta-view). Meta-analysis of mortality results from the randomised controlled trials shows that those allocated to screening had a reduction in colorectal cancer mortality of 16% (RR 0.84, CI: 0.77-0.93). When adjusted for screening attendance in the individual studies, the mortality reduction is 23% (RR 0.77, CI: 0.57-0.89). Overall, if 10 000 people were offered a biennial Hemoccult screening program and two-thirds attended for at least one Hemoccult test, there would be 8.5 deaths (CI: 3.6-13.5) from colorectal cancer prevented over 10 years. However, the screening program would also result in 2 800 participants having at least one colonoscopy, if screening harms from the Minnesota trial are considered, and there would be 3.4 colonoscopy complications (perforation or haemorrhage). If screening harms from the Gothenburg trial are considered, approximately 600 participants would need at least one sigmoidoscopy and double contrast barium enema, resulting in 1.8 perforations or haemorrhages. Screening benefits include reduction in colorectal cancer mortality, possible reduction in cancer incidence through detection and removal of colorectal adenomas and potentially, treatment of early colorectal cancers may involve less invasive surgery. Harmful effects of screening include the physical complications of colonoscopy, disruption to lifestyle, stress and discomfort of testing and investigations, and the anxiety caused by falsely positive screening tests. Although screening benefits are likely to outweigh harms for populations at increased risk of colorectal cancer, we need more information about the harmful effects of screening, the community's responses to screening and screening costs for different health care systems before widespread screening can be recommended.","A Cochrane review conducted a meta-analysis looking only at FOBT for colorectal cancer screening. This review, based on published and unpublished data from 5 controlled trials, demonstrated that 3-card home FOBT conferred a reduction in colorectal cancer mortality of 16% (relative risk [RR]=0.84; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.77-0.92) and a number needed to screen of 1173 (95% CI, 741-2807) to prevent 1 death from colon cancer over a 10-year period. If adjusted for adherence to screening, the reduction in mortality increased to 23% (RR=0.77; 95% CI, 0.57-0.89)."
"How can we best treat and monitor VTE during pregnancy
Venous thromboembolism remains an important cause of maternal mortality. For women at risk during pregnancy, the recommended venous thromboembolismprophylaxis is unfractionated heparin. Low molecular weight heparins, such as dalteparin, also may be suitable, but randomised trials have not been performed. Pregnant women (105) with confirmed previous or current thromboembolism were randomised to receive either unfractionated heparin twice daily (mean 20569 IU/day) or dalteparin once daily (mean 4631 IU anti-factor Xa units/day) subcutaneously for thromboprophylaxis during pregnancy and postpartum period. Recurrence of venous thromboembolism and safety of treatments were assessed. Dalteparin administered once daily was safe and effective in thromboprophylaxis during pregnancy and postpartum.","One randomized controlled trial compared unfractionated with low-molecular-weight heparin for VTE prophylaxis among 107 high-risk pregnant patients. The unfractionated heparin group received 7500 IU subcutaneously twice daily adjusted to aPTT levels, while the dalteparin group received weight-adjusted doses to target antifactor Xa levels >0.2 IU/mL at 3 hours. No thromboembolic complications occurred in either group (95% confidence interval, 0 to 2 in both groups). Minor bleeding complications were significantly more common with unfractionated heparin than with low-molecular-weight heparin. Two bleeds requiring transfusion and 2 lumbosacral compression fractures were also observed in the unfractionated heparin group, compared with none in the dalteparin group (difference not statistically significant)."
"How can we best treat and monitor VTE during pregnancy
Low-molecular-weight (LMW) heparins have been shown to be at least as effective as unfractionated (UF) heparin in the treatment of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in nonpregnant subjects. LMW heparins have been shown to be safe when used during pregnancy as they do not cross the placenta. Up to now, they have been used mainly in thromboprophylaxis during pregnancy and rarely in the treatment of acute DVT in pregnant women. In a prospective observational study, we compared the effectiveness and safety of the LMW heparin, dalteparin, with UF heparin in the initial treatment (first week) of DVT during pregnancy. After confirmation of DVT by ultrasonography, 10 women were treated with UF heparin (25,430 IU/day, mean) and 21 women with dalteparin (16,000 IU/day, mean) for 7 days and, thereafter, all women were given treatment doses of LMW heparin for another 2 weeks. The dose was then gradually decreased and kept at a high prophylactic dose until delivery. One patient in the dalteparin group had recurrence of DVT 2 weeks after starting the treatment. No differences were observed between the groups in symptoms or bleeding complications during pregnancy and delivery. Our results indicate that LMW heparin is as effective and safe as UF heparin for the first week of treatment, but LMW heparin has the advantage of being easily administered and few laboratory controls are required.","The only study of unfractionated heparin for the treatment of VTE in pregnancy used aPTT levels extrapolated from nonpregnant patients, with a mean heparin dose of 25,430 IU/d, similar to mean doses for nonpregnant patients."
"When is neuroimaging warranted for headache
Our aims were to investigate the frequency of intracranial lesions detected by cranial computed tomography (CT-scan) amongst adult patients who had clinical warning criteria (CWC) for secondary neurological headaches and to determine the importance of CWC in predicting a possible lesion on CT-scan. Seventy consecutive patients with headache exhibiting CWC were included in this prospective study. The CWC included: (i) increase in the intensity and frequency of headache; (ii) abrupt onset of headache; (iii) persistence of headache despite analgesics; (iv) alteration of the characteristics of headache; and (v) presence of focal neurological symptoms or findings. The mean age of the patients was 46.5 years; the female-to-male ratio was 1.5. Of the patients, 35.7% had a neurological cause identified by CT-scan, and 64.3% had normal CT-scan. In the patients without lesion, of headaches, 64.4% were primary, and 35.6% were from undefined headache group. Although, of the above criteria, only the 5th was different markedly in the patients with lesion than the patients without lesion, in evaluation by CT-scan the secondary neurological headaches in adults, all CWC should look for absolutely in their history and physical examination.","A validating cohort study looked at 5 clinical warning criteria for patients seen in an emergency department for headache; 70 adults with acute headache as the chief complaint were included. Allpatients received computed tomography (CT) scanning as part of their evaluation. Abrupt onset and focal neurologic findings most strongly predicted intracranial lesions. Overall, 36% of the patients (25/70) had significant pathology."
"When is neuroimaging warranted for headache
Clinicians in the Ambulatory Sentinel Practice Network (ASPN) order computed tomography (CT) scans for approximately 3% of patients with headache. This study was undertaken to provide information about the reasons for ordering CT scans and the results obtained. Weekly return cards were used to collect data on every patient for whom a CT scan was ordered to investigate a headache during a 19-month period. Copies of CT reports were reviewed, and a chart audit was performed to collect further clinical information whenever an intracranial tumor, subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), or subdural hematoma (SDH) was reported. Clinicians in 58 practices ordered 349 CT scans. Only 52 patients (15%) had abnormalities noted on neurological examination. Most CT scans were ordered because the clinician believed that a tumor (49%) or an SAH (9%) might be present. Fifty-nine (17%) were ordered because of patient expectation or medicolegal concerns. Of the 293 reports reviewed, 14 indicated that a tumor, an SAH, or an SDH was present. Two of the 14 (14%) were false positives. Forty-four (15%) of the reports noted incidental findings of questionable significance. Because there are no clear guidelines for the use of CT for the investigation of headache, physicians must exercise good clinical judgment in their attempts to identify treatable disease in a cost-effective manner. ASPN clinicians made selective use of CT scans based on a combination of factors that included physician and patient concerns. CT was an imperfect tool in this setting. Most of the positive results represented false positives or incidental findings that could have led to adverse effects and additional costs.","When neuroimaging is performed, about 4% of CT scans find a significant and treatable lesion (in one sample of 293 CT scans, there were 12 true-positive scans and 2 false-positive scans)."
"What are the best therapies for acute migraine in pregnancy
To review the literature for treatment of migraine headaches with sumatriptan during pregnancy. Studies and reports were located in International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970-September 2003) and MEDLINE (1966-week 3 September 2003). Research has been performed to evaluate the risk of teratogenesis after sumatriptan exposure in pregnant patients. Data have been collected in areas including placental transmission of sumatriptan, prospective pregnancy registries, open-labeled and controlled prospective studies, and a retrospective prescription-linked study. As of August 6, 2004, no randomized controlled trials have been conducted with exposure to sumatriptan during pregnancy. Teratogenesis occurs in approximately 150 000 births per year which represents an incidence of 3-5%. Available literature to date indicates that exposure to sumatriptan during pregnancy has no additional risk of birth defects compared with the incidence in the general population.",Six studies have evaluated sumatriptan use in pregnancy. All were designed to evaluate teratogenicity and harm. None evaluated treatment efficacy in pregnancy.
"Which late-stage Alzheimer's patients should be referred for hospice care
The goal of the present study was to assess the validity of the Medicare hospice eligibility guidelines for dementia patients, as well as identify predictors that could more accurately identify prognosis in dementia patients referred to hospice. A retrospective chart review was conducted, including initial assessment and longitudinal follow-up of patients until the time of death. In addition, a second validation cohort was also followed. Participants consisted of 245 patients admitted to a large community-based hospice with a diagnosis of dementia, including a validation sample of 80 patients. The Kaplan-Meier estimation of survival and a Cox regression analysis (p > 0. 05) revealed no significant relationship between the Medicare guidelines or any component of the guidelines and survival at six months for the initial and validation samples. Significant multivariate predictors of shorter survival in both the initial and validation sample include greater age (p = 0. 02) and anorexia (p < 0. 001), as well as a combination of anorexia and greater functional impairment (p = 0.005). Overall, the results indicated that the Medicare guidelines were not valid predictors of survival in hospice patients with dementia and should be altered to include empirically valid predictors. Advanced age, as well as impaired nutritional and functional status, was associated with shortened survival in these patients. The predictor variables identified are an initial step toward providing improved prognoses for advanced dementia patients, their families, and practitioners. Broader issues in improving access to hospice care for dementia patients are discussed.",Medicare adapted the National Hospice Organization guidelines to determine patients' eligibility for hospice care.
"Which late-stage Alzheimer's patients should be referred for hospice care
Because survival time varies greatly in dementia, it is difficult for dementia patients to meet a key criterion for the Medicare Hospice Benefit, a six-month survival time. In a previous study, the authors examined guidelines for admitting dementia patients to hospice; the National Hospice Organization (NHO) guidelines were found to work well in identifying appropriate candidates for hospice among dementia patients. This was especially true for those patients whose deficits had progressed in an ordinal fashion consistent with Functional Assessment Staging (FAST) and who had reached stage 7C. The purpose of this study was to examine the utility of the NHO guidelines in identifying dementia patients who are appropriate for hospice; the limitations of these guidelines regarding non-ordinal patients; and the importance of the actual care plans used--as opposed to our previous study, which only examined initial treatment plans. Forty-five dementia patients enrolled in Hospice of the Great Lakes in Illinois were studied longitudinally over two years; this included a follow-up period of at least six months for all patients. Measures included: survival time; FAST; a medical complications checklist, which consisted of common complications of end-stage dementia; and co-morbid medical conditions and aggressive care, which consisted of feeding tubes, antibiotics, and Foley catheters used during the course of the study. Patients who had reached Stage 7C at intake had a mean survival time of 4.1 months; and the majority (71 percent) died within six months. Non-ordinal patients lived significantly longer at a mean of 10.9 months (p < .01), and and the minority (30 percent) died within six months. Foley catheters decreased survival time; and the use of antibiotics did not make a difference. This study echoed our previous findings regarding the usefulness of NHO guidelines in identifying dementia patients with a survival time of six months or less, specifically those at stage 7C or greater. The findings also suggest that the nature of the palliative care plan influences survival time.","Use of antibiotics did not make a statistically significant difference in survival, and use of Foley catheters was associated with shorter survival times (3.6 months vs 9 months; P<.03.)."
"What medications are safe and effective for heartburn during pregnancy
To determine whether ranitidine (Zantac) taken once or twice daily is effective for relieving symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux among pregnant women who had failed conservative measures. Volunteers with heartburn despite antacids were sought among our obstetrics clinic population for this double-blind, placebo-controlled, triple crossover trial. After a baseline week, 20 patients were randomized to receive the three following weekly regimens: ranitidine 150 mg twice daily, placebo in the morning and ranitidine 150 mg in the evening, or placebo twice daily. Daily scores on symptom diaries, global assessments, and number of antacids taken were compared among the 18 patients completing the study. The twice-daily dosage of ranitidine was the only regimen found to reduce heartburn symptoms when compared with the baseline (P < .001) or a placebo (P < .01). Compared with ranitidine taken once daily, the twice-daily dosing prompted less need for antacid tablets compared with the placebo (P < .05 versus P > .05) and to the baseline (P < .001 versus P < .05). The average reduction of heartburn severity using twice-daily ranitidine was 55.6% when compared with baseline (95% confidence interval [CI] 34.8%, 76.5%) was 44.2% when compared with placebo (95% CI 15.4%, 72.9%). This study indicates the efficacy of ranitidine 150 mg taken twice daily, rather than once daily, for relief of gastroesophageal reflux symptoms during pregnancy.",A 4-week double-blind randomized control trial found that ranitidine 150 mg twice daily reduced patient symptoms by 44% over placebo (P <.05). This study was limited by its short duration (<1 month) and small sample size (N=30).
"What are the best prophylactic drugs for migraine
To evaluate the efficacy and safety of divalproex sodium (DVPX) when used as prophylactic monotherapy in patients with migraine. Multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group. Patients were previously untreated or had failed no more than two adequate trials of prophylactic therapy. During the 4-week (single-blind) baseline, patients received placebo and completed a headache diary. Patients with two or more migraine attacks during the baseline were randomized to receive a DVPX daily dose of 500, 1000, or 1500 mg, or to placebo. The experimental phase (EP) lasted 12 weeks, the first 4 weeks for dose escalation to randomized dose, and the remaining 8 weeks for maintenance at that dose. The primary efficacy variable was 4-week migraine attack frequency during the EP. One-hundred-and-seventy-six patients (44 placebo, 132 DVPX) were randomized; 171 provided efficacy data and 137 completed the study. During the EP, after adjustment for differences in baseline migraine attack frequencies, mean reductions in the DVPX groups were 1.7 (500 mg), 2.0 (1000 mg) and 1.7 (1500 mg) migraine attacks per 4 weeks compared to a mean reduction of 0.5 migraine attacks in the placebo group (p < or = 0.05 vs placebo). Forty-four to 45% of DVPX-treated patients compared to 21% of patients in the placebo group achieved > or = 50% reduction in their migraine attack frequencies (p < or = 0.05 vs placebo). The recommended initial dose of DVPX in migraine prophylaxis is 500 mg per day, although some patients may benefit from higher doses. Adverse events were similar in the DVPX and placebo treatment groups except for nausea, dizziness and tremor in which incidence rates were significantly higher in the DVPX 1500 mg group (nausea was also higher in 500 mg group) than in the placebo group. Divalproex sodium is an effective prophylactic treatment in migraine and is generally well tolerated.","No evidence from controlled trials supports the use of fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, phenelzine, venlafaxine, mirtazapine, trazodone, or bupropion. Initial studies of delayed-release divalproex at doses ranging from 500 to 1500 mg daily found that 44% of divalproex-treated patients reported a 50% reduction in migraine frequency, compared with 21% in the placebo group (number needed to treat [NNT]=4)."
"What are the best prophylactic drugs for migraine
Migraine is a debilitating condition characterized by a cycle of painful headaches and headache-related symptoms interspersed with periods of worry, distress, and apprehension. The negative impact of migraine on patient functioning, workplace productivity, and other daily activities has been demonstrated through the use of a variety of clinician- and patient-reported assessment tools, including the Migraine-Specific Questionnaire and the Migraine Disability Assessment questionnaire. In addition to considering the frequency and severity of migraine, clinicians need to encourage more open dialogue with their patients about the impact of this disorder on daily activities and productivity. Only then can the most appropriate course of treatment be determined. Appropriately prescribed acute and preventive therapies should break the cycle of migraine and improve the daily activities of patients with this chronic condition. Divalproex sodium and topiramate are neuromodulators that are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the prophylaxis (prevention) of migraine headache in adults. Non-FDA-approved neuromodulators sometimes used in the management of migraine headache include gabapentin, lamotrigine, levetiracetam, and zonisamide. All medications need to be titrated, and treatment-related adverse events need to be managed appropriately. Preventive medications should be taken for at least 2-3 months to ascertain their therapeutic effect.","Topiramate has significantly reduced the mean frequency of episodic migraine at doses of 100 to 200 mg daily and also improved secondary end points, including number of migraine days per month, use of acute medication, and daily activity."
"When should you consider implanted nerve stimulators for lower back pain
Persistent or recurrent radicular pain after lumbosacral spine surgery is often associated with nerve root compression and is treated by repeated operation or, as a last resort, by spinal cord stimulation (SCS). We conducted a prospective, randomized, controlled trial to test our hypothesis that SCS is more likely than reoperation to result in a successful outcome by standard measures of pain relief and treatment outcome, including subsequent use of health care resources. For an average of 3 years postoperatively, disinterested third-party interviewers followed 50 patients selected for reoperation by standard criteria and randomized to SCS or reoperation. If the results of the randomized treatment were unsatisfactory, patients could cross over to the alternative. Success was based on self-reported pain relief and patient satisfaction. Crossover to the alternative procedure was an outcome measure. Use of analgesics, activities of daily living, and work status were self-reported. Among 45 patients (90%) available for follow-up, SCS was more successful than reoperation (9 of 19 patients versus 3 of 26 patients, P <0.01). Patients initially randomized to SCS were significantly less likely to cross over than were those randomized to reoperation (5 of 24 patients versus 14 of 26 patients, P=0.02). Patients randomized to reoperation required increased opiate analgesics significantly more often than those randomized to SCS (P <0.025). Other measures of activities of daily living and work status did not differ significantly. SCS is more effective than reoperation as a treatment for persistent radicular pain after lumbosacral spine surgery, and in the great majority of patients, it obviates the need for reoperation.","A 2005 prospective RCT enrolled 50 patients with failed back surgery syndrome who were considering reoperation. Twenty-four were randomized to SCS and 26 to reoperation. Success was defined as >50% pain relief measured by a validated visual analog pain scale. The average length of follow-up was 3 years. An intention-to-treat analysis demonstrated that 9 of 24 (38%) SCS insertions were successful, compared with 3 of 26 (12%) reoperations (P=.04; number needed to treat=3.8)."
"What's the best way to motivate patients to exercise
Without detailed evidence of their effectiveness, pedometers have recently become popular as a tool for motivating physical activity. To evaluate the association of pedometer use with physical activity and health outcomes among outpatient adults. English-language articles from MEDLINE, EMBASE, Sport Discus, PsychINFO, Cochrane Library, Thompson Scientific (formerly known as Thompson ISI), and ERIC (1966-2007); bibliographies of retrieved articles; and conference proceedings. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they reported an assessment of pedometer use among adult outpatients, reported a change in steps per day, and included more than 5 participants. DATA EXTRACTION AND DATA SYNTHESIS: Two investigators independently abstracted data about the intervention; participants; number of steps per day; and presence or absence of obesity, diabetes, hypertension, or hyperlipidemia. Data were pooled using random-effects calculations, and meta-regression was performed. Our searches identified 2246 citations; 26 studies with a total of 2767 participants met inclusion criteria (8 randomized controlled trials [RCTs] and 18 observational studies). The participants' mean (SD) age was 49 (9) years and 85% were women. The mean intervention duration was 18 weeks. In the RCTs, pedometer users significantly increased their physical activity by 2491 steps per day more than control participants (95% confidence interval [CI], 1098-3885 steps per day, P < .001). Among the observational studies, pedometer users significantly increased their physical activity by 2183 steps per day over baseline (95% CI, 1571-2796 steps per day, P < .0001). Overall, pedometer users increased their physical activity by 26.9% over baseline. An important predictor of increased physical activity was having a step goal such as 10,000 steps per day (P = .001). When data from all studies were combined, pedometer users significantly decreased their body mass index by 0.38 (95% CI, 0.05-0.72; P = .03). This decrease was associated with older age (P = .001) and having a step goal (P = .04). Intervention participants significantly decreased their systolic blood pressure by 3.8 mm Hg (95% CI, 1.7-5.9 mm Hg, P < .001). This decrease was associated with greater baseline systolic blood pressure (P = .009) and change in steps per day (P = .08). The results suggest that the use of a pedometer is associated with significant increases in physical activity and significant decreases in body mass index and blood pressure. Whether these changes are durable over the long term is undetermined.","A systematic review using meta-regression to calculate summary effects evaluated the use of pedometers by study participants for an average of 18 weeks. Pedometer users increased their physical activity significantly, by 2491 steps per day compared with controls (95% confidence interval [CI], 1098-3885 steps per day)."

The Guide to Community Preventive Service's methods for systematic reviews were used to evaluate the effectiveness of various approaches to increasing physical activity: informational, behavioral and social, and environmental and policy approaches. Changes in physical activity behavior and aerobic capacity were used to assess effectiveness. Two informational interventions (""point-of-decision"" prompts to encourage stair use and community-wide campaigns) were effective, as were three behavioral and social interventions (school-based physical education, social support in community settings, and individually-adapted health behavior change) and one environmental and policy intervention (creation of or enhanced access to places for physical activity combined with informational outreach activities). Additional information about applicability, other effects, and barriers to implementation are provided for these interventions. Evidence is insufficient to assess a number of interventions: classroom-based health education focused on information provision, and family-based social support (because of inconsistent findings); mass media campaigns and college-based health education and physical education (because of an insufficient number of studies); and classroom-based health education focused on reducing television viewing and video game playing (because of insufficient evidence of an increase in physical activity). These recommendations should serve the needs of researchers, planners, and other public health decision makers.","The US Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) conducted a systematic review of 94 qualifying trials and assigned interventions to 1 of 3 approaches: ""information based,"" ""behavioral and social,"" and ""facilities and activities."" Behavioral and social interventions have the best data support. Within this category, strong evidence backed school-based physical education and accountability partners or exercise support groups. School-based physical education resulted in a median net increase in physical activity time of 50.3% (range 6.0%-125.3%); accountability partners or support groups produced a mean net increase of 44.2% (interquartile range 19.9%-45.6%)."

To review the published literature on the effectiveness of interventions to promote physical activity in children and adolescents. Systematic review. Literature search using PubMed, SCOPUS, Psychlit, Ovid Medline, Sportdiscus, and Embase up to December 2006. Two independent reviewers assessed studies against the following inclusion criteria: controlled trial, comparison of intervention to promote physical activity with no intervention control condition, participants younger than 18 years, and reported statistical analyses of a physical activity outcome measure. Levels of evidence, accounting for methodological quality, were assessed for three types of intervention, five settings, and three target populations. The literature search identified 57 studies: 33 aimed at children and 24 at adolescents. Twenty four studies were of high methodological quality, including 13 studies in children. Interventions that were found to be effective achieved increases ranging from an additional 2.6 minutes of physical education related physical activity to 283 minutes per week of overall physical activity. Among children, limited evidence for an effect was found for interventions targeting children from low socioeconomic populations, and environmental interventions. Strong evidence was found that school based interventions with involvement of the family or community and multicomponent interventions can increase physical activity in adolescents. Some evidence was found for potentially effective strategies to increase children's levels of physical activity. For adolescents, multicomponent interventions and interventions that included both school and family or community involvement have the potential to make important differences to levels of physical activity and should be promoted. A lack of high quality evaluations hampers conclusions concerning effectiveness, especially among children.",A British systematic review of 24 high-quality controlled trials involving adolescents and children reported significant improvements with interventions that were school-based and either community- or family-based. Multidimensional outcomes included a 42% increase in participation in regular physical activity and an increase of 83 minutes weekly in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity.
"Should you test or treat partners of patients with gonorrhea, chlamydia, or trichomoniasis
Many sex partners of persons with gonorrhea or chlamydial infections are not treated, which leads to frequent reinfections and further transmission. We randomly assigned women and heterosexual men with gonorrhea or chlamydial infection to have their partners receive expedited treatment or standard referral. Patients in the expedited-treatment group were offered medication to give to their sex partners, or if they preferred, study staff members contacted partners and provided them with medication without a clinical examination. Patients assigned to standard partner referral were advised to refer their partners for treatment and were offered assistance notifying partners. The primary outcome was persistent or recurrent gonorrhea or chlamydial infection in patients 3 to 19 weeks after treatment. Persistent or recurrent gonorrhea or chlamydial infection occurred in 121 of 931 patients (13 percent) assigned to standard partner referral and 92 of 929 (10 percent) assigned to expedited treatment of sexual partners (relative risk, 0.76; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.59 to 0.98). Expedited treatment was more effective than standard referral of partners in reducing persistent or recurrent infection among patients with gonorrhea (3 percent vs. 11 percent, P=0.01) than in those with chlamydial infection (11 percent vs. 13 percent, P=0.17) (P=0.05 for the comparison of treatment effects) and remained independently associated with a reduced risk of persistent or recurrent infection after adjustment for other predictors of infection at follow-up (relative risk, 0.75; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.57 to 0.97). Patients assigned to expedited treatment of sexual partners were significantly more likely than those assigned to standard referral of partners to report that all of their partners were treated and significantly less likely to report having sex with an untreated partner. Expedited treatment of sex partners reduces the rates of persistent or recurrent gonorrhea or chlamydial infection.",One RCT compared expedited partner therapy with patient referral for patients with trichomoniasis. The study did not show a statistically significant difference in recurrent or persistent infection.
"What is the most effective treatment for ADHD in children
The treatment of children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and Tourette syndrome (TS) has been problematic because methylphenidate (MPH)--the most commonly used drug to treat ADHD--has been reported to worsen tics and because clonidine (CLON)--the most commonly prescribed alternative--has unproven efficacy. The authors conducted a multicenter, randomized, double-blind clinical trial in which 136 children with ADHD and a chronic tic disorder were randomly administered CLON alone, MPH alone, combined CLON + MPH, or placebo (2 x 2 factorial design). Each subject participated for 16 weeks (weeks 1-4 CLON/placebo dose titration, weeks 5-8 added MPH/placebo dose titration, weeks 9-16 maintenance therapy). Thirty-seven children were administered MPH alone, 34 were administered CLON alone, 33 were administered CLON + MPH, and 32 were administered placebo. For our primary outcome measure of ADHD (Conners Abbreviated Symptom Questionnaire--Teacher), significant improvement occurred for subjects assigned to CLON (p < 0.002) and those assigned to MPH (p < 0.003). Compared with placebo, the greatest benefit occurred with combined CLON + MPH (p < 0.0001). CLON appeared to be most helpful for impulsivity and hyperactivity; MPH appeared to be most helpful for inattention. The proportion of individual subjects reporting a worsening of tics as an adverse effect was no higher in those treated with MPH (20%) than those being administered CLON alone (26%) or placebo (22%). Compared with placebo, measured tic severity lessened in all active treatment groups in the following order: CLON + MPH, CLON alone, MPH alone. Sedation was common with CLON treatment (28% reported moderate or severe sedation), but otherwise the drugs were tolerated well, including absence of any evident cardiac toxicity. Methylphenidate and clonidine (particularly in combination) are effective for ADHD in children with comorbid tics. Prior recommendations to avoid methylphenidate in these children because of concerns of worsening tics are unsupported by this trial.","One RCT of 136 children with ADHD and tics showed improvement of both problems with the use of methylphenidate and clonidine, particularly in combination."
"What are effective treatments for oppositional and defiant behaviors in preadolescents
To determine by meta-analysis the effect size for stimulants on overt and covert aggression-related behaviors in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), separately from stimulant effects on the core symptoms of ADHD. A review of the literature from 1970 to 2001 revealed 28 studies meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria for meta-analysis. These studies yielded 28 independent effects of overt aggression and 7 independent effects of covert aggression. The overall weighted mean effect size was 0.84 for overt and 0.69 for covert aggression related behaviors in ADHD. Comorbid conduct disorder is associated with diminishing stimulant effect size for overt aggression. Stimulant effects for aggression-related behaviors in ADHD have effect sizes similar to those for the core symptoms of ADHD.","In treating oppositional behaviors among children with ADHD and comorbid oppositional defiant disorder or conduct disorder, a meta-analysis identified 28 studies of children age 7 to 15 years that addressed oppositional/aggression-related behaviors within the context of ADHD. The analysis found that stimulants are efficacious. The overall weighted effect size a measure of improvement representing the average effects across all reporters was 0.89. This indicates that raters saw a change in oppositional behaviors-noncompliance, irritability, and temper tantrums-that corresponded to a drop in scores of approximately 1 standard deviation."
"What's the best treatment for pyogenic granuloma
Pyogenic granulomas have been treated by cryosurgery, curettage, electrodesiccation, chemical cauterization, and laser surgery. The therapeutic effects of these conservative treatments are limited, however. In this study, the efficacy of a sclerosing agent (monoethanolamine oleate) was evaluated for the treatment of pyogenic granuloma. Pyogenic granuloma was treated by local injection of the monoethanolamine oleate solution in nine patients who were from 1 to 57 years of age (median 18 years). The treatment effect was determined by physical examination. All lesions were removed completely with no recurrence, and scars were inconspicuous in all cases. Complications occurred in only one patient who complained of pain due to an avoidable injection of excess solution. Sclerotherapy with monoethanolamine oleate is effective in the treatment of pyogenic granuloma and offers an alternative to conventional methods in cases for which conservative treatment is preferable.",A case series reported results in 9 patients (median age 18 years; range 1-57 years) with pyogenic granuloma treated with a single injection of the sclerosing agent monoethanolamine oleate. All lesions disappeared without recurrence; the authors described remaining scars as inconspicuous. One patient reported residual pain lasting 4 weeks after injection of the sclerosing agent into a 1.5 cm x 1.0 cm pyogenic granuloma that hadn't responded to previous cryotherapy.
"Which treatments work best for hemorrhoids
This review compares the two most popular treatments for haemorrhoids, namely rubber band ligation (RBL) and excisional haemorrhoidectomy. Randomized trials were identified from the major electronic databases. Symptom control, retreatment, postoperative pain, complications, time off work and patient satisfaction were assessed. Relative risk (RR) and weighted mean difference with 95 per cent confidence interval (c.i.) were estimated using a random-effects model for dichotomous and continuous outcomes respectively. Three trials met the inclusion criteria and all were of poor methodological quality. Complete remission of haemorrhoidal symptoms was better after haemorrhoidectomy (RR 1.68 (95 per cent c.i 1.00 to 2.83)). There was significant heterogeneity between the studies (I(2) = 90.5 per cent; P < 0.001). Fewer patients required retreatment after haemorrhoidectomy (RR 0.20 (95 per cent c.i 0.09 to 0.40)), but anal stenosis, postoperative haemorrhage and incontinence to flatus were more common with this operation. Haemorrhoidectomy produced better long-term symptom control in patients with grade III haemorrhoids, but was associated with more postoperative complications than RBL.",A systematic review of 3 poor-quality trials comparing rubber band ligation with excisional hemorrhoidectomy in patients with grade III hemorrhoids found that excisional hemorrhoidectomy produced better long-term symptom control but more immediate postoperative complications of anal stenosis and hemorrhage.
"Which treatments work best for hemorrhoids
Symptomatic hemorrhoids are a common medical condition, which increase in prevalence in women during pregnancy and postpartum. Although the evidence appears to be inconclusive, narrative reviews and clinical practice guidelines recommend the use of laxatives (and fiber) for the treatment of hemorrhoids and relief of symptoms. This is due to their safety and low cost. To evaluate the impact of laxatives on a wide range of symptoms in people with symptomatic hemorrhoids. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2005), MEDLINE (1966 to 2005), EMBASE (1980 to 2005), CINAHL (1982 to 2005), BIOSIS, and AMED (Allied and Alternative Medicine Database), for eligible trials (including conference proceedings). We sought missing and additional information from authors, industry, and experts in the field. We selected all published and unpublished randomised controlled trials that compared any type of laxative to placebo or no therapy in any patient population. Two authors independently screened studies for inclusion and retrieved all potentially relevant studies. Data were extracted from studies that met our selection criteria on study population, intervention used, pre-specified outcomes, and methodology. We extracted methodological information for the assessment of internal validity: existence and method of generation of the randomization schedule, and method of allocation concealment; blinding of caregivers and outcomes assessors; numbers of and reasons for participants lost to follow up; and use of validated outcome measures. Seven randomised trials enrolling a total of 378 participants to fiber or a non-fiber control were identified. Meta-analyses using random-effects models showed that laxatives in the form of fiber had a beneficial effect in the treatment of symptomatic hemorrhoids. The risk of not improving hemorrhoids and having persisting symptoms decreased by 53% in the fiber group (risk reduction (RR) 0.47, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.68). These results are compatible with large treatment effects regarding prolapse, pain, itching, although the pooled analyses showed a tendency toward no-effect for these parametres. The effect on bleeding showed a significant difference in favour of the fiber (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.89). Studies including data on multiple follow ups (usually after six weeks and three months) showed consistent results over time. However, we have to stress two possible limitations of this review: the risk of publication bias, and only moderate study quality. The use of fiber shows a consistent beneficial effect for relieving overall symptoms and bleeding in the treatment of symptomatic hemorrhoids.","A Cochrane systematic review of 7 RCTs enrolling a total of 378 patients with grade I to III hemorrhoids evaluated the effect of fiber supplements on pain, itching, and bleeding. Persistent hemorrhoid symptoms decreased by 53% in the group receiving fiber."
"How effective are dietary interventions in lowering lipids in adults with dyslipidemia
Plasma lipid and lipoprotein responses have been variable in dietary intervention studies. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of the National Cholesterol Education Program's Step I and Step II dietary interventions on major cardiovascular disease risk factors using meta-analysis. MEDLINE was used to select 37 dietary intervention studies in free-living subjects published from 1981 to 1997. Step I and Step II dietary interventions significantly decreased plasma lipids and lipoproteins. Plasma total cholesterol (TC), LDL cholesterol, triacylglycerol, and TC:HDL cholesterol decreased by 0.63 mmol/L (10%), 0.49 mmol/L (12%), 0.17 mmol/L (8%), and 0.50 (10%), respectively, in Step I intervention studies, and by 0.81 mmol/L (13%), 0.65 mmol/L (16%), 0.19 mmol/L (8%), and 0.34 (7%), respectively, in Step II intervention studies (P < 0.01 for all). HDL cholesterol decreased by 7% (P = 0.05) in response to Step II but not to Step I dietary interventions. Positive correlations between changes in dietary total and saturated fatty acids and changes in TC and LDL and HDL cholesterol were observed (r = 0.59, 0.61, and 0.46, respectively; P < 0.001). Multiple regression analyses showed that for every 1% decrease in energy consumed as dietary saturated fatty acid, TC decreased by 0.056 mmol/L and LDL cholesterol by 0.05 mmol/L. Moreover, for every 1-kg decrease in body weight, triacylglycerol decreased by 0.011 mmol/L and HDL cholesterol increased by 0.011 mmol/L. Exercise resulted in greater decreases in TC, LDL cholesterol, and triacylglycerol and prevented the decrease in HDL cholesterol associated with low-fat diets. Step I and Step II dietary interventions have multiple beneficial effects on important cardiovascular disease risk factors.","A meta-analysis of 37 mostly good-quality controlled trials evaluated the former National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Step I and Step II diets in 11,586 participants. The Step I diet restricted in-take of total fat (≤30% of total calories), saturated fat (≤10% of total calories), and cholesterol (≤300 mg/d). Step II goals were lower for saturated fat (<7%) and cholesterol (<200 mg/d). Mean baseline lipid values (mg/dL) were total cholesterol, 233.57; LDL, 155.10; HDL, 47.95; and triglycerides, 147.91. Both of these low-fat diets significantly reduced total cholesterol, LDL, and triglycerides. The Step II diet also reduced HDL."
"How effective are dietary interventions in lowering lipids in adults with dyslipidemia
3-Hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors reduce serum cholesterol and are increasingly advocated in primary prevention to achieve reductions in LDL cholesterol. Newer dietary approaches combining cholesterol-lowering foods may offer another option, but these approaches have not been compared directly with statins in the same persons. The objective was to compare, in the same subjects, the cholesterol-lowering potential of a dietary portfolio with that of a statin. Thirty-four hyperlipidemic participants underwent all three 1-mo treatments in random order as outpatients: a very-low-saturated-fat diet (control diet), the same diet plus 20 mg lovastatin (statin diet), and a diet high in plant sterols (1.0 g/1000 kcal), soy-protein foods (including soy milks and soy burgers, 21.4 g/1000 kcal), almonds (14 g/1000 kcal), and viscous fibers from oats, barley, psyllium, and the vegetables okra and eggplant (10 g/1000 kcal) (portfolio diets). Fasting blood samples were obtained at 0, 2, and 4 wk. LDL-cholesterol concentrations decreased by 8.5+/-1.9%, 33.3+/-1.9%, and 29.6+/-1.3% after 4 wk of the control, statin, and portfolio diets, respectively. Although the absolute difference between the statin and the portfolio treatments was significant at 4 wk (P=0.013), 9 participants (26%) achieved their lowest LDL-cholesterol concentrations with the portfolio diet. Moreover, the statin (n=27) and the portfolio (n=24) diets did not differ significantly (P=0.288) in their ability to reduce LDL cholesterol below the 3.4-mmol/L primary prevention cutoff. Dietary combinations may not differ in potency from first-generation statins in achieving current lipid goals for primary prevention. They may, therefore, bridge the treatment gap between current therapeutic diets and newer statins.","A randomized crossover study with 34 participants found that a ""portfolio diet"", which combines the fat intake of the NCEP Step II diet with cholesterol-lowering ""functional foods"" (including plant sterols, nuts, soluble fibers, and soy protein), markedly reduced total cholesterol and LDL. Mean baseline lipid values (mg/dL) were: total cholesterol, 261.41; LDL, 174.40; HDL, 47.56; triglycerides, 199.28."
"What is the most effective treatment for acute low back pain
Criteria-based review. Reviews based on trials published up to 1990 conclude that the efficacy of exercise therapy in patients with low back pain is questionable. To determine from recently published trials the efficacy of exercises in patients with acute, subacute, or chronic back pain. A Medline search for randomized trials concerning exercise therapy in patients with back pain published from 1991 until the first quarter of 1995 was conducted. All studies were given a method score (maximum, 100 points). Eleven randomized trials were included: four in acute back pain, one in subacute, and six in patients with chronic back pain. Three trials had method scores lower than 40 points. For acute back pain, two trials with high method scores (> 50 points) reported no efficacy of flexion or extension exercises; two trials of the McKenzie type of exercises reported positive results but had low method scores. For subacute pain, one trial (> 50 points) reported positive results of exercises with a graded activity program. For chronic back pain, three trials reported positive results with different types of exercises; two trials reported better results with intensive exercising compared with low grade exercising, but after 12 months, this effect had disappeared. In chronic pain, no relation between method score and conclusions could be found. In acute back pain, exercise therapy is ineffective, whereas in subacute back pain, exercises with a graded activity program, and in chronic back pain, intensive exercising, deserve attention. More research on McKenzie therapy, on exercises with a graded activity program, and on different types of exercising in patients with chronic back pain is necessary.",Performance of specific flexion or extension exercises was no more effective than analgesics.
"Is prostate-specific antigen PSA screening indicated for any subgroup of men
The issue of whether to screen men for prostate cancer is controversial. No randomized clinical trials have been completed to confirm the efficacy of screening for prostate cancer. We created a mathematical model of the clinical risks and benefits of screening for prostate cancer. A Markov decision-analytic model evaluated the outcomes of annually screening asymptomatic men for prostate cancer beginning at age 50 years. The screening and testing algorithm included the digital rectal examination, transrectal ultrasound, and prostate-specific antigen test. A sample of 10 male patients with no history of prostate disease were interviewed to assess their utilities (preferences) regarding the various adverse outcomes of prostate cancer treatment. The model indicated that no screening was preferred to screening when patients' utilities were considered (24.14 vs 23.47 quality-adjusted life years expected). The optimal decision was sensitive to the utilities of impotence and urethral stricture, the most common adverse outcomes for patients under the age of 65 years. When adverse outcomes of treatment were ignored, screening was favored (24.86 vs 24.22 years of life expectancy. When quality-of-life preferences of men are considered, the annual screening of asymptomatic patients for prostate cancer is not recommended.","A decision analysis, using quality-of-life measures, concluded that men would favor screening only if the prevalence of CaP were greater than any current estimate."
"Are tympanostomy tubes indicated for recurrent acute otitis media
Increasing concerns over drug-resistant bacteria mandate that alternative methods of treatment and prevention, including surgery, be considered to reduce antibiotic usage for acute otitis media (AOM). Meta-analysis of five randomized trials of tubes versus no surgery showed a mean absolute decrease in AOM incidence of 1.0 episode per child-year (95% CI, 0.4-1.6), with a relative decrease of 56%. Similarly, the prevalence of middle-ear effusion decreased by 115 days per child-year (95% CI, 11-220). Within several weeks of tube placement 79% of children had improved quality of life, 17% had trivial change, and 4% were worse. Systematic review of 134 articles revealed transient post-operative otorrhea in 16% of patients with tubes, and later in 26%; recurrent otorrhea occurred in 7.4% of patients and chronic otorrhea in 3.8% Adenoidectomy reduced AOM incidence by 0.32 episodes per child-year (95% CI, 0.03-0.61) for a 3-year period in one study (26% relative decrease), but the effect was only significant for children with prior tubes. Surgical therapy of otitis media offers significant benefits and is an effective prevention strategy in selected children.","A meta-analysis reporting sequelae of tympanostomy tubes found an absolute complication rate of 26% for transient otorrhea and 4% for chronic otorrhea. Within several weeks of tube placement, 79% of children had improved quality of life, 17% had trivial change, and 4% were worse."
"Are any alternative therapies effective in treating asthma
Acupuncture has traditionally been used to treat asthma in China and is used increasingly for this purpose internationally. The objective of this review was to assess the effects of acupuncture for the treatment of asthma or asthma-like symptoms. We searched the Cochrane Airways Group trials register (searched August 2003), the Cochrane Complementary Medicine Field trials register, the Alternative Medicine Database (August 2003) and reference lists of articles. We also contacted trialists and researchers in the field of complementary and alternative medical research. Randomised and possibly randomised trials using needle acupuncture or other forms of stimulation of acupuncture. Any form of control treatment was considered (no treatment in addition to conventional asthma treatment, sham or placebo interventions, active comparator interventions). Studies were included provided outcome was assessed at one week or more. At least two reviewers independently assessed trial quality. A reviewer experienced in acupuncture assessed the adequacy of the active and sham acupunctures used in the studies. Study authors were contacted for missing information. Eleven studies met the inclusion criteria with 324 participants. Trial reporting was poor and trial quality was deemed inadequate to generalise findings. There was variation in the type of active and sham acupunctures, the outcomes measured and time-points presented. The points used in the sham arm of some studies are used for the treatment of asthma according to traditional Chinese medicine. Two studies used individualised treatment strategies and one study used a combination strategy of formula acupuncture with the addition of individualised points. No statistically significant or clinically relevant effects were found for acupuncture compared to sham acupuncture. Data from two small studies were pooled for lung function (post-treatment FEV1): Standardised Mean Difference 0.12, 95% confidence interval -0.31 to 0.55). There is not enough evidence to make recommendations about the value of acupuncture in asthma treatment. Further research needs to consider the complexities and different types of acupuncture.","While a Cochrane review of 11 RCTs with variable trial quality and a total of 324 participants found that acupuncture had no significant effect on pulmonary function or global assessment of well-being, the review noted that some studies reported significant positive changes in daily symptoms, reductions in medication use, and improved quality of life. This suggests that some patients with mild to moderate asthma may benefit from acupuncture."
"Are any alternative therapies effective in treating asthma
Despite the growing number of studies of imagery and the use of complementary and alternative modalities as treatments for asthma, research on mental imagery in adults with asthma is practically, nonexistent. The purpose of this feasibility study was to lay groundwork for a larger follow-up clinical trial. To determine whether pulmonary function, asthma symptoms, quality of life, depression, anxiety, and power differ over time in adults with asthma who do and do not practice mental imagery (MI). (Power is the ability to make aware choices with the intention of freely involving oneself in creating desired change.) Randomized controlled study using univariate repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) and replacement through block design. Lenox Hill Hospital, an affiliate of New York University Medical School, New York, NY. Sixty-eight adults with symptomatic asthma, after 4 weeks of baseline data collection and analysis, met requirements for this randomized controlled study. Thirty-three completed pulmonary function as well as self-report tests at 4 time points over 17 weeks. The 16 experimental participants also completed the 4-session imagery protocol. Individual imagery instruction (week 1) and follow-up (weeks 4, 9, 15). Participants were given 7 imagery exercises to select from and practice 3 times a day for a total of 15 minutes. 1) Spirometry (FEV1); 2) medication use; 3) Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire; 4) Beck Depression Inventory; 5) Spielberger Anxiety Scales (A-State and A-Trait); 6) Barrett Power as Knowing Participation in Change Tool, Version II; 7) Epstein Balloon Test of Ability to Image. There was little evidence of statistical change in this feasibility study; yet, valuable lessons were learned. Paired t-tests indicated there was a significant difference in the total power scores in the imagery group, and in the expected direction (two-tailed, t-statistic = -2.3, P = 0.035) and the choices sub-scale (two-tailed, tstatistic = -2.93, P = 0.01) of the power instrument from weeks one to 16 of the study. Eight of 17 (47%) participants in the MI group reduced or discontinued their medications. Three of 16 (19%) participants in the control group reduced their medications; none discontinued. Chi-square indicated differences between groups (X2 = 4.66, P = 0.05). Persons who reduced or discontinued their medications showed neither an increase in pulmonary function prior to medication discontinuation, nor a fall in these parameters following discontinuation. Findings related to major outcome measures must be viewed with caution due to the small sample size resulting from attrition related to labor intensiveness and, therefore, low statistical power. However, the study did provide significant data to plan a larger scale study of the use of mental imagery with adult asthmatics. The study also demonstrated that imagery is inexpensive, safe and, with training, can be used as an adjunct therapy by patients themselves. Its efficacy needs additional exploration. Further research for adults with asthma who practice imagery is important, as current treatments are not entirely efficacious. Lessons learned in this study may facilitate improvement in research designs.","A pilot RCT with 33 adults found a nonsignificant reduction in medication use among the subjects practicing mental imagery, but no overall effect on lung function or quality-of-life measures."
"How should thyroid replacement be initiated
To compare relative bioavailability of Synthroid, Levoxine (Levoxine has been renamed Levoxyl), and 2 generic levothyroxine sodium preparations. Single-blind (primary investigators blinded), randomized, 4-way crossover trial. Ambulatory care. Twenty-two women with hypothyroidism who were clinically and chemically euthyroid and were receiving levothyroxine sodium, 0.1 or 0.15 mg. All patients received each of the 4 levothyroxine products for 6-week periods in the same dosage as their prestudy regimen with no washout period. The order of the drug sequences was randomly determined before study initiation. Area under the curve, time to peak serum concentrations, and peak serum concentrations of thyroxine, triiodothyronine, and free thyroxine index for all 4 products. All data analyses were completed prior to unblinding of the product codes. No significant differences between the 4 products were found in area under the curve or peak serum concentrations of total thyroxine, total triiodothyronine, or free thyroxine index. Although Synthroid produced a more rapid rise in total serum triiodothyronine concentration and a higher total peak serum triiodothyronine concentration than the other products, these differences were not statistically significant (P=.08). The Food and Drug Administration criterion for relative bioequivalence within 90% confidence intervals (0.8-1.25) was demonstrated (P<.05) for all pairs of products. Relative bioequivalence of 0.95 to 1.07 was demonstrated, tighter than the current bioequivalence criterion for oral formulations. The 4 generic and brand-name levothyroxine preparations studied are different but are bioequivalent by current Food and Drug Administration criteria and are interchangeable in the majority of patients receiving thyroxine replacement therapy. Further investigation is required to determine whether our results are equally applicable to all existing levothyroxine preparations.","In 1997, a bioequivalence study compared 2 generic brands to 2 name brands by having 22 women with hypothyroidism, who were euthyroid on replacement medication, take each preparation for 6 weeks. The area under the curve, peak serum concentration, and time to peak concentration for 3 indexes of thyroid function (thyroxine, triiodothyronine, and free T4 index) were not significantly different and met the FDA criterion for relative bioequivalence."
"How effective is gastric bypass for weight loss
Obesity is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Several observational epidemiological studies have indicated that weight gain and weight loss, even in the obese, is also related to an increased mortality. The Swedish Obese Subjects (SOS) study was initiated in 1987 as an attempt to elucidate this paradox. Two thousand matched patient pairs will be followed for 10 y each. One pair member is surgically treated, while the other receives conventional obesity treatment. By February 2000, 1879 patient pairs have been recruited. The two-y weight reduction was 28+/-15 kg among the operated patients and 0.5+/-8.9 kg among the obese controls. After eight years the weight loss was 20+/-16 kg in the surgical group, while the controls had gained 0.7+/-12 kg. Weight reductions achieved in the surgical group reduced the two-y incidence of diabetes 32 times as compared to the controls. After eight years there was still a 5-fold reduction in diabetes incidence. The two-y incidence of hypertension was similarly reduced 2.6 times in the surgical group. After eight years the incidence of hypertension was almost equal in the two study groups. Compared to weight stability, large intentional weight loss results in substantial reductions in the two-y incidence of several cardiovascular risk factors. After eight years there is still a reduced risk of developing diabetes in the surgical group, while the incidence of hypertension is equal in the two treatment groups. Whether intentional weight loss will reduce mortality is still too early to tell.","The Swedish Obesity Study, a large cohort study with matched controls. Surgery produced 23 to 28 kg more weight loss at 2 years. The study demonstrated 33% ± 10% weight loss for gastric bypass and 0% for medical therapy (not described) at 2 years."
"How effective is gastric bypass for weight loss
The beneficial effects of weight loss in the obese have been widely accepted. Still, there is a lack of controlled studies displaying large maintained weight losses over long periods (>4 years). We wanted to examine the results of long-standing intentional weight loss on the development of diabetes and hypertension in severely obese individuals over an 8-year period. In the ongoing prospective Swedish Obese Subjects (SOS) study, 346 patients awaiting gastric surgery were matched with 346 obese control subjects on 18 variables by a computerized matching program. The controls were drawn from a registry consisting of 1508 obese potential controls examined at primary health care centers in Sweden. Of the 692 selected patients (body mass index 41.2+/-4.7 kg/m(2) [mean+/-SD]), 483 (70%) were followed for 8 years. No significant weight changes occurred in the obese control group over 8 years. Gastric surgery resulted in a maximum weight loss of -31.1+/-13.6 kg after 1 year. After 8 years, the maintained weight loss was still 20.1+/-15.7 kg (16.3+/-12.3%). Whereas this weight reduction had a dramatic effect on the 8-year incidence of diabetes (odds ratio 0.16, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.36), it had no effect on the 8-year incidence of hypertension (odds ratio 1.01, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.67). A differentiated risk factor response was identified: a maintained weight reduction of 16% strongly counteracted the development of diabetes over 8 years but showed no long-term effect on the incidence of hypertension.","Among bariatric surgical techniques, patients undergoing gastric bypass lost more weight than those with gastroplasty (using staples to partition the stomach, either horizontally or vertically) (P=.057, not significant or gastric banding placing a constricting ring around the stomach) (P<.05) at 8 years."
"For knee pain, how predictive is physical examination for meniscal injury
The evaluation of acute knee pain often includes radiography of the knee. To synthesize the literature to determine the role of radiologic procedures in evaluating common causes of acute knee pain: fractures, meniscal or ligamentous injuries, osteoarthritis, and pseudogout. MEDLINE search from 1966 to October 2002. We included all published, peer-reviewed studies of decision rules for fractures. We included studies that used arthroscopy as the gold standard for measuring the accuracy of the physical examination and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for meniscal and ligamentous knee damage. We included all studies on the use of radiographs in pseudogout. We extracted all data in duplicate and abstracted physical examination and MRI results into 2 x 2 tables. Among the 5 decision rules for deciding when to use plain films in knee fractures, the Ottawa knee rules (injury due to trauma and age >55 years, tenderness at the head of the fibula or the patella, inability to bear weight for 4 steps, or inability to flex the knee to 90 degrees) have the strongest supporting evidence. When the history suggests a potential meniscal or ligamentous injury, the physical examination is moderately sensitive (meniscus, 87%; anterior cruciate ligament, 74%; and posterior cruciate ligament, 81%) and specific (meniscus, 92%; anterior cruciate ligament, 95%; and posterior cruciate ligament, 95%). The Lachman test is more sensitive and specific for ligamentous tears than is the drawer sign. For meniscal tears, joint line tenderness is sensitive (75%) but not specific (27%), while the McMurray test is specific (97%) but not sensitive (52%). Compared with the physical examination, MRI is more sensitive for ligamentous and meniscal damage but less specific. When the differential diagnosis for acute knee pain includes an exacerbation of osteoarthritis, clinical features (age >50 years, morning stiffness <30 minutes, crepitus, or bony enlargement) are 89% sensitive and 88% specific for underlying chronic arthritis. Adding plain films improves sensitivity slightly but not specificity. Plain films for pseudogout are not sensitive or specific, according to limited-quality studies. We recommend the Ottawa knee rules to decide when to obtain plain films for suspected knee fracture. A careful physical examination should be sufficient to decide whether to refer patients with potential meniscal and ligament injuries, and we prefer clinical criteria rather than plain films for evaluating osteoarthritis. We do not recommend using plain films to diagnose pseudogout.","A meta-analysis of 4 studies by Jackson compared the utility of the McMurray test and joint line tenderness. For detecting meniscal tears, the McMurray test had a clinically and statistically significant positive likelihood ratio of 17.33, corresponding to a posttest probability of nearly 61%. Negative likelihood ratios for the McMurray test and joint line tenderness (0.5 and 0.8) were not clinically significant, indicating that absence of the McMurray sign or joint line tenderness alone is of little benefit in ruling out meniscal injury."
"For knee pain, how predictive is physical examination for meniscal injury
This report describes ambulatory care visits made to physician offices within the United States. Statistics are presented on selected physician, patient, and visit characteristics of ambulatory care visits. The data presented in this report were collected from the 1996 National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS). The NAMCS is part of the ambulatory care component of the National Health Care Survey, which measures health care utilization across various types of providers. The NAMCS is a national probability sample survey of visits to office-based physicians in the United States. Sample data are weighted to produce annual estimates. During 1996, an estimated 734.5 million visits were made to physician offices in the United States, an overall rate of 2.8 visits per person. One quarter of the NAMCS visits were made to general and family physicians, which was significantly higher than the other 13 specialties. Persons 75 years and over had the highest rate of physician office visits, 6.3 visits per person. Females had a significantly higher rate of visits to physicians offices than males did overall, as did white persons compared with black persons. Of all visits made to these offices in 1996, 87 percent were covered by some form of insurance, and 8.7 percent were paid ""out-of-pocket."" There were an estimated 87.6 million injury-related visits during 1996, or 33.1 visits per 100 persons. Three-quarters of these visits were for unintentional injuries.","In a meta-analysis of 13 studies, no physical examination test-including assessment for joint effusion, McMurray test, joint line tenderness, or the Apley compression test-yielded clinically significant positive or negative likelihood ratios for a meniscal tear.

"For knee pain, how predictive is physical examination for meniscal injury
While most meniscal or ligamentous knee injuries heal with nonoperative treatments, a subset should be treated with arthroscopic or open surgery. To analyze the accuracy of the clinical examination for meniscal or ligamentous knee injuries. MEDLINE (1966-December 31, 2000) and HealthSTAR (1975-December 31, 2000) databases were searched for English-language articles describing the diagnostic accuracy of individual examination items for the knee and a combination of physical examination items (composite examination). Other data sources included reference lists from relevant articles. Studies selected for data extraction were those that compared the performance of the physical examination of the knee with a reference standard, such as arthroscopy, arthrotomy, or magnetic resonance imaging. Eighty-eight articles were identified, of which 23 (26%) met inclusion criteria. A rheumatologist and an orthopedic surgeon independently reviewed each article using a standardized rating scale that scored the assembly of the study, the relevance of the patients enrolled, the appropriateness of the reference standard, and the blinding of the examiner. Summary likelihood ratios (LRs) were estimated from random effects models. The summary LRs for physical examination for tears of the anterior cruciate ligament, using the anterior drawer test, were 3.8 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.7-22.0) for a positive examination and 0.30 (95% CI, 0.05-1.50) for a negative examination; the Lachman test, 25.0 (95% CI, 2.7-651.0) and 0.1 (95% CI, 0.0-0.4); and the composite assessment, 25.0 (95% CI, 2.1-306.0) and 0.04 (95% CI, 0.01-0.48), respectively. The LRs could not be generated for any specific examination maneuver for a posterior cruciate ligament tear, but the composite assessment had an LR of 21.0 (95% CI, 2.1-205.0) for a positive examination and 0.05 (95% CI, 0.01-0.50) for a negative examination. Determination of meniscal lesions, using McMurray test, had an LR of 1.3 (95% CI, 0.9-1.7) for a positive examination and 0.8 (95% CI, 0.6-1.1) for a negative examination; joint line tenderness, 0.9 (95% CI, 0.8-1.0) and 1.1 (95% CI, 1.0-1.3); and the composite assessment, 2.7 (95% CI, 1.4-5.1) and 0.4 (95% CI, 0.2-0.7), respectively. The composite examination for specific meniscal or ligamentous injuries of the knee performed much better than specific maneuvers, suggesting that synthesis of a group of examination maneuvers and historical items may be required for adequate diagnosis.","In another meta-analysis including 9 studies of meniscal injury diagnosis, individual tests for joint line tenderness, joint effusion, the medial-lateral grind test, and the McMurray test failed to yield statistically significant likelihood ratios for the presence or absence of meniscal tears. Positive and negative likelihood ratios for aggregate physical examination were 2.7 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4-5.1) and 0.4 (95% CI, 0.2-0.7), which are statistically, but not clinically, significant values for ruling meniscal lesions in or out."
"Do steroid injections help with osteoarthritis of the knee
To evaluate the safety and efficacy of long-term intraarticular (IA) steroid injections for knee pain related to osteoarthritis (OA). In a randomized, double-blind trial, 68 patients with OA of the knee received IA injections of triamcinolone acetonide 40 mg (34 patients) or saline (34 patients) into the study knee every 3 months for up to 2 years. The primary outcome variable was radiologic progression of joint space narrowing of the injected knee after 2 years. Measurements of minimum joint space width were performed by an automated computerized method on standardized fluoroscopically guided radiographs taken with the patient standing and with the knee in a semiflexed position. The clinical efficacy measure of primary interest was the pain subscale from the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities OA Index (WOMAC). Efficacy measures of secondary interest were the total score on the WOMAC, physician's global assessment, patient's global assessment, patient's assessment of pain, range of motion (ROM) of the affected knee, and 50-foot walking time. Clinical symptoms were assessed just before each injection. At the 1-year and 2-year followup evaluations, no difference was noted between the two treatment groups with respect to loss of joint space over time. The steroid-injected knees showed a trend toward greater symptom improvement, especially at 1 year, for the WOMAC pain subscale, night pain, and ROM values (P = 0.05) compared with the saline-injected knees. Using area under the curve analyses, knee pain and stiffness were significantly improved throughout the 2-year study by repeated injections of triamcinolone acetonide, but not saline (P < 0.05). Our findings support the long-term safety of IA steroid injections for patients with symptomatic knee OA. No deleterious effects of the long-term administration of IA steroids on the anatomical structure of the knee were noted. Moreover, long-term treatment of knee OA with repeated steroid injections appears to be clinically effective for the relief of symptoms of the disease.","A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial studied the long-term safety and efficacy of treatment of knee osteoarthritis with repeated steroid injections. These investigators studied 66 patients aged 40 to 80 years recruited from rheumatology clinics. One half (n=33) received injections of triamcinolone acetonide 40 mg, and the other half received saline injections every 3 months for 2 years. At 1- and 2-year interval follow-ups, no statistically significant difference was seen between the 2 groups in loss of joint space and no progression of degenerative disease, as demonstrated by measurements of joint space widths by standardized fluoroscopically guided radiographs. Although the primary outcome measure of this study was to assess radiologic joint space narrowing with repeated injections, knee pain and stiffness appeared to improve after 2 years, although these results were not well quantified."
"Do steroid injections help with osteoarthritis of the knee
To show whether intra-articular steroid injections are effective in osteoarthritis; to determine factors that predict response; and to determine whether injection has a beneficial effect on muscle strength. Double blind, placebo controlled, crossover study in 59 patients with symptomatic osteoarthritis of the knee. Outcome measure-Primary outcome measure: change in visual analogue score for pain at three weeks. Predictors of response analysed using logistic regression with a 15% decrease in pain score at three weeks defining response. Intra-articular methyl prednisolone acetate produced a significant reduction in visual analogue pain score at three weeks compared to both baseline (median change -2.0 mm, interquartile range -16.25 to 4.0) and placebo (median 0.0 mm, interquartile range -9.0 to 6.25). No clinical predictors of response could be identified. Muscle strength was not significantly improved in the short term by intra-articular injection. Intra-articular corticosteroids are effective for short term relief of pain in osteoarthritis but predicting responders is not possible. There may be a place for their more widespread use.","In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study, investigators randomized 59 patients aged 51 to 89 years to receive either an intra-articular injection of 1 mL of 40 mg methylprednisolone or 1 mL of 0.9% saline. After 3 weeks, patients receiving steroid injection had a minimal change in baseline visual analogue score for pain compared with those receiving saline (median change: -2.0 mm vs 0 mm on a 100-mm scale)."
"Do TZDs increase the risk of heart failure for patients with diabetes
To compare the incidence of heart failure in individuals with type 2 diabetes receiving thiazolidinediones (TZDs) versus other oral antihyperglycemic agents. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using a health insurance claims database. The study sample included patients with type 2 diabetes who received an oral antihyperglycemic agent between January 1995 and March 2001. Those with any claims for TZDs were designated ""exposed,"" and each was compared with five randomly selected unexposed patients. Those with diagnoses of heart failure or who received digoxin or a diuretic in the year before their index date were excluded. The primary measure of interest was incidence of heart failure, which was defined as a hospitalization or outpatient visit with a diagnosis of heart failure. TZD patients (n = 5441) were younger than control subjects (n = 28103) but more likely to have coronary artery disease or diabetes complications, receive ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, metformin, or insulin, and have undergone HbA(1c) tests or eye exams; they also had more comorbidities and higher costs (all P < 0.05). However, TZD use was predictive of heart failure even after controlling for these variables (hazard ratio = 1.7, P < 0.001). Adjusted incidence of heart failure at 40 months was 8.2% for TZD patients and 5.3% for control subjects. The results of this observational study suggest that TZDs may increase the risk of heart failure. Physicians should use TZDs with caution in patients with heart failure, remain vigilant for manifestations of heart failure in those receiving these drugs (especially patients with cardiovasculopathy), and consider alternate therapies for patients who develop symptoms of heart failure, such as shortness of breath.","A retrospective cohort study of health insurance claims compared the incidence of CHF among 5441 patients with diabetes who had taken TZDs (rosiglitazone, troglitazone, or pioglitazone) vs 28,103 who had not. Patients were allowed other oral agents and insulin, and they were followed for up to 6 years. The TZD group had more patients on insulin and with pre-existing comorbidities. Based on Kaplan-Meier estimates, which control for censored information, the incidence of new heart failure at 40 months was 8.2% in the TZD group and 5.3% in the non-TZD group (number needed to harm [NNH]=34.5). Using a multivariate analysis that controlled for the coadministration of insulin, the hazard ratio for TZD use was 1.76 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.43-2.17). The incidence of CHF was 3.24% in the troglitazone group (n=1665), 2.39% in the rosiglitazone group (n=1882), and 1.63% in the pioglitazone group (n=1347). The difference in these rates is not statistically significant. Of the 28,103 patients not on a TZD, 1.41% developed heart failure. Individual agents were not compared with placebo."
"Do TZDs increase the risk of heart failure for patients with diabetes
Cardiovascular mortality and morbidity are increased in patients with type 2 diabetes. However, there are few data from clinical trials comparing cardiovascular effects of alternative oral anti-diabetic agents. Major cardiovascular outcomes during four one-year, double-blind trials in over 3700 patients with type 2 diabetes randomised to either a thiazolidinedione, pioglitazone, metformin or a sulphonylurea, gliclazide treatment have been combined. Mean blood pressure was slightly reduced by all treatments, with pioglitazone treatment resulting in the largest falls (approximately 1.5 mmHg). Hospitalisations for cardiac or cerebrovascular events were similar with the different treatments. Overall mortality was seven of 1857 for pioglitazone and 10 of 1856 for non-pioglitazone treatments, of which three and six were cardiac deaths, respectively. The incidence of congestive cardiac failure was similar with pioglitazone (12/1857) and non-pioglitazone (10/1856) treatments. The results show similar cardiovascular outcome for the three different treatments over a one-year period, but demonstrate interesting differences, which will require longer-term formal outcome studies to determine their significance.","A manufacturer-sponsored study that combined data from 4 separate unpublished randomized controlled trials compared the incidence of CHF at 1 year for patients treated with pioglitazone (as monotherapy and in combination with other oral agents) with those treated only with other oral agents. Cardiac failure was noted in 12 of 1857 in the pioglitazone group vs 10 of 1856 subjects in the non-pioglitazone groups (not statistically significant). The paper did not comment on how the patients were recruited, how outcomes were measured, or why the 4 original studies were not published."
"What physical exam techniques are useful to detect malingering
To test a new neurological sign, the ""abductor sign,"" which can distinguish between organic and non-organic leg paresis using synergic movements of the bilateral hip abductors. The subjects were 33 patients presenting with paresis of one leg, 17 of organic origin and 16 of non-organic origin (hysteria). To test the abductor sign, the examiner told the patient to abduct each leg, and opposed this movement with his hands placed on the lateral surfaces of the patient's legs. The leg contralateral to the abducted one showed opposite actions for organic paresis and non-organic paresis: for example, when the paretic leg was abducted, the sound leg stayed fixed in organic paresis, but moved in the hyperadducting direction in non-organic paresis. Hoover's sign was used for comparison in the same patients. The abductor sign gave the correct classification for all 33 cases. Hoover's sign was reliable if the results were carefully interpreted, but it was non-diagnostic for 16 patients because of strong hip extensors and in two because of strong hip flexors. Two patients with non-organic paresis succeeded in tricking the examiner by pretending full effort to lift the paretic leg. The abductor sign is a useful test to detect non-organic paresis, because (1) it is difficult for a hysterical patient to deceive the examiner, (2) the hip abductor is one of the most commonly involved muscles in pyramidal weakness, and (3) the results are easily visible as movement or non-movement of the unabducted leg.","In a diagnostic case-control study, the single author tested 33 patients from his practice, 17 with organic paresis, and 16 with nonorganic paresis. The author differentiated organic from nonorganic paresis by history, physical exam, and various imaging studies with no independent assessment. He reported his test as 100% accurate. We did not find any published studies of the Arm Drop test, where feigned paralysis of an upper extremity is tested by holding the arm over the face of the supine patient and letting go."
"For those intolerant to ACE inhibitors and ARBs, what is the best therapy for reducing the risk of diabetic nephropathy
Diabetic patients are considered less suitable than nondiabetic patients for beta-blocker therapy because of the risk for worsened glucose and lipid metabolism and more severe hypoglycemic attacks. To compare the metabolic and cardiovascular effects of carvedilol with those of atenolol in diabetic patients with hypertension. Randomized, double-blind, 24-week trial. University hospital clinic. 45 patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and hypertension. After a 4- to 6-week run-in period during which placebo was given in a single-blind manner, patients were randomly assigned to carvedilol or atenolol. An oral glucose tolerance test; assessment of insulin sensitivity and hormonal responses to insulin hypoglycemia; and assessment of lipid levels, blood pressure, left ventricular mass, and lipid peroxidation. Changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure and left ventricular mass index were similar with carvedilol and atenolol (P > 0.2). Fasting plasma glucose and insulin levels decreased with carvedilol and increased with atenolol. Responses to carvedilol were greater than those to atenolol, as follows: increase in total glucose disposal, 9.54 mumol/kg of body weight per minute (95% CI, 7 to 11.9 mumol/kg per minute); decrease in plasma glucose response to oral glucose, 61 mmol/L x 180 minutes (CI, -101 to -21 mmol/L x 180 minutes); decrease in insulin response to oral glucose, 6.2 nmol/L x 180 minutes (CI, -9.8 to -2.6 nmol/L x 180 minutes); decrease in triglyceride level, 0.56 mmol/L (CI, -0.75 to -0.37 mmol/L; P < 0.001); increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level, 0.13 mmol/L (CI, 0.09 to 0.17 mmol/L; P < 0.001); and decrease in lipid peroxidation, 0.25 mumol/L (CI, -0.34 to -0.16 mumol/L). By improving glucose and lipid metabolism and reducing lipid peroxidation, carvedilol may offer advantages in patients with diabetes and hypertension.","Selective beta-blockers like carvedilol appear to have fewer adverse metabolic effects, although the clinical significance of this difference is unclear. In insulin-dependent patients and patients with hypoglycemic episodes, peripheral vascular disease, and bronchospastic disease, beta-blockers should be used with caution."
"Should we recommend universal neonatal hearing screening
The principal factors that decide how deafness affects a child's development are the degree of hearing impairment and the age at which it is diagnosed. A number of factors are thought to increase the risk of hearing impairment: low birth weight, prematurity, perinatal hypoxia and jaundice, among others. The high incidence of deafness in children without risk factors and the introduction of simple new screening tests of high sensitivity and specificity has led many prestigious bodies to recommend universal early detection programmes for deafness rather than screening targeted only at high-risk groups. To compare the long-term effectiveness of a universal neonatal screening and early treatment programme for hearing impairment with: a) screening and treatment only of high-risk neonates and b) opportunistic screening and treatment. Databases searched were MEDLINE (1966 to 2003), EMBASE (1974 to 2003), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2004) and registers of health technology assessment agencies as well as registers of clinical guidelines. Randomised controlled trials comparing universal neonatal screening with either high-risk screening or opportunistic screening for hearing impairment. Two review authors independently screened the search results to identify suitable trials. No studies were identified which fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The long-term effectiveness of universal newborn hearing screening programmes has not been established to date. There is a need for controlled trials and before and after studies to address this issue further.",The Cochrane Collaboration published a systematic review in which no studies were found that fulfilled the inclusion criteria to evaluate the effectiveness of universal hearing screening.
"What is the best management for patients with evidence of asymptomatic ischemia on exercise stress testing
Ample evidence now exists supporting the use of the exercise test primarily for prognostic, as opposed to diagnostic, purposes. Although limitations must be recognized, the Duke exercise treadmill score, the chronotropic response to exercise, and heart rate recovery appear to function as powerful and independent predictors of risk. With the possible exception of exercise-induced ischemia, as manifested by the ST-segment and angina components of the Duke exercise treadmill score, exercise predictors of risk are not clearly modifiable. Nonetheless, they are clinically quite useful since they may well identify patients who are or are not likely to gain benefit from further testing and aggressive therapies. How so? The ""plain old"" exercise treadmill test makes it possible to easily, safely, and inexpensively identify a large group of patients who are at low risk for death or major cardiac events. For this reason alone, the predictive instruments described in this article should be routinely incorporated into clinical practice. It makes no sense to perform expensive and potentially risky diagnostic tests, prescribe polypharmacy, or institute invasive therapeutic procedures in patients who are already at low risk. As an example, Weiner and colleagues found that coronary bypass grafting only benefited CASS registry patients who had a high-risk exercise test result. Future research will be needed to further refine risk stratification with the exercise test, and determine how best to use adjunctive imaging studies and to reduce risk among patients with prognostically important findings.",Post-EST heart rate recovery and the Chronotropic Index are enhancements to the DTS.
"What is the best management for patients with evidence of asymptomatic ischemia on exercise stress testing
The treadmill exercise test identifies patients with different degrees of risk of death from cardiovascular events. We devised a prognostic score, based on the results of treadmill exercise testing, that accurately predicts outcome among inpatients referred for cardiac catheterization. This study was designed to determine whether this score could also accurately predict prognosis in unselected outpatients. We prospectively studied 613 consecutive outpatients with suspected coronary disease who were referred for exercise testing between 1983 and 1985. Follow-up was 98 percent complete at four years. The treadmill score was calculated as follows: duration of exercise in minutes--(5 x the maximal ST-segment deviation during or after exercise, in millimeters)--(4 x the treadmill angina index). The numerical treadmill angina index was 0 for no angina, 1 for nonlimiting angina, and 2 for exercise-limiting angina. Treadmill scores ranged from -25 (indicating the highest risk) to +15 (indicating the lowest risk). Predicted outcomes for the outpatients, based on their treadmill scores, agreed closely with the observed outcomes. The score accurately separated patients who subsequently died from those who lived for four years (area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve = 0.849). The treadmill score was a better discriminator than the clinical data and was even more useful for outpatients than it had been for inpatients. Approximately two thirds of the outpatients had treadmill scores indicating low risk (greater than or equal to +5), reflecting longer exercise times and little or no ST-segment deviation, and their four-year survival rate was 99 percent (average annual mortality rate, 0.25 percent). Four percent of the outpatients had scores indicating high risk (less than -10), reflecting shorter exercise times and more severe ST-segment deviation; their four-year survival rate was 79 percent (average annual mortality rate, 5 percent). The treadmill score is a useful and valid tool that can help clinicians determine prognosis and decide whether to refer outpatients with suspected coronary disease for cardiac catheterization. In this study, it was a better predictor of outcome than the clinical assessment.","A prospective cohort study of 613 patients with suspected coronary artery disease investigated EST duration, presence of angina, and ST-segment depression as predictors of mortality. Patients with asymptomatic ischemia (2 mm of ischemic depression) whose EST lasted 15 minutes (DTS=+5, low risk) had a 5-year cardiac mortality of less than 1%, compared with 2% for those whose EST was tolerated for only 7 minutes (DTS=-3, intermediate risk)."
"Do testosterone injections increase libido for elderly hypogonadal patients
From an initial group of 39, 16 cycling peri-menopausal women completed a longitudinal study in which they recorded menstrual and sexual behavior daily and were interviewed at roughly 4-mth intervals until 1 yr or more without cycling. At each interview women gave 20-ml blood samples, completed sexuality questionnaires, and rated themselves for menopausal symptoms. As predicted, the difference in weekly rate of sexual intercourse before and after the cycle showed a significant decline (P less than 0.05). For each subject, mean weekly rates of sexual intercourse for 13-wk periods over the entire transition period were plotted and the slope of the line was calculated. Overall, the mean slope was negative, as predicted, and was significantly different from zero (P less than 0.05). The questionnaire data showed that compared with their pre-menopause data, the women had fewer sexual thoughts or fantasies (P less than 0.01), suffered more from lack of vaginal lubrication during sex (P less than 0.01), and were less satisfied with their partners as lovers (P less than 0.05) after menopause. While estradiol (E) and testosterone (T) levels showed significant declines (P less than 0.02), testosterone showed the most consistent association with coital frequency. The findings generally supported our initial hypothesis of a decline in sexual interest and coital frequency after menopause.",Low testosterone level is correlated with a decreased coital frequency.
"How useful are autoantibodies in diagnosing thyroid disorders
Stimulating thyrotrophin receptor antibodies (TRAbs) have been identified as the antibodies responsible for the pathogenesis of Graves' disease (GD) while blocking TRAbs have been implicated as the cause of hypothyroidism in some patients with chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis (CLT). TRAb positivity in patients with other thyroid disorders such as silent thyroiditis, toxic multinodular goitre and subacute thyroiditis has been reported but the role of TRAb in these disorders is unclear. A study was carried out to determine the prevalence of TRAb positivity in Singaporean patients with a spectrum of thyroid diseases. TRAb levels were measured in 181 patients with GD, 54 patients with CLT (37 goitrous and 17 agoitrous), 16 patients with thyroid nodules, 11 patients with subacute thyroiditis, 1 patient with hyperthyroidism due to a human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG)-secreting tumour, 2 patients with thyroid stimulating hormone-secreting tumours and 2 patients with amiodarone-induced dysthyroidism. Using a cut-off of 10.0 U/L, TRAb levels were found to be positive in 79.0% of GD patients, 9.2% of CLT patients (euthyroid and hypothyroid) and no patients with other thyroid disorders. TRAb was a more sensitive marker of GD than anti-thyroglobulin antibodies (53.2%) but not anti-microsomal (78.3%) antibodies. TRAb levels > 10.0 U/L appear to be highly specific for autoimmune thyroid disease.","A cross-sectional study of 267 Singaporean patients with previously diagnosed thyroid disorders measured TRAb, AMA, and thyroglobulin. TRAb levels >10 U/L were found to have a positive likelihood ratio (LR+) of 13 and a negative likelihood ratio (LR-) of 0.2 for Graves' disease."
"Which lab tests are best when you suspect hypothyroidism
As there are few data on the evaluation of the adequacy of levothyroxine (L-T4) therapy in patients with central hypothyroidism (CH), a prospective study was performed to assess the accuracy of various parameters in the follow-up of 37 CH patients. Total and free thyroid hormones, TSH, and a series of clinical and biochemical indexes of peripheral thyroid hormone action have been evaluated off and on L-T4 therapy. Samples were taken before the daily administration of L-T4. In all patients off therapy, clinical hypothyroidism and low levels of free T4 (FT4) were observed, whereas values of FT3, total T4, and total T3 were below the normal range in 73%, 57%, and 19% of cases, respectively. Most of the indexes of thyroid hormone action were significantly modified after L-T4 withdrawal and exhibited significant correlation with free thyroid hormone levels. During L-T4 replacement therapy, 32 patients had circulating levels of FT4 and FT3 and indexes within the normal range with a mean L-T4 daily dose of 1.5 +/- 0.3 microg/kg BW. Despite normal serum FT4, 3 patients had borderline high values of FT3 and a clear elevation of serum-soluble interleukin-2 receptor concentrations, suggesting overtreatment. Low or borderline low FT4/FT3 levels indicated undertreatment in 2 patients. The clinical parameters lack the required specificity for the diagnosis or follow-up of CH patients. The L-T4 daily dose should be established, taking into account the weight, the age, and the presence of other hormone deficiencies or pharmacological treatment of CH patients. In conclusion, our results indicate that the diagnosis of CH is reached at best by measuring TSH and FT4 concentrations. In the evaluation of the adequacy of L-T4 replacement therapy, both FT4 and FT3 serum levels together with some biochemical indexes of thyroid hormone action are all necessary to a more accurate disclosure of over- or undertreated patients.","TSH can't be used to monitor therapy for central hypothyroidism. Follow both free T4 and T3 concentrations because elevated T3 levels, indicative of overtreatment, can occur even when free T4 measurements are normal in these patients."
"What drugs are best for bipolar depression
This study reviewed the evidence from randomized, controlled trials on the efficacy and safety of antidepressants in the short-term treatment of bipolar depression. The authors performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials. They searched the Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety, and Neurosis Controlled Trials Register, incorporating results of searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycLIT, PSYNDEX, and LILACS. The main outcome measures were the proportion of patients who clinically responded to treatment and the rate of switching to mania. Twelve randomized trials were included, with a total of 1,088 randomly assigned patients. Five trials compared one or more antidepressants with placebo: 75% of these patients were receiving a concurrent mood stabilizer or an atypical antipsychotic. Antidepressants were more effective than placebo. Antidepressants did not induce more switching to mania (the event rate for antidepressants was 3.8% and for placebo, it was 4.7%). Six trials allowed comparison between two antidepressants. The rate of switching for tricyclic antidepressants was 10%, and for all other antidepressants combined, it was 3.2%. Antidepressants are effective in the short-term treatment of bipolar depression. The trial data do not suggest that switching is a common early complication of treatment with antidepressants. It may be prudent to use a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or a monoamine oxidase inhibitor rather than a tricyclic antidepressant as first-line treatment. Given the limited evidence, there is a compelling need for further studies with longer follow-up periods and careful definition and follow-up of emerging mania and partial remission.","A systematic review of 4 RCTs (662 patients) found that antidepressants-fluoxetine, paroxetine, imipramine, tranylcypromine, and selegiline (ldeprenyl)-significantly increased treatment response for bipolar type I or II disease at 4 to 10 weeks. About 75% of patients received a concurrent mood stabilizer or an atypical antipsychotic (relative risk [RR]=1.86; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.49-2.30; number needed to treat=4.2; 95% CI, 3.2-6.4).1 Although a few head-to-head comparisons suggested that some SSRIs and monoamine oxidase inhibitors are more effective first-line agents than tricyclics, the differences were not significant."
"What drugs are best for bipolar depression
Improving patients' health-related quality of life (HRQOL) could be a treatment goal for bipolar depression. The objectives of these secondary analyses of a previous report were to determine the benefits of olanzapine alone and olanzapine-fluoxetine combination (OFC) for improving HRQOL in patients with bipolar depression using both a generic and a depression-specific HRQOL instrument, and to examine the association between the 2 HRQOL instruments and the construct validity of the depression-specific HRQOL instrument. This was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, 83-site, international, randomized trial. Adults with bipolar I disorder, most recent episode depressed (according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition), were randomly assigned to receive olanzapine (6-20 mg/d), OFC (6/25, 12/25, or 12/50 mg/d), or placebo for 8 weeks. HRQOL improvement was calculated as last-observation-carried-forward changes in dimension and component summary scores on Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) and total score on the Quality of Life in Depression Scale (QLDS). Results: Patients were assigned to receive olanzapine (n = 370), [corrected] OFC (n = 86), or placebo (n = 377) [corrected] for 8 weeks. Of 833 enrolled patients, 454 discontinued (olanzapine, 191/370 [51.6%] [corrected]OFC, 31/86 [36.0%]; and placebo, 232/377 [61.6%]) [corrected] Compared with placebo, olanzapine-treated patients exhibited greater improvements on SF-36 mental component summary (MCS) score ( P=0.002) and 3 of 8 SF-36 dimension scores (mental health [P=0.015], role-emotional [P=0.046], and social functioning [P=0.006). OFC-treated patients exhibited greater improvements on MCS score ( P<0.001) vs both placebo and olanzapine), 5 SF-36 dimension scores (general health perception (P<0.001) vs placebo; (P<0.001) vs olanzapinel, mental health [ P=0.001] vs both placebo and olanzapine], role-emotional [ P<0.001] vs placebo; [P=0.007] vs olanzapine], social functioning [ P=0.001] vs placebo; [P=0.032] vs olanzapine], and vitality [P=0.002] vs placebo; [P=0.011] vs olanzapine]), and QLDS total score ( P<0.001] vs both placebo and olanzapine). Changes in SF-36 scores of mental health, social functioning, role-emotional, and vitality were highly correlated to changes in the QLDS total score (all p < -0.5). Based on these analyses, patients with bipolar depression receiving olanzapine or OFC for 8 weeks had greater improvement in HRQOL than those receiving placebo. OFC treatment was associated with greater improvement in HRQOL than olanzapine alone. The correlation results support the construct validity of the QLDS.","A secondary analysis assessed health-related quality of life based on the Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) and Quality of Life in Depression Scale (QLDS). OFC treated patients showed greater improvements in general health perception, social functioning, vitality, and a number of other depression markers compared with both the olanzapine monotherapy and placebo groups. However, the SF-36 and QLDS were administered in only 7 of 13 participating countries, possibly skewing results because of variations between countries in sociocultural factors and quality-of-life issues that may also affect mental health."
"What drugs are best for bipolar depression
Despite the longer duration of the depressive phase in bipolar disorder and the frequent clinical use of antidepressants combined with antipsychotics or mood stabilizers, relatively few controlled studies have examined treatment strategies for bipolar depression. To examine the use of olanzapine and olanzapine-fluoxetine combination in the treatment of bipolar I depression. Double-blind, 8-week, randomized controlled trial. Eighty-four sites (inpatient and outpatient) in 13 countries. Patients A total of 833 randomized adults with bipolar I depression with a Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score of at least 20. Intervention Patients were randomly assigned to receive placebo (n = 377); olanzapine, 5 to 20 mg/d (n = 370); or olanzapine-fluoxetine combination, 6 and 25, 6 and 50, or 12 and 50 mg/d (n = 86). Changes in MADRS total scores using mixed-effects model repeated-measures analyses. During all 8 study weeks, the olanzapine and olanzapine-fluoxetine groups showed statistically significant improvement in depressive symptoms vs the placebo group (P<.001 for all). The olanzapine-fluoxetine group also showed statistically greater improvement than the olanzapine group at weeks 4 through 8. At week 8, MADRS total scores were lower than at baseline by 11.9, 15.0, and 18.5 points in the placebo, olanzapine, and olanzapine-fluoxetine groups, respectively. Remission criteria were met by 24.5% (87/355) of the placebo group, 32.8% (115/351) of the olanzapine group, and 48.8% (40/82) of the olanzapine-fluoxetine group. Treatment-emergent mania (Young Mania Rating Scale score <15 at baseline and > or =15 subsequently) did not differ among groups (placebo, 6.7% [23/345]; olanzapine, 5.7% [19/335]; and olanzapine-fluoxetine, 6.4% [5/78]). Adverse events for olanzapine-fluoxetine therapy were similar to those for olanzapine therapy but also included higher rates of nausea and diarrhea. Olanzapine is more effective than placebo, and combined olanzapine-fluoxetine is more effective than olanzapine and placebo in the treatment of bipolar I depression without increased risk of developing manic symptoms.","In a double-blind, 8-week RCT involving 84 international sites, 833 adults with bipolar I depression (MADRS score of ≥20) received olanzapine, an olanzapinefluoxetine combination (OFC), or placebo. Although the trial had a low completion rate (38.5%) and no fluoxetine monotherapy arm, the olanzapine and OFC groups showed improvement in depressive symptoms (defined as ≥50% improvement in the MADRS total score). The olanzapine response rate was 39% (P<.02; odds ratio [OR]=1.46; 95% CI, 1.07-2.00); the OFC response rate was 56.1% (P<.001; OR=2.92; 95% CI, 1.23-3.26). The OFC group showed statistically greater improvement than the olanzapine group."
"Can recombinant growth hormone effectively treat idiopathic short stature
To review the indication, pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and adverse effects of recombinant human growth hormone in children with idiopathic short stature (ISS). A MEDLINE search (1966-December 2003) was performed using the key words human growth hormone, somatropin, Humatrope, normal children, somatrem, and idiopathic short stature. Food and Drug Administration Advisory Committee Meeting minutes were also reviewed. The data presented in this review were obtained from published literature, abstracts presented at scientific meetings, and information on file with the manufacturer. Additional articles from these sources were also identified. Current issues of pediatric and endocrinology journals were reviewed for the most recent articles. Articles only addressing the use of growth hormone in normal, healthy children were used. Somatropin is indicated for use in children with ISS. Studies have shown modest benefit to final height achieved and, at the doses used for ISS, there have been no adverse effects associated with somatropin. Many questions still exist, however, concerning the most appropriate age to initiate treatment and duration of treatment. There are also many ethical concerns surrounding patient selection criteria and potential for increased off-label use. Growth hormone has been found to have modest efficacy in improving final height in children with ISS. The specific patient population likely to achieve maximal benefit, optimal dosage regimens, and the long-term adverse effects of extended duration of therapy are unknown.","rGH has been available since 1985. The Food and Drug Administration has approved it for such conditions as growth hormone deficiency, chronic renal insufficiency, Turner syndrome, small size for gestational age, and Prader-Willi syndrome. The use of rGH to treat idiopathic short stature introduces many clinical, economic, and ethical questions. We have attempted to discern the clinical effectiveness of treatment by focusing on RCTs of rGH therapy while leaving the other substantive issues unexplored."
"Is there a well-tested tool to detect drug-seeking behaviors in chronic pain patients
To provide clinicians with a brief screening tool to predict accurately which individuals may develop aberrant behaviors when prescribed opioids for chronic pain. One hundred and eighty-five consecutive new patients treated in one pain clinic took the self-administered Opioid Risk Tool (ORT). The ORT measured the following risk factors associated in scientific literature with substance abuse: personal and family history of substance abuse; age; history of preadolescent sexual abuse; and certain psychological diseases. Patients received scores of 0-3 (low risk), 4-7 (moderate risk), or >or= 8 (high risk), indicating the probability of their displaying opioid-related aberrant behaviors. All patients were monitored for aberrant behaviors for 12 months after their initial visits. For those patients with a risk category of low, 17 out of 18 (94.4%) did not display an aberrant behavior. For those patients with a risk category of high, 40 out of 44 (90.9%) did display an aberrant behavior. The authors used the c statistic to validate the ORT, because it simultaneously assesses sensitivity and specificity. The ORT displayed excellent discrimination for both the male (c = 0.82) and the female (c = 0.85) prognostic models. In a preliminary study, among patients prescribed opioids for chronic pain, the ORT exhibited a high degree of sensitivity and specificity for determining which individuals are at risk for opioid-related, aberrant behaviors. Further studies in a variety of pain and nonpain settings are needed to determine the ORT's universal applicability.",The ORT study lacked standard measures of addiction.
"Which treatments are effective for cervical radiculopathy
Thirty-two patients underwent periradicular corticosteroid injections with a lateral percutaneous approach under fluoroscopic guidance, to treat 34 foci of chronic cervical radiculopathy unresponsive to medical treatment alone. The mean evolutionary trends for radicular and neck pain relief were significant at 14 days (P <.001) and at 6 months (P <.001). The procedure did not produce any complications.","A series of 32 patients who had failed conventional treatment showed a 62% response-defined as ""good or excellent"" pain relief-to epidural steroid injection at 14 days. At 6 months, 53% continued to report good or excellent pain relief. No significant side effects occurred. The 44% of patients who didn't report success also didn't report any further deterioration."
"Should we screen for ovarian cancer
The value of screening for ovarian cancer is uncertain. We did a pilot randomised trial to assess multimodal screening with sequential CA 125 antigen and ultrasonography. Postmenopausal women aged 45 years or older were randomised to a control group (n=10,977) or screened group (n=10,958). Women randomised to screening were offered three annual screens that involved measurement of serum CA 125, pelvic ultrasonography if CA 125 was 30 U/mL or more, and referral for gynaecological opinion if ovarian volume was 8.8 mL or more on ultrasonography. All women were followed up to see whether they developed invasive epithelial cancers of the ovary or fallopian tube (index cancers). Of 468 women in the screened group with a raised CA 125, 29 were referred for a gynaecological opinion; screening detected an index cancer in six and 23 had false-positive screening results. The positive predictive value was 20.7%. During 7-year follow-up, ten further women with index cancers were identified in the screened group and 20 in the control group. Median survival of women with index cancers in the screened group was 72.9 months and in the control group was 41.8 months (p=0.0112). The number of deaths from an index cancer did not differ significantly between the control and screened groups (18 of 10,977 vs nine of 10,958, relative risk 2.0 [95% CI 0.78-5.13]). These results show that a multimodal approach to ovarian cancer screening in a randomised trial is feasible and justify a larger randomised trial to see whether screening affects mortality.","A large pilot study showed improved median survival in a screened group compared with a control group (72.9 months vs 41.8 months), but there was no significant difference in either mortality from ovarian cancer or all-cause mortality."
"Are nasal steroid sprays effective for otitis media with effusion
Description of the natural course of otitis media with effusion (OME) in pre-school children. Longitudinal follow-up study. Nijmegen, the Netherlands; at the children's home address. A cohort of 1439 children born in the period September 1982 to August 1983 and living in Nijmegen at their second birthday were invited for participation in serial tympanometric screening with a three-monthly interval. Each child was measured 9 times from age 24 to 48 months. A flat tympanogram was considered to be indicative of OME. Participation was 92%, but interpretable tympanograms were taken in 2242 ears (first round) to 1990 ears (last screening). Data of 56 children treated with grommets were excluded from analysis. Longstanding OME (at least 4 flat tympanograms in a succession) was seen in 9.3% (95%-CI 7.0-11.6) of ears. In another 23.4% (20.1-26.8) of ears OME was found 2 or 3 times at subsequent screenings. Single or recurrent flat tympanograms were seen in 20.4% (17.2-23.6) and 11.6% (9.0-14.1) of the ears respectively. The probability of recovery over time was well described with a simple function of a 50% improvement every 3 months. In addition, 50% of the recovered ears showed one or more recurrences of OME. OME appears to run a very fluctuating course with a strong representation of short disease episodes and high rates of recovery and remission. The data confirm the results of others. A common interpretation, i.e. a sharp reduction of the recovery rate after three months, appears to be false. A 50% improvement rate every 3 months fits the data equally well. This study does not provide information about the sequelae of OME at school age.",The natural course of OME was observed in a longitudinal cohort study of 1439 children aged 2 years in the Netherlands. Single or recurrent flat screening tympanograms were noted in 20% and remitted spontaneously at a rate of 50% every 3 months. This prevalence and spontaneous resolution rate is consistent with other studies.
"Does glucosamine relieve arthritis joint pain
Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis, and it is often associated with significant disability and an impaired quality of life. To review all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the effectiveness and toxicity of glucosamine in osteoarthritis (OA). We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and Current Contents up to November 1999, and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register. We also wrote letters to content experts, and hand searched reference lists of identified RCTs and pertinent review articles. Relevant studies met the following criteria: 1) RCTs evaluating the effectiveness and safety of glucosamine in OA, 2) Both placebo based and comparative studies were eligible, 3) Both single blinded and double-blinded studies were eligible. Data abstraction was performed independently by two investigators and the results were compared for degree of agreement. Gotzsche's method and a validated tool (Jadad 1995) were used to score the quality of the RCTs. Continuous outcome measures were pooled using standardized mean differences. Dichotomous outcome measures were pooled using Peto Odds Ratios. Collectively, the 16 identified RCTs provided evidence that glucosamine is both effective and safe in OA. In the 13 RCTs in which glucosamine was compared to placebo, glucosamine was found to be superior in all RCTs, except one. In the four RCTs in which glucosamine was compared to an NSAID, glucosamine was superior in two, and equivalent in two. Further research is necessary to confirm the long term effectiveness and toxicity of glucosamine therapy in OA. Most of the trials reviewed only evaluated the Rotta preparation of glucosamine sulfate. It is not known whether different glucosamine preparations prepared by different manufacturers are equally effective in the therapy of OA.","Typical trends suggest that glucosamine is superior to placebo for pain relief, and less effective but safer than nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents."
"What is the best test to detect herpes in skin lesions
The sensitivity of a rapid enzyme immunoassay test (HerpChek Direct Herpes Simplex Virus Antigen Test [DuPont Medical Products, Wilmington, Del.]) for the detection of herpes simplex virus (HSV) antigens in patient specimens was compared with HSV culture. HerpChek positivity for HSV occurred with 179 (65%) of 275 lesion specimens, whereas culture for HSV was positive for 145 (53%) lesions (P = 0.002). HerpChek was twice as sensitive as culture for the detection of HSV in late-stage lesions and was equivalent to culture for the detection of HSV in early lesions. We conclude that HerpChek provides greater sensitivity than culture for HSV detection in late-stage genital lesions.","In a study using 275 samples from genital lesions, HSV was detected in 65% of the antigen tests and 53% of the viral cultures. The sensitivity of this method is equal to culture for early lesions, but much higher in late-stage lesions (58% vs 26%)."
"How long is expectant management safe in first-trimester miscarriage
This study of patients with first trimester miscarriage evaluates whether conservative management is a feasible strategy and assesses the value of colour Doppler ultrasonography for patient selection. After confirmation of the diagnosis by transvaginal sonography all patients were offered the choice of immediate dilatation and curettage or conservative management. The presence of a gestational sac, the occurrence of spontaneous complete miscarriage within 28 days, detectable pulsatile blood flow within the placenta in the presumed region of the intervillous space and post-treatment complications were the main end-points. Out of a total of 108 women recruited, 23 (21.3%) elected to undergo immediate dilatation and curettage and 85 (78.7%) chose conservative management. The treatment groups were similar in age, gestational age, gestational sac diameter, serum concentrations of human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG) and progesterone, and proportion of patients who had post-treatment complications (12-13%). Of patients in the conservative management group, 71 out of 85 (84%) had a spontaneous, complete abortion, while 37 out of 46 cases (80%) with detectable presumed intervillous pulsatile blood flow had a complete, spontaneous abortion within 1 week; this occurred in 23% of cases with no detectable flow. This suggests that conservative management is a successful approach for many patients with first trimester miscarriage; colour Doppler ultrasonography can be used to select the most suitable patients for this strategy, and thus reduce the need for hospital admission and surgery.",An observational study evaluated 108 women with first-trimester missed abortions or anembryonic pregnancies who chose either expectant (85 women) or surgical management. They were followed with weekly ultrasound (including color Doppler imaging) and serum β-hCG for up to 1 month. Fifty-three (62%) completed a spontaneous abortion at 14 days and 71 (84%) at 28 days. There were no significant differences in the rate of complications.
"How long is expectant management safe in first-trimester miscarriage
Early pregnancy loss is a profound adverse life event for many women, and increased psychiatric morbidity has been shown to occur after spontaneous abortion. Dilatation and curettage (D&C) has been the cornerstone in the treatment of first trimester spontaneous abortion over the last few decades. During recent years the possibility of conservative management has, however, been increasingly discussed. In a prospective randomized trial, we compared psychological reactions and morbidity, after either expectant management or D&C, for miscarriages of < 13 weeks gestation in which a transvaginal ultrasound examination showed intrauterine tissue and/or blood clots with an antero-posterior diameter of between 15 and 50 mm. Of the 86 patients included, 58 were randomized to expectant management and 28 to primary D&C. In patients randomized to expectant management, pregnancy products shown by transvaginal ultrasound disappeared within 3 days in 43 cases (74%), whereas 15 patients (26%) underwent D&C owing to retained products of conception after 3 days. At 2 weeks after inclusion, all patients answered self-administered questionnaires, including visual analogue scales, concerning their experience of the pregnancy loss, the present situation and concerns about the future. A brief anxiety status inventory was included. This study showed no increase in anxiety or depressive reactions 2 weeks after a first trimester spontaneous abortion when these patients were compared with non-pregnant healthy working females 19-39 years of age. Moreover, there were no significant differences in psychological reactions between patients managed either expectantly or by D&C.","A prospective trial compared psychological morbidity for 86 women with ultrasound-confirmed first-trimester missed abortions, randomized to expectant or surgical management. At 2 weeks, a self-administered questionnaire about the experience of pregnancy loss found no significant difference in psychological reactions. No increase was seen in anxiety or depression symptoms between women who had miscarried and healthy nonpregnant working women aged 19 to 39 years."
"How long is expectant management safe in first-trimester miscarriage
To evaluate the uptake and outcome of expectant management of spontaneous first trimester miscarriage in an early pregnancy assessment unit. 1096 consecutive patients with a diagnosis of spontaneous first trimester miscarriage. Each miscarriage was classified as complete, incomplete, missed, or anembryonic on the basis of ultrasonography. Women who needed treatment were given the choice of expectant management or surgical evacuation of retained products of conception under general anaesthesia. Women undergoing expectant management were checked a few days after transvaginal bleeding had stopped, or they were monitored at weekly intervals for four weeks. A complete miscarriage (absence of transvaginal bleeding and endometrial thickness <15 mm), the number of women completing their miscarriage within each week of management, and complications (excessive pain or transvaginal bleeding necessitating hospital admission or clinical evidence of infection). Two patients with molar pregnancies were excluded, and 37% of the remainder (408/1094) were classified as having had a complete miscarriage. 70% (478/686) of women with retained products of conception chose expectant management; of these, 27 (6%) were lost to follow up. A successful outcome without surgical intervention was seen in 81% of cases (367/451). The rate of spontaneous completion was 91% (201/221) for those cases classified as incomplete miscarriage, 76% (105/138) for missed miscarriage, and 66% (61/92) for anembryonic pregnancy. 70% of women completed their miscarriage within 14 days of classification (84% for incomplete miscarriage and 52% for missed miscarriage and anembryonic pregnancy). Most women with retained products of conception chose expectant management. Ultrasonography can be used to advise patients on the likelihood that their miscarriage will complete spontaneously within a given time.","Expert opinion recommends that women with spontaneous abortion beyond 13 weeks, a temperature >100.4º F, unstable blood pressure, uncontrolled vaginal bleeding, or evidence of endometritis or pelvic inflammatory disease should have surgical evacuation."
"Should we treat elevated cholesterol in elderly patients
The effect of cholesterol-lowering therapy on death from coronary heart disease in older patients with previous coronary heart disease and average cholesterol levels is uncertain. To compare the relative and absolute effects of pravastatin on cardiovascular disease outcomes in patients with coronary heart disease who are 65 years of age or older with those in patients 31 to 64 years of age. Subgroup analysis of a randomized, placebo-controlled trial. 87 centers in Australia and New Zealand. 3514 patients 65 to 75 years of age, chosen from among 9014 patients with previous myocardial infarction or unstable angina and a baseline plasma cholesterol level of 4.0 to 7.0 mmol/L (155 to 271 mg/dL). Pravastatin, 40 mg/d, or placebo. Major cardiovascular disease events over 6 years. Older patients were at greater risk than younger patients (31 to 64 years of age) for death (20.6% vs. 9.8%), myocardial infarction (11.4% vs. 9.5%), unstable angina (26.7% vs. 23.2%), and stroke (6.7% vs. 3.1%) (all P < 0.001). Pravastatin reduced the risk for all cardiovascular disease events, and similar relative effects were observed in older and younger patients. In patients 65 to 75 years of age, pravastatin therapy reduced mortality by 21% (CI, 7% to 32%), death from coronary heart disease by 24% (CI, 7% to 38%), coronary heart disease death or nonfatal myocardial infarction by 22% (CI, 9% to 34%), myocardial infarction by 26% (CI, 9% to 40%), and stroke by 12% (CI, -15% to 32%). For every 1000 older patients treated over 6 years, pravastatin prevented 45 deaths, 33 myocardial infarctions, 32 unstable angina events, 34 coronary revascularization procedures, 13 strokes, or 133 major cardiovascular events, compared with 22 deaths and 107 major cardiovascular events per 1000 younger patients. Among older patients, the numbers needed to treat were 22 (CI, 17 to 36) to prevent one death from any cause, 35 (CI, 24 to 67) to prevent one death from coronary heart disease, and 21 (CI, 17 to 31) to prevent one coronary heart disease death or nonfatal myocardial infarction. In older patients with coronary heart disease and average or moderately elevated cholesterol levels, pravastatin therapy reduced the risk for all major cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality. Since older patients are at greater risk than younger patients for these events, the absolute benefit of treatment is significantly greater in older patients.","The overall decrease in absolute risk of death was similar (range, 4.1%-6.2%; numbers needed to treat [NNT] = 17-25). The LIPID trial demonstrated a reduction in CHD-related death (relative risk [RR] = 0.76; 95% CI, 0.62-0.93; NNT = 37) and myocardial infarctions (RR = 0.74; 95% CI, 0.60-0.91; NNT = 36) in elderly patients taking pravastatin 40 mg once daily for 6 years compared with placebo."
"What is the most effective way for relieving constipation in children aged >1 year
Polyethylene glycol (PEG) 3350 and lactulose were compared in an unblinded, randomized, crossover design for treatment of constipation in 37 children aged 2 to 16 years. Subjects received lactulose (1.3 g/kg/d divided twice daily up to 20 g) or PEG 3350 (10 g/m2/day) for 2 weeks. PEG 3350 significantly decreased the total colonic transit time compared to lactulose (47.6+/-2.7 vs 55.3+/-2.4 hours, mean +/- SE, PEG 3350 vs lactulose, respectively, p = 0.038). The stool frequency, form, and the ease of passage were similar for each laxative. Polyethylene glycol 3350 is an effective laxative for the treatment of chronic constipation in children.","Laxative therapies were compared in 2 studies. An unblinded, randomized, crossover trial enrolled 37 children referred for subspecialty evaluation of functional constipation. It found that PEG 3350 and lactulose were equivalent in improving stool frequency, stool form, and ease of passage. However, there was a significant difference in total stool transit time in subjects taking PEG compared with those taking lactulose (47.6 hours vs 55.3 hours, respectively; P=.038). In addition, twice as many parents and guardians rated PEG effective as those rating lactulose effective (84% vs 46%); and 73% of parents preferred PEG to lactulose."
"What is the most effective way for relieving constipation in children aged >1 year
Chronic constipation is one of the most common disorders in Western countries and despite numerous clinical, pathophysiologic, and epidemiologic studies its cause is still unclear. Several hypotheses have been proposed and according to experimental studies and clinical observation, fiber intake could play a role in its pathogenesis. The purpose of this case-control study was to examine the possible correlation of idiopathic chronic constipation in children and dietary intake, particularly fiber intake. A randomized sample of children (291 children with constipation and 1602 controls) aged 2 to 14 years was taken from three of the 52 counties of Greece. Stratification was performed on the basis of urban, rural, or suburban location and socioeconomic status. The nutritional data were obtained from a 3-day dietary record and a dietary history. Statistical analysis was performed with multivariate tests, multivariate analysis of variance, discriminant analysis, and chi-square analysis according to the characteristics of the correlated variables. Constipated children had a lower caloric and nutrient intake (p < 0.001), lower body weight/height (p < 0.001), and higher prevalence of reported anorexia (p < 0.001). Discriminant analysis indicated that dietary fiber alone was independently negatively correlated with chronic constipation, despite the age and the age of onset of constipation. Relative risk also had a negative correlation with fiber intake (p < 0.001). Of the main fiber fractions only cellulose and pentose were independently correlated with chronic constipation. Lack of fiber may play an important role in the etiology of chronic idiopathic constipation in children.","A case-control study evaluated 291 subjects with constipation and compared their diet with 1602 controls. Mean daily fiber intake was lower in the constipation group. Compared with fiber intake of more than 29 g/d, the relative risk was 8.0 for fiber intake of less than 12.4 g/d."
"First- or second-generation antihistamines: which are more effective at controlling pruritus
To compare the safety and efficacy of cetirizine with that of hydroxyzine and placebo in the treatment of chronic idiopathic urticaria. A 4-week multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled safety and efficacy study. Patients were treated in a variety of allergy practice settings. The study population consisted of 188 patients who were at least 12 years of age, with symptomatic chronic idiopathic urticaria that had occurred episodically for at least 6 weeks. Patients were given either cetirizine 10 mg once daily, hydroxyzine 25 mg tid, or placebo for 4 weeks. Patients and investigators used a 4-point scale to evaluate symptoms of urticaria and adverse effects of treatment. Ratings were compared among those taking cetirizine, hydroxyzine, or placebo. After 1 day of treatment, patients randomized to receive cetirizine 10 mg/d exhibited a reduction in the number of episodes of urticaria (and a reduction in pruritus) compared with patients who received hydroxyzine 25 mg tid and patients who received placebo (p = 0.002). The number of urticarial episodes in patients treated with hydroxyzine did not reach significance until day 2 (p = 0.001). Compared with patients who received placebo, patients who received cetirizine and those who received hydroxyzine showed reductions during weeks 1, 2, and 3 and at end-point analysis in the number and size of lesions and in the severity of pruritus (p < 0.04). Patient and physician evaluations at the end of week 4 revealed an improvement in urticarial symptoms for the hydroxyzine and cetirizine groups compared with the placebo group (p < 0.001). Four patients in the hydroxyzine group, 1 patient in the cetirizine group, and 1 patient in the placebo group discontinued the study because of sedation. No patient withdrew because of lack of efficacy. Cetirizine 10 mg once daily was equivalent to hydroxyzine 25 mg tid in controlling the symptoms of patients with chronic urticaria, as assessed by patient and investigator evaluations.","In a single double-blind placebo-controlled study of 188 patients at least 12 years of age, they received cetirizine 10 mg daily, hydroxyzine 25 mg 3 times daily, or placebo. This study found both agents produced significant, and equivalent, pruritus reduction relative to placebo."
"What is the target for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in patients with heart disease
Throughout the usual LDL cholesterol range in Western populations, lower blood concentrations are associated with lower cardiovascular disease risk. In such populations, therefore, reducing LDL cholesterol may reduce the development of vascular disease, largely irrespective of initial cholesterol concentrations. 20,536 UK adults (aged 40-80 years) with coronary disease, other occlusive arterial disease, or diabetes were randomly allocated to receive 40 mg simvastatin daily (average compliance: 85%) or matching placebo (average non-study statin use: 17%). Analyses are of the first occurrence of particular events, and compare all simvastatin-allocated versus all placebo-allocated participants. These ""intention-to-treat"" comparisons assess the effects of about two-thirds (85% minus 17%) taking a statin during the scheduled 5-year treatment period, which yielded an average difference in LDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L (about two-thirds of the effect of actual use of 40 mg simvastatin daily). Primary outcomes were mortality (for overall analyses) and fatal or non-fatal vascular events (for subcategory analyses), with subsidiary assessments of cancer and of other major morbidity. All-cause mortality was significantly reduced (1328 [12.9%] deaths among 10,269 allocated simvastatin versus 1507 [14.7%] among 10,267 allocated placebo; p=0.0003), due to a highly significant 18% (SE 5) proportional reduction in the coronary death rate (587 [5.7%] vs 707 [6.9%]; p=0.0005), a marginally significant reduction in other vascular deaths (194 [1.9%] vs 230 [2.2%]; p=0.07), and a non-significant reduction in non-vascular deaths (547 [5.3%] vs 570 [5.6%]; p=0.4). There were highly significant reductions of about one-quarter in the first event rate for non-fatal myocardial infarction or coronary death (898 [8.7%] vs 1212 [11.8%]; p<0.0001), for non-fatal or fatal stroke (444 [4.3%] vs 585 [5.7%]; p<0.0001), and for coronary or non-coronary revascularisation (939 [9.1%] vs 1205 [11.7%]; p<0.0001). For the first occurrence of any of these major vascular events, there was a definite 24% (SE 3; 95% CI 19-28) reduction in the event rate (2033 [19.8%] vs 2585 [25.2%] affected individuals; p<0.0001). During the first year the reduction in major vascular events was not significant, but subsequently it was highly significant during each separate year. The proportional reduction in the event rate was similar (and significant) in each subcategory of participant studied, including: those without diagnosed coronary disease who had cerebrovascular disease, or had peripheral artery disease, or had diabetes; men and, separately, women; those aged either under or over 70 years at entry; and--most notably--even those who presented with LDL cholesterol below 3.0 mmol/L (116 mg/dL), or total cholesterol below 5.0 mmol/L (193 mg/dL). The benefits of simvastatin were additional to those of other cardioprotective treatments. The annual excess risk of myopathy with this regimen was about 0.01%. There were no significant adverse effects on cancer incidence or on hospitalisation for any other non-vascular cause. Adding simvastatin to existing treatments safely produces substantial additional benefits for a wide range of high-risk patients, irrespective of their initial cholesterol concentrations. Allocation to 40 mg simvastatin daily reduced the rates of myocardial infarction, of stroke, and of revascularisation by about one-quarter. After making allowance for non-compliance, actual use of this regimen would probably reduce these rates by about one-third. Hence, among the many types of high-risk individual studied, 5 years of simvastatin would prevent about 70-100 people per 1000 from suffering at least one of these major vascular events (and longer treatment should produce further benefit). The size of the 5-year benefit depends chiefly on such individuals' overall risk of major vascular events, rather than on their blood lipid concentrations alone.","The Heart Protection Study used simvastatin 40 mg daily, without titration. The Heart Protection Study enrolled 20,000 people with CAD or equivalent (diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, stroke, etc). The study demonstrated a reduction of major coronary events with simvastatin, with numbers needed to treat (NNT) of 19 (P <.0001); the NNT for reduction in all-cause mortality was 55 (P =.0003). The benefit of simvastatin was noted in virtually every predefined subgroup, including individuals older than 70 years, women, and patients without known CAD (but with CAD equivalents). Notably, no difference in benefit was found between patients with different pretreatment LDL levels. A significant reduction in major vascular events was noted even for the 3400 subjects with pretreatment LDL levels of less than 100 mg/dL (NNT = 22, P =.0006). A greater percentage reduction in LDL with medication did not predict better clinical outcomes."
"Is the ThinPrep better than conventional Pap smear at detecting cervical cancer
We sought to evaluate the cytologic diagnosis and sample adequacy of the liquid-based cervical cytologic smear (ThinPrep) compared with that of the conventional Papanicolaou smear. Prospective studies of ThinPrep and conventional Papanicolaou smears were analyzed for cytologic diagnosis and sample adequacy. Computerized databases, references in published studies, and index reviews published in English were used to identify direct-to-vial and split-sample clinical trials of cervical smears performed by conventional and liquid-based techniques. Only published studies that used the Bethesda system nomenclature with clearly documented outcome data were included. Each trial was assessed for the quality of its method, inclusion and exclusion criteria, adequacy of randomization, sampling protocols, definition of outcome, and statistical analyses. Twenty-five studies met inclusion criteria for this review. Odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals were calculated for each outcome. Estimates of odds ratios and risk differences for dichotomous outcomes were calculated by use of random and fixed-effects models. Homogeneity was tested across the studies. Results indicate that the ThinPrep test is as good as or superior to the conventional Papanicolaou smear in diagnosing uterine cervical premalignant abnormalities. Also the ThinPrep test provides improved sample adequacy when compared with the conventional Papanicolaou test. The ThinPrep test improved sample adequacy and led to improved diagnosis of low-grade and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions. However, there is no difference in the rate of atypical cells of undetermined significance diagnosis between ThinPrep and conventional smear groups. The added cost of ThinPrep cytologic screening and, hence, its cost-effectiveness are not evaluated in this study.","A large meta-analysis of 25 prospective studies including over 500,000 women reported that ThinPrep increased detection of low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL) (odds ratio [OR]=2.15; 95% CI, 2.05-2.26) and HSIL (OR=2.26; 95% CI, 1.53-1.76), but the conclusions were severely limited by lack of a reference standard and high heterogeneity between study populations."
"Should people with a first-degree relative who died from subarachnoid hemorrhage be screened for aneurysms
The purpose of this study was to establish whether individuals with a family history of >/=2 first-degree relatives with intracranial aneurysm should be offered screening for aneurysm. We derived 3 theoretical models and calculated the outcomes of screening with magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) followed by digital subtraction angiography (DSA) if MRA was positive (model 1), screening with DSA alone (model 2), and not screening (model 3). Screening was repeated at intervals of 10 years, and aneurysms detected were treated surgically. We assumed a prevalence of aneurysm of 9.8% (95% CI, 8.9% to 10.6%) in the population screened, an annual rupture rate of asymptomatic aneurysm of 0.8% (95% CI, 0.4% to 1.5%), and a 75% chance of poor outcome from rupture. We assumed the sensitivity and specificity of MRA were each 90% and the risk of DSA was 0.1%. The risk of surgery was taken as 5.1%. Screening 1000 individuals on 3 occasions with MRA and DSA or with DSA alone followed by surgery resulted in poor outcome in 14 and 18 individuals, respectively, over 30 years. Without screening, poor outcome occurred in 15 individuals over the same period of time. Screening is not an effective way of reducing morbidity and mortality from ruptured intracranial aneurysm in individuals with a history of >/=2 affected first-degree relatives with ruptured intracranial aneurysm unless the expected incidence of asymptomatic aneurysm is considerably >10%.","In a study of MRA with digital subtraction angiography backup, conducted using theoretical models, screening individuals having 2 or more first-degree relatives with aneurysm would result in severe morbidity or death in 26 individuals per 1000 patients screened, vs 15 per 1000 unscreened individuals over a 30-year period. These results were achieved assuming an ICA prevalence estimate of 9.8%, as determined from an earlier population study of individuals with at least 2 first-degree relatives with ICA. The lower ICA prevalence rate of 4% for patients with only 1 primary affected relative would yield an even more favorable result for not screening."
"What are effective medication combinations for dyslipidemia
To develop an optimal treatment strategy that reduces low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels and improves adherence to therapy by reviewing clinical trials that define the dose-response characteristics for 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins), bile acid sequestrants, and niacin. Data were obtained from a MEDLINE search of the English-language literature published from 1975 through November 1995 and from an extensive bibliography review. Controlled, clinical trials were reviewed if they evaluated 1) the effectiveness and toxicity of one LDL cholesterol-lowering agent (statins, bile acid sequestrants, or niacin, at two or more doses) or 2) monotherapy with two LDL cholesterol-lowering agents at defined doses used alone and in combination. Studies that had fewer than 10 patients in a treatment group or that selected patients on the basis of previous response to therapy were not included. Trials were reviewed for overall methodology, inclusion and exclusion criteria, sources of bias, and outcomes. Dose-response relations for bile acid sequestrants and statins are nonlinear, and most of their LDL cholesterol-lowering effects can be obtained with lower doses. The few dose-response studies of niacin that have been done suggest that most of niacin's high-density lipoprotein cholesterol-increasing effect can also be achieved with relatively low doses, but higher doses are needed to substantially reduce LDL cholesterol levels. If bile acid sequestrants or niacin are added to statin therapy, the effect of combined therapy on LDL cholesterol levels is additive. The nonlinear dose-response relation of statins, bile acid sequestrants, and niacin and their additive LDL cholesterol-lowering effect when used together suggest a strategy for treating hypercholesterolemia that may optimize effectiveness while minimizing adverse effects and cost.",A systematic review found that adding colestipol or cholestyramine to a statin provides an additional 7% to 20% absolute LDL cholesterol reduction.
"What are effective medication combinations for dyslipidemia
Precautionary warnings for severe myopathy and rhabdomyolysis from the coadministration of statins and fibrates have been well publicized. However, a recent cerivastatin labeling change made the combined use with fibric acid derivatives a contraindication. Practical recommendations for clinicians who care for patients with refractory mixed hyperlipidemia are needed. To provide recommendations for clinicians in the treatment of refractory mixed hyperlipidemia. A comprehensive MEDLINE (1966-July 2000) and bibliographic search was performed. Thirty-six published clinical trials and 29 case reports involving combination therapy with hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors and fibric acid derivatives regarding the occurrence of rhabdomyolysis or myopathy were reviewed. The literature review demonstrated that combination therapy with a statin and fibrate increases the risk of muscle damage, with an incidence of 0.12%. Risk factors that predispose patients to myopathy caused by combination statin-fibrate therapy include increased age, female gender, renal or liver disease, diabetes, hypothyroidism, debilitated status, surgery, trauma, excessive alcohol intake, and heavy exercise. Combination therapy with a statin and fibrate offers significant therapeutic advantage for the treatment of severe or refractory mixed hyperlipidemia. Although such a combination does increase the risk of myopathy, with an incidence of approximately 0.12%, this small risk of myopathy rarely outweighs the established morbidity and mortality benefits of achieving lipid goals. Nevertheless, a higher incidence of myopathy has been reported with statin monotherapy. When monotherapy with a statin fails to control mixed hyperlipidemia, combination therapy may be considered. Niacin may be added before a fibrate is considered, as it appears to have less risk of myopathy. Statin-fibrate combination therapy must be undertaken cautiously and only after careful risk-benefit analysis. Patient counseling on the risks and warning signs of myopathy is extremely important.","In an analysis of 36 controlled clinical trials (1674 patients) that evaluated statin-fibrate combinations, 0.12% of patients developed myopathy, but none developed rhabdomyolysis or kidney failure."
"How effective are lifestyle changes for controlling hypertension
Alcohol drinking has been associated with increased blood pressure in epidemiological studies. We conducted a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to assess the effects of alcohol reduction on blood pressure. We included 15 randomized control trials (total of 2234 participants) published before June 1999 in which alcohol reduction was the only intervention difference between active and control treatment groups. Using a standard protocol, information on sample size, participant characteristics, study design, intervention methods, duration, and treatment results was abstracted independently by 3 investigators. By means of a fixed-effects model, findings from individual trials were pooled after results for each trial were weighted by the inverse of its variance. Overall, alcohol reduction was associated with a significant reduction in mean (95% confidence interval) systolic and diastolic blood pressures of -3.31 mm Hg (-2.52 to -4.10 mm Hg) and -2.04 mm Hg (-1.49 to -2.58 mm Hg), respectively. A dose-response relationship was observed between mean percentage of alcohol reduction and mean blood pressure reduction. Effects of intervention were enhanced in those with higher baseline blood pressure. Our study suggests that alcohol reduction should be recommended as an important component of lifestyle modification for the prevention and treatment of hypertension among heavy drinkers.","A well-done meta-analysis of alcohol reduction and blood pressure included 7 studies with 415 hypertensive patients. Mean baseline alcohol consumption was 3 to 6 alcoholic drinks per day, and the mean reduction in consumption was 67%. For this patient population, the average improvement was almost 4 mm Hg for SBP and nearly 2.5 mm Hg for DBP."
"How effective are lifestyle changes for controlling hypertension
It is known that obesity, sodium intake, and alcohol consumption factors influence blood pressure. In this clinical trial, Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension, we assessed the effects of dietary patterns on blood pressure. We enrolled 459 adults with systolic blood pressures of less than 160 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressures of 80 to 95 mm Hg. For three weeks, the subjects were fed a control diet that was low in fruits, vegetables, and dairy products, with a fat content typical of the average diet in the United States. They were then randomly assigned to receive for eight weeks the control diet, a diet rich in fruits and vegetables, or a ""combination"" diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy products and with reduced saturated and total fat. Sodium intake and body weight were maintained at constant levels. At base line, the mean (+/-SD) systolic and diastolic blood pressures were 131.3+/-10.8 mm Hg and 84.7+/-4.7 mm Hg, respectively. The combination diet reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressure by 5.5 and 3.0 mm Hg more, respectively, than the control diet (P<0.001 for each); the fruits-and-vegetables diet reduced systolic blood pressure by 2.8 mm Hg more (P<0.001) and diastolic blood pressure by 1.1 mm Hg more than the control diet (P=0.07). Among the 133 subjects with hypertension (systolic pressure, > or =140 mm Hg; diastolic pressure, > or =90 mm Hg; or both), the combination diet reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressure by 11.4 and 5.5 mm Hg more, respectively, than the control diet (P<0.001 for each); among the 326 subjects without hypertension, the corresponding reductions were 3.5 mm Hg (P<0.001) and 2.1 mm Hg (P=0.003). A diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy foods and with reduced saturated and total fat can substantially lower blood pressure. This diet offers an additional nutritional approach to preventing and treating hypertension.","In a high-quality RCT, the DASH diet lowered SBP for hypertensive patients by an average of 11 mm Hg and DBP by an average of 5.5 mm Hg compared with the control group. Participants were provided with all food during the entire 8-week length of the trial."
"What precautions should we use with statins for women of childbearing age
In this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study, normally cycling women (n = 86) with elevated low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels were studied over six menstrual cycles. At the end of the screening phase, participants received placebo for the second menstrual cycle and subsequently were randomized to receive either placebo or simvastatin (40 mg/d) for the next four cycles. The second and sixth menstrual cycles were considered baseline and treatment cycles, respectively. Participants kept a menstrual diary throughout the study and provided daily first-void urine samples during cycles 2 and 6. Urine samples were assayed for LH and pregnanediol glucuronide (PdG). The primary end point was change in luteal phase duration as defined by the day of the urinary LH peak to the day preceding the onset of menstruation. Treatment with simvastatin (40 mg/d) effectively lowered LDL-C by 34.3% (P < 0.001). Simvastatin was generally well tolerated, and no meaningful difference in adverse event profile was observed between treatment groups. Compared with the placebo group, simvastatin did not have clinically relevant effects on luteal phase duration, peak PdG concentration, or integrated luteal phase PdG concentration. The results of this study demonstrate that treatment of healthy premenopausal women for approximately 4 months with simvastatin (40 mg/d) lowers LDL-C without adversely affecting reproductive gonadal function. Simvastatin should not be used during pregnancy or by nursing mothers.","One study suggests that short-term use of simvastatin does not affect menstruation or ovulation of premenopausal women. This double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial enrolled 86 normally cycling women. Mean age of women completing the study was 35. Simvastatin 40 mg/d was studied for cholesterol effects and female reproductive effects. Urinary luteinizing hormone (LH) and pregnanediol glucuronide (PDG), a progesterone metabolite, were assessed to determine if treatment with simvastatin adversely affects luteal function. Simvastatin lowered low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by 34.3% (P<.001). Normal luteal phase duration and peak were confirmed by urinary PDG and LH levels. This study demonstrated that treatment with simvastatin for 4 months had no significant clinical changes on reproductive gonadal function compared with placebo."
"When should we screen children for hyperlipidemia
In the majority of people with familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) the disorder is caused by a mutation of the low-density lipoprotein receptor gene that impairs its proper function, resulting in very high levels of plasma cholesterol. Such levels result in early and severe atherosclerosis, and hence substantial excess mortality from coronary heart disease. Most people with FH are undiagnosed or only diagnosed after their first coronary event, but early detection and treatment with hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme (HMG CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) can reduce morbidity and mortality. The prevalence of FH in the UK population is estimated to be 1 in 500, which means that approximately 110,000 people are affected. To evaluate whether screening for FH is appropriate. To determine which system of screening is most acceptable and cost-effective. To assess the deleterious psychosocial effects of genetic and clinical screening for an asymptomatic treatable inherited condition. To assess whether the risks of screening outweigh potential benefits.  Relevant papers were identified through a search of the electronic databases. Additional papers referenced in the search material were identified and collected. Known researchers in the field were contacted and asked to supply information on unpublished or ongoing studies. INCLUSION/EXCLUSION CRITERIA: SCREENING AND TREATMENT: The review included studies of the mortality and morbidity associated with FH, the effectiveness and cost of treatment (ignoring pre-statin therapies in adults), and of the effectiveness or cost of possible screening strategies for FH. PSYCHOSOCIAL EFFECTS OF SCREENING: The search for papers on the psychological and social effects of screening for a treatable inherited condition was limited to the last 5 years because recent developments in genetic testing have changed the nature and implications of such screening tests. Papers focusing on genetic testing for FH and breast cancer were included. Papers relating to the risk of coronary heart disease with similarly modifiable outcome (non-FH) were also included. DATA EXTRACTION AND ASSESSMENT OF VALIDITY: A data assessment tool was designed to assess the quality and validity of the papers which reported primary data for the social and psychological effects of screening. Available guidelines for systematically reviewing papers concentrated on quantitative methods, and were of limited relevance. An algorithm was developed which could be used for both the qualitative and quantitative literature. MODELLING METHODS: A model was constructed to investigate the relative cost and effectiveness of various forms of population screening (universal or opportunistic) and case-finding screening (screening relatives of known FH cases). All strategies involved a two-stage process: first, identifying those people with cholesterol levels sufficiently elevated to be compatible with a diagnosis of FH, and then either making the diagnosis based on clinical signs and a family history of coronary disease or carrying out genetic tests. Cost-effectiveness has been measured in terms of incremental cost per year of life gained. MODELLING COST-EFFECTIVENESS: FH is a life-threatening condition with a long presymptomatic state. Diagnostic tests are reasonably reliable and acceptable, and treatment with statins substantially improves prognosis. Therefore, it is appropriate to consider systematic screening for this condition. Case finding amongst relatives of FH cases was the most cost-effective strategy, and universal systematic screening the least cost-effective. However, when targeted at young people (16 year olds) universal screening was also cost-effective. Screening patients admitted to hospital with premature myocardial infarction was also relatively cost-effective. Screening is least cost-effective in men aged over 35 years, because the gains in life expectancy are small. (ABSTRACT TRUNCA","One systematic review and cost-effectiveness analysis investigated the appropriateness and cost-effectiveness of screening methods for familial hypercholesterolemia beginning at the age of 16 years. The authors identified potential screening strategies from 6 cross-sectional studies and applied these to a decision analysis. Screening of first-degree relatives of those with familial hypercholesterolemia was most effective in detecting cases of familial hypercholesterolemia (number needed to screen [NNS]=3; cost per case detected=$232; cost per life-year gained=$5397). Universal screening of all 16-year-olds was also cost-effective (cost per life-year gained=$4839), but resulted in a much larger NNS and cost of detection (NNS=1365, cost per case detected=$16,999). The authors concluded that case finding through screening of first-degree relatives was the most cost-effective strategy overall."
"When should we screen children for hyperlipidemia
The family basis of coronary heart disease is well recognized and it is important for family physicians to assess whether children have elevated cholesterol levels. We aimed to evaluate the advisability of implementing cholesterol screening in children with a family history of cardiovascular disease and hyperlipidaemia. We conducted a cross-sectional study in Taiwan from February to June 1996. There were 47,800 students in the population. A total of 4520 students were recruited by two-stage sampling. All the participants were required to fill out a structured questionnaire. The response rate was 92.5%. Our results show that 16-18% of the children had a positive family history of cardiovascular disease or hyperlipidaemia. Children with a family history of hyperlipidaemia were significantly more likely to have elevated total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol than those without such a history (both odds ratios: 1.4, P < 0.05). Positive predictive values of hyperlipidaemia were less than 13% based on family history. More than 75% of children with abnormal lipid levels would be missed. The data suggest that parents' self-reported family history is an ineffective means of identifying children with elevated serum lipid levels in Taiwan. Further research and modification of current National Cholesterol Education Program Panel guidelines for selective cholesterol screening in children may be warranted.","A study used a cross-sectional design to evaluate family history of premature cardiovascular disease and hyperlipidemia screening indicators in 4183 grade-school children in Taiwan. Family history performed poorly as a mechanism for identifying children with hypercholesterolemia (total cholesterol >200 mg/dL; LDL >130 mg/dL) (PPV <12.5%7). More than 75% of the children in the Taiwan study would have been missed using family history as a screen. Study concluded that family history as a screening indicator is insensitive and inaccurate, and no more useful than general population screening."
"When should we screen children for hyperlipidemia
To determine the usefulness of parent history of hypercholesterolemia and cardiovascular disease as a screening criterion for hypercholesterolemia in youths. Data were available from a population-based survey of 3665 Quebec youths aged 9, 13, and 16 years (81.2% of eligible subjects). Blood specimens were collected from 2475 subjects (54.8% of those eligible), and questionnaire data were obtained from 3048 parents (67.5% of those eligible). Lipids were measured in a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention standardized laboratory. Usefulness of parent history in identifying borderline/high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (> or =2.8 mmol/L [> or =110 mg/dL]) and high LDL-C (> or =3.4 mmol/L [> or =130 mg/dL]) was assessed according to test performance statistics (sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value). The prevalence of a positive parent history was 25.6%; 18.3% of subjects had borderline/high LDL-C, and 4.8% had high LDL-C. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of parent history were 33.1%, 76.0%, 23.7%, and 83.5%, respectively, for identifying borderline/high LDL-C; they were 40.7%, 75.1%, 7.7%, and 96.1% for identifying high LDL-C. Test performance statistics were not improved in subgroups defined according to age, gender, parent education, household income, family status, and family origin (French Canadian, other); neither were they improved by adding screening criteria (parent history of diabetes or hypertension, or youth overweight). Parent history screening criteria offer little improvement over random population screening in identifying youths with hypercholesterolemia.","A study used a cross-sectional design to evaluate family history of premature cardiovascular disease and hyperlipidemia screening indicators 2217 youths in Quebec.

"What are contraindications to IUDs
The influence of different contraceptive techniques on the incidence of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) in 672 patients with gonorrhoea have been studied. The lowest frequency of PID was found in patients using hormonal contraceptives (Group A), 8.8 per cent compared to 23.5 per cent in patients using intrauterine devices (Group B) and 15.1 per cent in patients using neither technique (Group C). In comparable control groups no significant differences in background factors, such as age, marital status and sexual activity were demonstrated. It is therefore concluded that the significantly lower incidence of PID in patients using hormonal contraceptives compared to the other groups and the high incidence of PID in patients using intrauterine devices is related to the contraceptive technique per se.",IUD insertion does not increase the risk of PID for women with gonorrhea or chlamydia infection compared with infected nonusers.
"Which infants need lumbar puncture for suspected sepsis
A prospective study was undertaken to evaluate the usefulness of low risk criteria for identifying febrile neonates unlikely to have bacterial infections, particularly bacteremia and meningitis. Using these criteria we wished to check whether these low risk neonates can be safely managed as inpatients under close observation but without receiving empiric antibiotic therapy. We conducted a prospective study of 250 consecutive infants 28 days of age or less (range, 4 to 28 days) who had rectal temperatures of at least 38 degrees C. After a complete history, physical examination and sepsis workup, the 131 febrile neonates with clinical and laboratory findings indicating low risk for bacterial infections were hospitalized, closely observed and not given antibiotics. The low risk criteria used to identify these neonates included well appearance; absence of physical signs of an ear, eye or soft tissue infection; a white blood cell count of 5000 to 15,000/mm3, a neutrophil band form count of < 1500/mm3, a spun urine specimen that had < 10 white blood cells per high power field on microscopy and a C-reactive protein value of < 20 mg/l. The remaining 119 febrile neonates who did not meet the low risk criteria were hospitalized and given empiric antibiotics pending culture results. The overall incidence of bacterial infections in the 250 febrile neonates was 16.4% (41 neonates) with bacteremia and/or meningitis occurring in 4.4% (11 neonates). Of the 131 low risk neonates only one (0.8%) had a bacterial infection (urinary tract infection) compared with 40 (33.6%) among the 119 who did not meet the criteria (P < 0.05). The negative predictive value of these criteria for excluding bacterial infections was 99.2% (95% confidence interval, 97.7% to 100%). For bacteremia and meningitis this figure became 100%. However, the positive predictive value and specificity of the criteria were too low to identify all febrile neonates with bacterial infections. Among the low risk group 58 (44.3%) were reclassified on the second or third hospital day, because of continued fever (35), poor activity (14) and white blood cell count > 15000/mm3 on a repeat blood test (9). They were given antibiotics, but only 1 had a urinary tract infection. This patient was then treated with a 7-day course of antibiotics. All low risk neonates recovered uneventfully with no relapses observed during their hospital stay or at the time of minimum 1-week outpatient follow-up visits. By the low risk criteria a substantial number of febrile neonates at low risk for bacterial infections can be identified and managed safely as inpatients without antibiotic therapy.","One prospective cohort study of infants aged <1 month hospitalized for fever used a similar method for assessing risk, but added a C-reactive protein value <20 mg/L to criteria for low-risk. Of 250 infants studied, 131 (52%) were low-risk; none of these developed bacterial meningitis."
"Does a knee brace decrease recurrent ACL injuries
To compare the functional performance of subjects with unilateral anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. Cross-sectional comparative clinical trial. A physical therapy outpatient department. Thirty-one subjects with unilateral ACL reconstruction for more than 5 months. Patients under 3 bracing conditions: (1) DonJoy Brace, (2) mechanical placebo brace, or (3) no brace. Running and turning 10 times on a 22-meter figure-8 runway, and running and jumping (and landing) on a semicircular path. Speed of running and turning, speed of running and jumping, and accuracy of landing after the jump. Subjects performed similarly in conditions 1 and 2 in all the tests, but the speeds of running and turning were significantly slower in conditions 1 and 2 than condition 3 (p =.008--.000). Results of the run and jump tests were not different among all conditions. Knee bracing may not improve functional performance of subjects 5 months after ACL reconstruction. The use of such a brace could actually slow down running and turning, irrespective of the mechanical constraints of the brace. These functional outcomes need to be noted when such a brace is used on this group of subjects.","One study evaluated running, jumping, and turning performance with and without a functional brace in 31 patients who had had an ACL reconstruction 5 to 26 months previously. They measured significantly better performance without bracing; however, more than half the group perceived enhanced performance with the brace."
"What medication best prevents migraine in children
In a prospective study we compared propranolol, placebo, and self-hypnosis in the treatment of juvenile classic migraine. Children aged 6 to 12 years with classic migraine who had no previous specific treatment were randomized into propranolol (at 3 mg/kg/d) or placebo groups for a 3-month period and then crossed over for 3 months. After this 6-month period, each child was taught self-hypnosis and used it for 3 months. Twenty-eight patients completed the entire study. The mean number of headaches per child for 3 months during the placebo period was 13.3 compared with 14.9 during the propranolol period and 5.8 during the self-hypnosis period. Statistical analysis showed a significant association between decrease in headache frequency and self-hypnosis training (P = .045). There was no significant change in subjective or objective measures of headache severity with either therapy.","A comparative randomized controlled trial with multiple crossovers involving 33 children found that a self-hypnosis placebo decreased mean headache frequency from 13.3 per 3-month interval to 5.8 (P=.045), but found propranolol no different than placebo. Propranolol was also studied in a 3-armed randomized controlled trial in comparison with flunarizine-a drug likely to be efficacious-and placebo."
"What medication best prevents migraine in children
To study the effectiveness of a standardized dose of amitriptyline, 1 mg/kg, for childhood headaches. Amitriptyline has been shown to be effective for the prophylaxis of migraine in adults. Studies in children, however, have been quite limited. In adults, the suggested effective dose range is 10 to 150 mg. In children, a standardized dosage is often not used, resulting in a dosage range in clinical practice that often varies from a very low dose to a dose equivalent to that used in adults. Children with more than three headaches per month were treated with amitriptyline, slowly increasing the dose to 1 mg/kg per day. The frequency, severity, and duration of their headaches were initially evaluated and subsequently measured at each follow-up evaluation. Two hundred seventy-nine children had headaches occurring frequently enough to indicate prophylactic treatment. Of these children, 192 (68.8%) were treated with amitriptyline. The average age at presentation was 12.0 (+/- 3.0) years. The ratio of boys to girls was 1:1.74. The average frequency of headaches was 17.1 (+/- 10.1) days per month. The average severity was 6.84 (+/- 1.67) on a 10-point pain scale. The average duration was 11.5 (+/- 15.0) hours. The most frequent diagnoses using International Headache Society criteria were migraine (60.6%), migraine with aura (7.9%), and tension-type headache (10.4%). Of these children, 146 have been seen for at least one follow-up examination, occurring on average 67.3 (+/- 32.3) days after beginning prophylactic treatment. A total of 84.2% of the children reported an overall perception of being better, while 11.6% reported being the same. The frequency of headaches improved to 9.2 (+/- 10.0) days per month. The average severity was reduced to 5.1 (+/- 2.1), and the average duration was reduced to 6.3 (+/- 11.1) hours. If daily or continuous headaches were excluded, the improvements were more marked. Minimal side effects were reported from these children and their families. Long-term evaluation (156 to 415 days) showed continued sustained improvement. Amitriptyline is an effective prophylactic medication for children with frequent headaches. A standardized dosing regimen results in a significant number of children responding with minimal side effects. The children are able to tolerate this dosing scheme and demonstrate good adherence to a dosing schedule of once a day.","A prospective cohort trial studied 192 children. Of the 146 patients available for the first follow-up visit, 84% noted subjective improvement of symptoms. Headache frequency decreased from 17.1 ± 10.1 to 9.2 ± 10.0 days/month (P<.001)."
"What medication best prevents migraine in children
Migraine according to the criteria of the International Headache Society, occurs in about 3 to 7% of all children. Despite this high incidence, and unlike the situation with adult migraine, only a very few controlled trials have investigated the acute and prophylactic treatment of migraine in children. In the acute migraine attack, ibuprofen 10 mg/kg and paracetamol (acetaminophen) 15 mg/kg have been shown to be effective, with only a few adverse effects. In severe migraine attacks, dihydroergotamine mesylate (dihydroergotamine) administered orally (20 to 40 microg/kg) or intravenously (maximum 1 mg/day) may be helpful, but there have been no large placebo-controlled trials of this treatment. Oral sumatriptan has not been effective in several double-blind and placebo-controlled trials; administered subcutaneously, this drug might be helpful but the only data for this application come from open trials. For migraine prophylaxis, only flunarizine 5 mg/day has been shown to be effective in more than 1 double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Some evidence also exists that propranolol >60 mg/day and pizotifen 0.5 to 1.5 mg/day are effective; however, the results from different trials are contradictory. For all other drugs studied in migraine prophylaxis, the results remain vague (e.g. amitriptyline, nimodipine, trazodone) or suggest inefficacy (e.g. timolol, clonidine, tryptophan). In migraine-related disorders, pizotifen 0.5 to 0.75 mg/day for abdominal migraine and flunarizine 10 to 25 mg/day for alternating hemiplegia have been shown to be effective. Most of the drugs used in the treatment of migraine in children are well tolerated and without relevant adverse effects. In migraine prophylaxis, the most common adverse effects are drowsiness and bodyweight gain.","Flunarizine was found to be effective in multiple well-designed randomized controlled trials and case series, as well as in multiple comparative trials with other agents."
"What medication best prevents migraine in children
An 8-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial of flunarizine in the prophylaxis of migraine has been performed in 70 children. After 4 weeks of medication-free base-line observation, 35 children (group A) received flunarizine (5 mg/day) and 35 (group B) received placebo over a 12-week period. After a 4-week washout they crossed treatments for another 12 weeks. Sixty-three patients completed the trial. In both groups flunarizine significantly reduced the frequency and average duration of headache attacks. In group A efficacy was maintained after placebo crossover for the last 4 months of the study. Five subjects in group B stopped placebo because of ineffectiveness; two children in group A discontinued flunarizine treatment, one because of excessive daytime sedation and the other because therapy was ineffective. The main side effects were daytime sedation and weight gain. It is concluded that flunarizine is an effective drug for the treatment of childhood migraine. In a study of this length no serious side effects were discovered.",A randomized controlled trial in 70 children flunarizine decreased mean headache frequency.
"In patients with a previous CVA, do antioxidants protect against subsequent stroke
It has been suggested that increased intake of various antioxidant vitamins reduces the incidence rates of vascular disease, cancer, and other adverse outcomes. 20,536 UK adults (aged 40-80) with coronary disease, other occlusive arterial disease, or diabetes were randomly allocated to receive antioxidant vitamin supplementation (600 mg vitamin E, 250 mg vitamin C, and 20 mg beta-carotene daily) or matching placebo. Intention-to-treat comparisons of outcome were conducted between all vitamin-allocated and all placebo-allocated participants. An average of 83% of participants in each treatment group remained compliant during the scheduled 5-year treatment period. Allocation to this vitamin regimen approximately doubled the plasma concentration of alpha-tocopherol, increased that of vitamin C by one-third, and quadrupled that of beta-carotene. Primary outcomes were major coronary events (for overall analyses) and fatal or non-fatal vascular events (for subcategory analyses), with subsidiary assessments of cancer and of other major morbidity. There were no significant differences in all-cause mortality (1446 [14.1%] vitamin-allocated vs 1389 [13.5%] placebo-allocated), or in deaths due to vascular (878 [8.6%] vs 840 [8.2%]) or non-vascular (568 [5.5%] vs 549 [5.3%]) causes. Nor were there any significant differences in the numbers of participants having non-fatal myocardial infarction or coronary death (1063 [10.4%] vs 1047 [10.2%]), non-fatal or fatal stroke (511 [5.0%] vs 518 [5.0%]), or coronary or non-coronary revascularisation (1058 [10.3%] vs 1086 [10.6%]). For the first occurrence of any of these ""major vascular events"", there were no material differences either overall (2306 [22.5%] vs 2312 [22.5%]; event rate ratio 1.00 [95% CI 0.94-1.06]) or in any of the various subcategories considered. There were no significant effects on cancer incidence or on hospitalisation for any other non-vascular cause. Among the high-risk individuals that were studied, these antioxidant vitamins appeared to be safe. But, although this regimen increased blood vitamin concentrations substantially, it did not produce any significant reductions in the 5-year mortality from, or incidence of, any type of vascular disease, cancer, or other major outcome.","In the Heart Protection Study, 20,536 adults between the ages of 40 and 80 years with cardiovascular disease, stroke, or diabetes were given vitamin E, vitamin C, beta-carotene, or placebo for 5 years. No significant differences were noted between vitamins and placebo in fatal or nonfatal stroke (RR = 0.99; 95% CI, 0.87-1.12)."
"In patients with a previous CVA, do antioxidants protect against subsequent stroke
High serum or dietary levels of vitamin E and beta carotene appear to be associated with lower risk of stroke, but studies regarding their supplementation have not supported their use in stroke prevention. To determine if vitamin E (dl-alpha tocopherol) and beta carotene supplementations could be used in prevention of stroke in men at high risk for hemorrhagic or ischemic events. Population-based, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2 x 2 factorial design trial (the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention Study), conducted from April 1985 through April 30, 1993, with median follow-up of 6 years. Alpha tocopherol, 50 mg; beta carotene, 20 mg; both; or placebo. From the total male population aged 50 through 69 years in southwestern Finland (n = 290,406), 29,133 male smokers were randomized to 1 of 4 treatment regimens. We excluded 614 men because of previous stroke at baseline, leaving 28, 519. Incident and fatal subarachnoid and intracerebral hemorrhage, cerebral infarction, and unspecified stroke. Stroke occurred in a total of 1057 men: 85 had subarachnoid and 112 had intracerebral hemorrhage, 807 had cerebral infarction, and 53 had unspecified stroke. Within 90 days from onset, 160 men died of stroke. Vitamin E supplementation increased the risk of subarachnoid hemorrhage (relative risk [RR], 2.45; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.08-5.55) and decreased risk of cerebral infarction (RR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.55-0.89) in hypertensive men but had no effect among normotensive men. Furthermore, it decreased the risk of cerebral infarction, without elevating the risk of subarachnoid hemorrhage, among hypertensive men with concurrent diabetes (RR, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.14-0.78). Beta carotene supplementation appeared to increase the risk of intracerebral hemorrhage and modestly decrease that of cerebral infarction among men with greater alcohol consumption. Vitamin E supplementation may prevent ischemic stroke in high-risk hypertensive patients, but further studies are needed. Arch Neurol. 2000;57:1503-1509","Subgroup analysis showed a significant decrease in cerebral infarction (RR = 0.33; 95% CI, 0.14-0.78) without increasing subarachnoid hemorrhage in hypertensive, diabetic men taking vitamin E."
"What interventions can help patients stop using chewing tobacco
There were two experiments on abstinence from smokeless tobacco. The purpose of the first experiment was to determine abstinence effects from smokeless tobacco. The purpose of the second experiment was to examine the effects of different doses of nicotine gum on smokeless tobacco abstinence effects. The subjects were male Copenhagen smokeless tobacco users who underwent 3 days of baseline measurement while continuing to use smokeless tobacco ad libitum, and 5 days of the experimental condition. In the first experiment, the subjects were assigned randomly to one of two groups and compared: continuous smokeless tobacco users (n = 10), and deprivation plus no nicotine gum (n = 10). In the second experiment, subjects were assigned randomly and in a double-blind fashion to one of three groups and compared: (1) deprivation plus 0 mg nicotine gum (n = 20); (2) deprivation plus 2 mg nicotine gum (n = 20); and (3) deprivation plus 4 mg nicotine gum (n = 20). The first experiment showed significant increases upon abstinence for the following variables: (1) craving; (2) difficulty concentrating; (3) restlessness; (4) excessive hunger; (5) eating; (6) reaction time; (7) variability of reaction time and (8) total withdrawal scores for both the self-rated and the observer-rated forms. The second experiment showed that nicotine gum failed to significantly reduce smokeless tobacco abstinence effects, although those with high cotinine levels may receive some benefit from nicotine gum.","A small double-blind study randomized 79 male smokeless tobacco users to chew nicotine gum (0 mg, 2 mg, or 4 mg) for 5 days. Sixty patients completed the study. No significant differences in withdrawal symptoms, including cravings, concentration, or restlessness, were noted among the 3 groups (P>.05). However, further analysis demonstrated that patients with high blood levels of cotinine who received nicotine gum 2 mg experienced decreased cravings compared with placebo (P<.001), and a trend towards decreased cravings with 4 mg gum was noted (P<.06). Limitations of this study: quit rates were not reported, participants did not have to be motivated to quit smokeless tobacco in order to enroll, and it is not known if patients were counseled about the appropriate ""chew and park"" technique for nicotine gum."
"Do antioxidants vitamins C, E improve outcomes in patients with coronary artery disease
Epidemiological data suggest that the intake of antioxidants such as alpha-tocopherol (vitamin E) and beta-carotene has an inverse correlation with the incidence of coronary heart disease. The results from clinical trials of antioxidant supplementation in people with known coronary heart disease are inconclusive. We studied the frequency of major coronary events in 1862 men enrolled in the alpha-tocopherol beta-carotene Cancer Prevention Study (smokers aged between 50 and 69 years) who had a previous myocardial infarction. In this randomised, double-blind. placebo-controlled study, men had received dietary supplements of alpha-tocopherol (50 mg/day), beta-carotene (20 mg/day), both, or placebo. The median follow-up was 5.3 years. The endpoint of this substudy was the first major coronary event after randomisation. Analyses were by intention to treat. 424 major coronary events (non-fatal myocardial infarction and fatal coronary heart disease) occurred during follow-up. There were no significant differences in the number of major coronary events between any supplementation group and the placebo group (alpha-tocopherol 94/466; beta-carotene 113/461; alpha-tocopherol and beta-carotene 123/497; placebo 94/438 [log-rank test, p = 0.25]). There were significantly more deaths from fatal coronary heart disease in the beta-carotene (74/461, multivariate-adjusted relative risk 1.75 [95% CI 1.16-2.64], p = 0.007) and combined alpha-tocopherol and beta-carotene groups (67/497, relative risk 1.58 [1.05-2.40], p = 0.03) than in the placebo group (39/438), but there was no significant increase in the alpha-tocopherol supplementation group (54/466, relative risk 1.33 [0.86-2.05], p = 0.20). The proportion of major coronary events in men with a previous myocardial infarction who smoke was not decreased with either alpha-tocopherol or beta-carotene supplements. In fact, the risk of fatal coronary heart disease increased in the groups that received either beta-carotene or the combination of alpha-tocopherol and beta-carotene; there was a non-significant trend of increased deaths in the alpha-tocopherol group. We do not recommend the use of alpha-tocopherol or beta-carotene supplements in this group of patients.","One double-blind, placebo-controlled RCT demonstrated no change in all-cause mortality or incidence of total cardiovascular events. In a subgroup analysis of this study, 1862 men with history of MI also had reduced risk of non-fatal MI (RR, 0.23)."
"Do antioxidants vitamins C, E improve outcomes in patients with coronary artery disease
Both lipid-modifying therapy and antioxidant vitamins are thought to have benefit in patients with coronary disease. We studied simvastatin-niacin and antioxidant-vitamin therapy, alone and together, for cardiovascular protection in patients with coronary disease and low plasma levels of HDL. In a three-year, double-blind trial, 160 patients with coronary disease, low HDL cholesterol levels and normal LDL cholesterol levels were randomly assigned to receive one of four regimens: simvastatin plus niacin, vitamins, simvastatin-niacin plus antioxidants; or placebos. The end points were arteriographic evidence of a change in coronary stenosis and the occurrence of a first cardiovascular event (death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or revascularization). The mean levels of LDL and HDL cholesterol were unaltered in the antioxidant group and the placebo group; these levels changed substantially (by -42 percent and +26 percent, respectively) in the simvastatin-niacin group. The protective increase in HDL2 with simvastatin plus niacin was attenuated by concurrent therapy with antioxidants. The average stenosis progressed by 3.9 percent with placebos, 1.8 percent with antioxidants (P=0.16 for the comparison with the placebo group), and 0.7 percent with simvastatin-niacin plus antioxidants (P=0.004) and regressed by 0.4 percent with simvastatin-niacin alone (P<0.001). The frequency of the clinical end point was 24 percent with placebos; 3 percent with simvastatin-niacin alone; 21 percent in the antioxidant-therapy group; and 14 percent in the simvastatin-niacin-plus-antioxidants group. Simvastatin plus niacin provides marked clinical and angiographically measurable benefits in patients with coronary disease and low HDL levels. The use of antioxidant vitamins in this setting must be questioned.","A study suggests a negative interaction between simvastatin plus niacin and antioxidant supplementation (composed of vitamins E and C, beta-carotene, and selenium)."

"Which oral antifungal is best for toenail onychomycosis
Effective treatments for onychomycosis are expensive. Previous studies suggest that less costly, pulsed doses of antifungal medications may be as effective as standard, continuous doses. Terbinafine is the current treatment of choice for toenail onychomycosis. Our purpose was to determine whether pulse-dose terbinafine is as effective as standard continuous-dose terbinafine for treatment of toenail onychomycosis. We conducted a double-blind, randomized, noninferiority, clinical intervention trial in the Minneapolis Veterans Affairs Medical Center. The main inclusion criteria for participants were a positive dermatophyte culture and at least 25% distal subungual clinical involvement. Six hundred eighteen volunteers were screened; 306 were randomized. Terbinafine, 250 mg daily for 3 months (continuous) or terbinafine, 500 mg daily for 1 week per month for 3 months (pulse) was administered. The primary outcome measure was mycological cure of the target toenail at 18 months. Secondary outcome measures included clinical cure and complete (clinical plus mycological) cure of the target toenail and complete cure of all 10 toenails. Results of an intent-to-treat analysis did not meet the prespecified criterion for noninferiority but did demonstrate the superiority of continuous-dose terbinafine for: mycological cure of the target toenail (70.9% [105/148] vs 58.7% [84/143]; P =.03, relative risk [RR] of 1.21 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.02-1.43]); clinical cure of the target toenail (44.6% [66/148] vs 29.3% [42/143]; P =.007, RR =1.52 [95% CI, 1.11-2.07); complete cure of the target toenail (40.5% [60/148] vs 28.0% [40/143]; P =.02, RR=1.45 [95% CI, 1.04-2.01); and complete cure of all 10 toenails (25.2% [36/143] vs 14.7% [21/143]; P =.03, RR =1.71 [95% CI, 1.05-2.79). Tolerability of the regimens did not differ significantly between the groups (chi2 =1.63; P =.65). The study population primarily consisted of older men with severe onychomycosis. This study demonstrated the superiority of continuous- over pulse-dose terbinafine. We also found this expensive therapy to be much less effective than previously believed, particularly for achieving complete cure of all 10 toenails.","A randomized, double-blind, controlled trial compared daily terbinafine with pulse-dose terbinafine. Daily terbinafine (250 mg for 3 months) had a 70.9% mycologic cure, while pulse-dose terbinafine (500 mg daily for 1 week per month for 3 months) had only a 58.7% mycologic cure (relative risk [RR]=1.21 [95% CI, 1.02-1.43]; NNT=8.2).

"Which oral antifungal is best for toenail onychomycosis
To examine long-term cure and relapse rates after treatment with continuous terbinafine and intermittent itraconazole in onychomycosis. Long-term prospective follow-up study. Three centers in Iceland. The study population comprised 151 patients aged 18 to 75 years with a clinical and mycological diagnosis of dermatophyte toenail onychomycosis. In a double-blind, double-dummy study, patients were randomized to receive either terbinafine (250 mg/d) for 12 or 16 weeks or itraconazole (400 mg/d) for 1 week in every 4 for 12 or 16 weeks (first intervention). Patients who did not achieve clinical cure at month 18 or experienced relapse or reinfection were offered an additional course of terbinafine (second intervention). The primary efficacy criterion was mycological cure, defined as negative results on microscopy and culture at the end of follow-up and no requirement of second intervention treatment. Secondary efficacy criteria included clinical cure without second intervention treatment and mycological and clinical relapse rates. Median duration of follow-up was 54 months. At the end of the study, mycological cure without second intervention treatment was found in 34 (46%) of the 74 terbinafine-treated subjects and 10 (13%) of the 77 itraconazole-treated subjects (P<.001). Mycological and clinical relapse rates were significantly higher in itraconazole vs terbinafine-treated patients (53% vs 23% and 48% vs 21%, respectively). Of the 72 patients who received subsequent terbinafine treatment, 63 (88%) achieved mycological cure and 55 (76%) achieved clinical cure. In the treatment of onychomycosis, continuous terbinafine provided superior long-term mycological and clinical efficacy and lower rates of mycological and clinical relapse compared with intermittent itraconazole.",A 5-year blinded prospective study found long-term mycologic cures of 46% for terbinafine vs 13% for itraconazole (number needed to treat [NNT]=4.3).

"Do ACE inhibitors prevent nephropathy in type 2 diabetes without proteinuria
Renal disease in people with insulin-dependent diabetes (IDDM) continues to pose a major health threat. Inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) slow the decline of renal function in advanced renal disease, but their effects at earlier stages are unclear, and the degree of albuminuria at which treatment should start is not known. We carried out a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of the ACE inhibitor lisinopril in 530 men and women with IDDM aged 20-59 years with normoalbuminuria or microalbuminuria. Patients were recruited from 18 European centres, and were not on medication for hypertension. Resting blood pressure at entry was at least 75 and no more than 90 mm Hg diastolic, and no more than 155 mm Hg systolic. Urinary albumin excretion rate (AER) was centrally assessed by means of two overnight urine collections at baseline, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. There were no difference in baseline characteristics by treatment group; mean AER was 8.0 micrograms/min in both groups; and prevalence of microalbuminuria was 13% and 17% in the placebo and lisinopril groups, respectively. On intention-to-treat analysis at 2 years, AER was 2.2 micrograms/min lower in the lisinopril than in the placebo group, a percentage difference of 18.8% (95% CI 2.0-32.7, p = 0.03), adjusted for baseline AER and centre, absolute difference 2.2 micrograms/min. In people with normoalbuminuria, the treatment difference was 1.0 microgram/min (12.7% [-2.9 to 26.0], p = 0.1). In those with microalbuminuria, however, the treatment difference was 34.2 micrograms/min (49.7% [-14.5 to 77.9], p = 0.1; for interaction, p = 0.04). For patients who completed 24 months on the trial, the final treatment difference in AER was 38.5 micrograms/min in those with microalbuminuria at baseline (p = 0.001), and 0.23 microgram/min in those with normoalbuminuria at baseline (p = 0.6). There was no treatment difference in hypoglycaemic events or in metabolic control as assessed by glycated haemoglobin. Lisinopril slows the progression of renal disease in normotensive IDDM patients with little or no albuminuria, though greatest effect was in those with microalbuminuria (AER > or = 20 micrograms/min). Our results show that lisinopril does not increase the risk of hypoglycaemic events in IDDM.","There are 3 prospective randomized controlled trials studying the effect of ACE inhibitors on albumin excretion for patients with diabetes who do not have microalbuminuria. A 2-year randomized controlled trial compared lisinopril (Prinivil; Zestril) 10 mg/d with placebo in 530 normotensive adults (aged 20-59 years) with insulin-dependent diabetes, defined as those diagnosed with diabetes before age 36 and using continuous insulin therapy within 1 year of diagnosis. At the beginning of the study, 90 patients had microalbuminuria-defined as an albumin excretion rate (AER) >29 mg/24 hr-and 440 patients did not. When the results for all patients who had and did not have microalbuminuria were combined, there was a significantly smaller rise in the AER for the lisinopril group vs the placebo group (3.2 mg/24 hr lower; P=.03). However, for the patients without initial microalbuminuria, the reduction in the rise of AER with lisinopril was not significant (1.4 mg/24 hr lower; P=.10). The decreased rate of developing new microalbuminuria was also not significant (relative risk reduction [RRR]=12.7%; P=.10)."
"When is it OK for children to start drinking fruit juice
To examine the relationship between consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (eg, nondiet carbonated drinks and fruit drinks) and the prevalence of overweight among preschool-aged children living in Canada. Data come from the Longitudinal Study of Child Development in Québec (1998-2002). A representative sample (n=2,103) of children born in 1998 in Québec, Canada. A total of 1,944 children (still representative of the same-age children in this population) remaining at 4 to 5 years in 2002 participated in the nutrition study. Data were collected via 24-hour dietary recall interview. Frequency of sugar-sweetened beverage consumption between meals at age 2.5, 3.5, and 4.5 years was recorded and children's height and weight were measured. Multivariate regression analysis was done with Statistical Analysis System software. Weighted data were adjusted for within-child variability and significance level was set at 5%. Overall, 6.9% of children who were nonconsumers of sugar-sweetened beverages between meals between the ages of 2.5 to 4.5 years were overweight at 4.5 years, compared to 15.4% of regular consumers (four to six times or more per week) at ages 2.5 years, 3.5 years, and 4.5 years. According to multivariate analysis, sugar-sweetened beverage consumption between meals more than doubles the odds of being overweight when other important factors are considered in multivariate analysis. Children from families with insufficient income who consume sugar-sweetened beverages regularly between the ages of 2.5 and 4.5 years are more than three times more likely to be overweight at age 4.5 years compared to nonconsuming children from sufficient income households. Regular sugar-sweetened beverage consumption between meals may put some young children at a greater risk for overweight. Parents should limit the quantity of sweetened beverages consumed during preschool years because it may increase propensity to gain weight.",Cohort data show that children who regularly consume sugar-sweetened beverages are twice as likely to be overweight by 5 years of age as children who don't.
"When is it OK for children to start drinking fruit juice
In a referral population of young children, excessive fruit juice consumption has been reported to be a contributing factor in nonorganic failure to thrive. To evaluate, in a population-based sample of healthy children, fruit juice consumption and its effects on growth parameters during early childhood. Cross-sectional study. General primary care health center in upstate New York. One hundred sixteen 2-year-old children and one hundred seven 5-year-old children, who were scheduled for a nonacute visit, and their primary care taker/parent were recruited over a 2-year period. For 168 children (ninety-four 2-year-old children and seventy-four 5-year-old children), mean dietary intake was calculated from 7 days of written dietary records, entered, and analyzed using the Minnesota Nutrition Data System. Height was measured using a Harpenden Stadiometer. Weight was measured using a standard balance beam scale. The 2-year-old and 5-year-old children consumed, on average, 5.9 and 5.0 fl oz/day of fruit juice and 9.8 and 11.0 fl oz/day of milk, respectively. Nineteen children (11%) consumed > or = 12 fl oz/day of juice. Forty-two percent of children consuming > or = 12 fl oz/day of juice had short stature (height less than 20th sex-specific percentile for age) vs 14% of children drinking less than 12 fl oz/day of juice. Obesity was more common among children drinking > or = 12 fl oz/day of juice compared with those drinking less juice: 53% vs 32% had a body mass index > or = 75th age- and sex-specific percentile; 32% vs 9% had a body mass index > or = 90th age- and sex-specific percentile; and 32% vs 5% had a ponderal index > or = 90th age-specific percentile. After adjustment for maternal height, child age, child sex, and child age-sex interaction, children consuming > or = 12 fl oz/day of juice, compared with those drinking less than 12 fl oz/day of juice, were shorter (86.5 vs 89.3 cm and 106.5 vs 111.2 cm for the 2-year-old and 5-year-old children, respectively) and more overweight (body mass index = 17.2 vs 16.3 kg/m2 and ponderal index = 18.4 vs 16.8 kg/m3). Consumption of > or = 12 fl oz/day of fruit juice by young children was associated with short stature and with obesity. Parents and care takers should limit young children's consumption of fruit juice to less than 12 fl oz/day.","The role of fruit juice consumption in childhood obesity is controversial. In 1 group of 168 children 2 to 5 years of age, 9% of children who drank >12 oz of fruit juice per day were overweight, compared with 3% of those who drank <12 oz daily."
"When is it OK for children to start drinking fruit juice
To describe transitions and patterns in infants' and toddlers' beverage intakes, with focus on nonmilk beverages. A cross-sectional study was conducted by telephone to obtain a 24-hour dietary recall of infants' and toddlers' food intakes, as reported by mothers or other primary caregivers. A nationwide sample of infants and toddlers (n=3,022) ages 4 to 24 months, who participated in the Feeding Infants and Toddlers Study (FITS). Beverages were categorized as total milks (ie, breast milk, infant formulas, cow's milk, soy milk, goat's milk), 100% juices, fruit drinks, carbonated beverages, water, and ""other."" Analyses included means +/- standard deviations, percentages, frequencies, nutrient densities, and linear regression. Beverages provided 84% of total daily food energy for infants 4 to 6 months of age, decreasing to 36% at ages 19 to 24 months. Apple juice and apple-flavored fruit drinks were the most frequently consumed beverages in the 100% juice and fruit drink categories, respectively. Juices, fruit drinks, and carbonated beverages appeared to displace milk in toddlers' diets (P<.0001). This research shows that beverages make important contributions to infants' and toddlers' energy and nutrient needs, but they must be wisely chosen. Registered dietitians should advise parents and caregivers that excessive intakes of any beverage, including milks and 100% juices, may displace other foods and beverages in the diet and/or contribute to excess food energy (kcal). Further research is needed to define excessive amounts in each beverage category, and such guidance could be very useful to parents and caregivers of infants and toddlers.","Overweight children are more likely than normal-weight children to be overweight as adults; they're at significant risk for morbidity and mortality from hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes in adulthood. Establishing sound nutritional habits-including appropriate consumption of fruit juices, fruit drinks, and other sugar-sweetened beverages-early in life plays an important role in preventing overweight in later childhood and adulthood."

The prevalence of overweight in children and adolescents and obesity in adults in the United States has increased over several decades. To provide current estimates of the prevalence and trends of overweight in children and adolescents and obesity in adults. Analysis of height and weight measurements from 3958 children and adolescents aged 2 to 19 years and 4431 adults aged 20 years or older obtained in 2003-2004 as part of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), a nationally representative sample of the US population. Data from the NHANES obtained in 1999-2000 and in 2001-2002 were compared with data from 2003-2004. Estimates of the prevalence of overweight in children and adolescents and obesity in adults. Overweight among children and adolescents was defined as at or above the 95th percentile of the sex-specific body mass index (BMI) for age growth charts. Obesity among adults was defined as a BMI of 30 or higher; extreme obesity was defined as a BMI of 40 or higher. In 2003-2004, 17.1% of US children and adolescents were overweight and 32.2% of adults were obese. Tests for trend were significant for male and female children and adolescents, indicating an increase in the prevalence of overweight in female children and adolescents from 13.8% in 1999-2000 to 16.0% in 2003-2004 and an increase in the prevalence of overweight in male children and adolescents from 14.0% to 18.2%. Among men, the prevalence of obesity increased significantly between 1999-2000 (27.5%) and 2003-2004 (31.1%). Among women, no significant increase in obesity was observed between 1999-2000 (33.4%) and 2003-2004 (33.2%). The prevalence of extreme obesity (body mass index > or =40) in 2003-2004 was 2.8% in men and 6.9% in women. In 2003-2004, significant differences in obesity prevalence remained by race/ethnicity and by age. Approximately 30% of non-Hispanic white adults were obese as were 45.0% of non-Hispanic black adults and 36.8% of Mexican Americans. Among adults aged 20 to 39 years, 28.5% were obese while 36.8% of adults aged 40 to 59 years and 31.0% of those aged 60 years or older were obese in 2003-2004. The prevalence of overweight among children and adolescents and obesity among men increased significantly during the 6-year period from 1999 to 2004; among women, no overall increases in the prevalence of obesity were observed. These estimates were based on a 6-year period and suggest that the increases in body weight are continuing in men and in children and adolescents while they may be leveling off in women.",One of every 6 American children is overweight or at risk of becoming overweight.
"When is it OK for children to start drinking fruit juice
We assessed whether sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) consumption increases fatness in British children. Data from a subsample of the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children were analyzed. Diet was assessed at ages 5 y (n = 521) and 7 y (n = 682) using 3-d diet diaries. Beverages were categorized into SSB, low energy, fruit juice, milk, and water. Fat mass was measured at age 9 y using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. The association between consumption of SSB at each age and fatness was examined using linear regression adjusted for potentially confounding variables. SSB accounted for 15% of all drinks consumed and 3% of total energy intake at both ages. There was no evidence of an association between SSB consumption at 5 or 7 y of age and fatness at age 9 y. There was a small positive correlation between low-energy drinks at age 5 and 7 y and fatness at 9 y (age 5 y, rho = 0.21, P < 0.001; age 7 y, rho = 0.16, P < 0.001), which was explained by existing overweight status at ages 5 and 7 y. In this cohort of British children there was no evidence of an association between SSB consumption at age 5 or 7 y and fatness at age 9 y. The positive relation between consumption of low-energy beverages and fatness at 9 y, which was explained by overweight status at 5 and 7 y, suggests that heavier children may consume low-energy beverages as part of an ineffective weight-control program.",1 cohort of 521 children followed longitudinally from 5 to 9 years showed no association between sugar-sweetened beverage intake and body fat.
"Which interventions are best for alleviating nipple pain in nursing mothers
To review the literature on nipple pain and to delineate effective strategies for the prevention and treatment of nipple pain in breastfeeding mothers. Computerized searches on MEDLINE, Pre-MEDLINE, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library. Articles from indexed journals relevant to the objective were reviewed from January 1983 to April 2004. Preference was given to research-based studies in English. Data were extracted and organized under two headings: prevention of nipple pain or trauma and treatment of nipple pain or trauma. The Critical Appraisal Form by J. Briggs was used to extract the data from research-based articles. The health benefits of breastfeeding for mother and infant are well documented; however, nipple pain is a common reason reported by women for the early termination of breastfeeding. Several studies have compared various treatments for either the prevention of or treatment for nipple pain. These treatments include warm water compresses, tea bag compresses, heat, application of expressed mother's milk, lanolin, vitamin A, collagenase, dexpanthenol, hydrogel therapy, glycerin gel therapy, moist occlusive dressing, education regarding proper latch-on and positioning, and no treatment. No one topical agent showed superior results in the relief of nipple discomfort. The most important factor in decreasing the incidence of nipple pain is the provision of education in relation to proper breastfeeding technique and latch-on as well as anticipatory guidance regarding the high incidence of early postpartum nipple pain.",Breast shields were ineffective in 1 RCT.
"Does birth weight predict childhood obesity
To identify factors in childhood which might influence the development of obesity in adulthood. The prevalence of obesity is increasing in the UK and other developed countries, in adults and children. The adverse health consequences of adult obesity are well documented, but are less certain for childhood obesity. An association between fatness in adolescence and undesirable socio-economic consequences, such as lower educational attainment and income, has been observed, particularly for women. Childhood factors implicated in the development of adult obesity therefore have far-reaching implications for costs to the health-services and economy. In order to identify relevant studies, electronic databases--Medline, Embase, CAB abstracts, Psyclit and Sport Discus-were searched from the start date of the database to Spring 1998. The general search structure for electronic databases was (childhood or synonyms) AND (fatness or synonyms) AND (longitudinal or synonyms). Further studies were identified by citations in retrieved papers and by consultation with experts. Longitudinal observational studies of healthy children which included measurement of a risk factor in childhood (<18 y), and outcome measure at least 1 y later. Any measure of fatness, leanness or change in fatness or leanness was accepted. Measures of fat distribution were not included. Only studies with participants from an industrialized country were considered, and those concerning minority or special groups, e.g. Pima Indians or children born preterm, were excluded. Risk factors for obesity included parental fatness, social factors, birth weight, timing or rate of maturation, physical activity, dietary factors and other behavioural or psychological factors. Offspring of obese parent(s) were consistently seen to be at increased risk of fatness, although few studies have looked at this relationship over longer periods of childhood and into adulthood. The relative contributions of genes and inherited lifestyle factors to the parent-child fatness association remain largely unknown. No clear relationship is reported between socio-economic status (SES) in early life and childhood fatness. However, a strong consistent relationship is observed between low SES in early life and increased fatness in adulthood. Studies investigating SES were generally large but very few considered confounding by parental fatness. Women who change social class (social mobility) show the prevalence of obesity of the class they join, an association which is not present in men. The influence of other social factors such as family size, number of parents at home and childcare have been little researched. There is good evidence from large and reasonably long-term studies for an apparently clear relationship for increased fatness with higher birth weight, but in studies which attempted to address potential confounding by gestational age, parental fatness, or social group, the relationship was less consistent. The relationship between earlier maturation and greater subsequent fatness was investigated in predominantly smaller, but also a few large studies. Again, this relationship appeared to be consistent, but in general, the studies had not investigated whether there was confounding by other factors, including parental fatness, SES, earlier fatness in childhood, or dietary or activity behaviours. Studies investigating the role of diet or activity were generally small, and included diverse methods of risk factor measurement. There was almost no evidence for an influence of activity in infancy on later fatness, and inconsistent but suggestive evidence for a protective effect of activity in childhood on later fatness. No clear evidence for an effect of infant feeding on later fatness emerged, but follow-up to adulthood was rare, with only one study measuring fatness after 7y. Studies investigating diet in childhood were limited and inconc","A systematic review of 19 longitudinal, observational studies comparing birth weight with later BMI indicates that the association between the 2 is positive and consistent in multiple cohorts. Eleven studies focused on outcomes in childhood; another 8 measured outcomes into adulthood. Fifteen of the 19 studies (79%), ranging in size from 1028 to 92,940 subjects, found a positive association between birth weight and later BMI. However, the data were too heterogeneous to combine into a single summary measure. One representative study quantified the relative risk (RR) for severe obesity (>95th percentile BMI) at 5 years of age as 1.7 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2-2.9) for birth weights between the 85th and 94th percentiles and 1.8 (95% CI, 1.1-2.9) for birth weights greater than the 95th percentile. Studies that didn't find such an association had smaller sample sizes (137 to 432 subjects) and, therefore, may have lacked the power to detect an association."
"What is the clinical workup for failure to thrive
Failure to thrive is a common problem in infancy and childhood. It is most often multifactorial in origin. Inadequate nutrition and disturbed social interactions contribute to poor weight gain, delayed development, and abnormal behavior. The syndrome develops in a significant number of children as a consequence of child neglect. This clinical report is intended to focus the pediatrician on the consideration, evaluation, and management of failure to thrive when child neglect may be present. Child protective services agencies should be notified when the evaluation leads to a suspicion of abuse or neglect.",FTT has been variously defined in children who have weight-for-length <80% of ideal weight.
"What's the most effective treatment for giardiasis
A prospective randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted to assess the efficacy and safety of nitazoxanide in the treatment of diarrhea caused by Giardia intestinalis or Entamoeba histolytica and/or E. dispar in 89 adults and adolescents, 22 of whom were diagnosed with G. intestinalis, 53 with E. histolytica and/or E. dispar, and 14 with both G. intestinalis and E. histolytica and/or E. dispar. The study medication was administered as 1 nitazoxanide 500-mg tablet or a matching placebo twice daily for 3 days. Thirty-eight (81%) of 47 patients in the nitazoxanide treatment group resolved diarrhea within 7 days (median, 3 days) after initiation of treatment, versus 17 (40%) of 42 in the placebo group (P=.0002). With its efficacy in treating a broad spectrum of enteric protozoan pathogens, nitazoxanide could play an important role in the management of diarrhea caused by enteric protozoa, reducing morbidity and costs associated with these diarrheal illnesses.",Two RCTs found nitazoxanide to be effective (number needed to treat [NNT]=1.82) compared to placebo in adolescents and adults.
"What's the most effective treatment for giardiasis
Enteric infection by Giardia intestinalis is a common cause of diarrhoea world-wide and a significant cause of morbidity in children. To compare the efficacy and safety of nitazoxanide and metronidazole in the treatment of diarrhoea caused by G. intestinalis in children. A total of 110 children presenting with diarrhoea caused by G. intestinalis were randomized to treatment with either a 3-day course of nitazoxanide (100 mg b.d., age range 2-3 years; 200 mg b.d., age range 4-11 years) or a 5-day course of metronidazole (125 mg b.d., age range 2-5 years; 250 mg b.d., age range 6-11 years). The patients were followed-up for a determination of clinical response 7 days after the initiation of treatment, and two subsequent stool samples were collected for parasitological examination. Diarrhoea had resolved in 47 children out of 55 (85%) in the nitazoxanide treatment group before the day 7 follow-up visit, compared to 44 out of 55 (80%) for metronidazole. Diarrhoea resolved within 4 days in most cases. Only mild, transient adverse events were reported. A 3-day course of nitazoxanide suspension is as efficacious as a standard 5-day course of metronidazole suspension in treating giardiasis in children.","A 3-day course of nitazoxanide was as effective as 5 days of metronidazole (80% vs 85%, P=0.61) in resolving clinical giardiasis."
"How soon should serum potassium levels be monitored for patients started on diuretics
Nineteen men with mild to moderate hypertension and without a history of cardiac arrhythmias were randomized (double-blind) into groups to receive hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) at a dose of 25 mg/day, HCTZ at 50 mg/day, or HCTZ (25 mg) plus triamterene (50 mg) for a six-month period after a three-week (single-blind) placebo period. Serum electrolyte values were determined at baseline and at frequent intervals thereafter. Twenty-four hour ambulatory electrocardiograms were obtained at baseline and just before study termination. Mild hypokalemia (less than 3.5 mEq/L) occurred in approximately half of the patients and was unrelated to treatment group. Serious arrhythmias were infrequent, though some patients had large numbers of extra beats. The incidence of arrhythmia appeared unrelated to serum potassium concentration. We conclude that mild hypokalemia associated with low-dose diuretic therapy for hypertension is not arrhythmogenic.",The time period required to develop hypokalemia can be (1 week).
"What are the treatment options for SSRI-related sexual dysfunction
To evaluate the possible influence of buspirone on sexual dysfunction in depressed patients treated with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), we analyzed data from a placebo-controlled trial designed to explore the efficacy of buspirone as add-on treatment for patients not responding to an SSRI alone. At baseline, all patients met the criteria for a major depressive episode according to DSM-IV and had received citalopram or paroxetine during a minimum of 4 weeks without responding to the treatment. Buspirone (flexible dosage, 20-60 mg/day) or placebo was added to the SSRI for 4 weeks; the mean daily dose of buspirone at endpoint was 48.5 mg (SD = 1.0). Sexual dysfunction was evaluated using a structured interview. Before starting medication with buspirone or placebo, 40% (47 of 117) reported at least one kind of sexual dysfunction (decreased libido, ejaculatory dysfunction, orgasmic dysfunction). During the 4 weeks of treatment, approximately 58% of subjects treated with buspirone reported an improvement with respect to sexual function; in the placebo group, the response rate was 30%. The difference between placebo and active drug treatment was more pronounced in women than in men. The response was obvious during the first week, with no further improvement during the course of the study. It is suggested that the effect of buspirone on sexual dysfunction is a result of a reversal of SSRI-induced sexual side effects rather than of an antidepressant effect of the drug.","In on augmentation therapy, buspirone augmentation resulted in a statistical improvement in sexual functioning at weeks 2 and 3 of therapy, but not at weeks 1 and 4 (mean dose 48.5 mg per day)."
"What are the treatment options for SSRI-related sexual dysfunction
Few controlled trials of pharmacologic intervention in women with antidepressant-associated sexual dysfunction have been reported, and there is uncertainty about the usefulness of putative treatments and the assessment methodologies. The authors evaluated the efficacy of buspirone and amantadine in the treatment of sexual dysfunction associated with fluoxetine administration. Women who had been successfully treated with fluoxetine for at least 8 weeks and who had reported a deterioration in sexual function not present before the initiation of fluoxetine entered a 4-week assessment period. After assessment they were randomly assigned to an 8-week treatment trial with buspirone (N=19), amantadine (N=18), or placebo (N=20). Outcomes were assessed by using a patient-rated daily diary and a clinician-rated structured interview. While the amantadine-treated women did report significantly greater improvements in energy levels than women in the placebo group, all treatment groups experienced improvement in overall sexual function as well as in most individual measures. There were no statistically significant differences among the three groups. Neither buspirone nor amantadine was more effective than placebo in ameliorating antidepressant-associated sexual dysfunction. All groups experienced marked nonspecific improvement during treatment, which suggests the importance of placebo-controlled trials for this condition.","In a trial, adding buspirone 20 to 30 mg per day, amantadine 50 to 100 mg per day, or placebo resulted in equal improvement in women's sexual function."
"What is angular cheilitis and how is it treated
This prospective study evaluated the significance of microbial analysis and antimicrobial treatment for the cure of angular cheilitis. Furthermore, various etiologic factors were investigated for their relative effect on the healing process. The study included 1) an open trial with 50 patients infected by Candida albicans and/or Staphylococcus aureus, and 2) an intraindividual comparison of eight patients with bilateral lesions infected by Candida albicans as the only detected pathogen. After a base-line examination the patients received ointments containing nystatin and/or fusidic acid, on the basis of the outcome of an initial microbial analysis. The patients were evaluated clinically, photographed, and examined for microorganisms at different time intervals. Ninety-six per cent of the patients who participated in the open trial had no sign of infection after 42 days of treatment. Lesions in the double-blind study, treated with nystatin, were healed after 28 days, whereas lesions that received placebo persisted throughout the treatment period. Increasing age, dry skin, and extended skinfolds at the corner of the mouth were factors closely related to the length of the healing process.","A prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 8 patients compared the efficacy of nystatin with placebo ointment. These patients were referred to a Department of Oral Diagnosis for sore lips with detected Candida albicans lesions located bilaterally. All of the patients were instructed to use one ointment on the right side and the other on the left side. Contamination was prevented by the use of gloves changed between applications. All 8 patients demonstrated complete healing after 1 to 4 weeks of treatment by nystatin, whereas only 1 patient had complete healing after the placebo, giving a number needed to treat (NNT) of 1.14 (P<.001)."
"Is DEET safe for children
N,N-Diethyl-m-toluamide, an effective tick repellent, when applied to the skin, is the major component of essentially all of the products marketed for this purpose. It is used by about 30% of the US population, and by 23-29% of children in this population. Reports of neurologic adversity and death are rare and primarily involve children, but the dose relationship between N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide exposure and the symptoms reported in the clinical literature is difficult to establish. Animal toxicology studies, clinical reports of neurological adversities in children and adults, and the available Poison Control Center records have been reviewed in an effort to understand the relationship between the N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide exposure and reported adverse events. Based on (1) the animal toxicology database on N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide, (2) the reports of adverse events in humans, and (3) the possible alternate etiologies for the symptoms reported in most patients, the risk of adversity from label-directed use of N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide appears low. Future efforts should focus on the prospective collection of adversity data with special attention paid to the documentation of clinical effects.","A review was sponsored by SC Johnson and Company, the makers of OFF! brand insect repellent. It assessed animal studies, epidemiologic data, and case reports, and supported the safety of DEET in children."
"Is DEET safe for children
Toxicology studies are typically performed on single compounds, which we hypothesized would miss adverse synergies from chemical mixtures. This hypothesis was tested using an insect repellant and sunscreens because both groups include known permeation enhancers, with prior pediatric reports of toxicity from highly concentrated DEET (N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide). Using real-time mass spectroscopy in a hairless mouse skin model, we confirmed substantial penetration of a 20% DEET standard. Despite a lower (10%) DEET content, a commercially marketed sunscreen formulation had a 6-fold more rapid detection (5 versus 30 min) and 3.4-fold greater penetration at steady state. We also tested the efficacy of DEET microemulsion products and confirmed that one successfully slowed the onset of absorption, but not the steady-state permeation. Risks from mixtures of potential toxins are worthy of routine testing, which can be accomplished by simple assays, and are of utmost importance for pediatric applications.","Some studies have uncovered dangerous interactions with military and industrial chemicals, but such exposures are unlikely in most children. The most practical concern regards sun-screen. One study reported that use of sun-screen increased the penetration of DEET."
"Do endovascular filters prevent PE as effectively as anticoagulants in patients with DVT
The bird's nest inferior vena cava filter, in clinical trial since 1982, has been placed in 568 patients at risk for pulmonary embolism. Of the 481 patients in whom the filter had been in place for 6 months or more, 440 were followed up clinically. The prevalence of clinically suspected recurrent pulmonary thromboembolism was 2.7% (12 patients) and that of inferior vena cava filter occlusion was 2.9% (13 patients). With the initial filter design, filter migration occurred in five patients. No migrations have occurred in the 147 patients treated with the filter after its modification to improve the anchoring system for greater stability. The bird's nest filter has proved safe and effective in the prevention of pulmonary embolism.","A prospective cohort study followed 481 patients who received an IVCF because of either a contraindication to anticoagulation or sustained recurrent embolization despite adequate anticoagulation. Of the patients who had a filter for 6 months or longer, 2% had clinically suspected PE, but PE was confirmed in only 0.5%."
"Do hyaluronic acid injections relieve OA knee pain
Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most prevalent chronic joint disorder worldwide and is associated with significant pain and disability. To assess the effects of viscosupplementation in the treatment of OA of the knee. The products were hyaluronan and hylan derivatives (Adant, Arthrum H, Artz (Artzal, Supartz), BioHy (Arthrease, Euflexxa, Nuflexxa), Durolane, Fermathron, Go-On, Hyalgan, Hylan G-F 20 (Synvisc Hylan G-F 20), Hyruan, NRD-101 (Suvenyl), Orthovisc, Ostenil, Replasyn, SLM-10, Suplasyn, Synject and Zeel compositum). MEDLINE (up to January (week 1) 2006 for update), EMBASE, PREMEDLINE, Current Contents up to July 2003, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) were searched. Specialised journals and reference lists of identified randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and pertinent review articles up to December 2005 were handsearched. RCTs of viscosupplementation for the treatment of people with a diagnosis of OA of the knee were eligible. Single and double-blinded studies, placebo-based and comparative studies were eligible. At least one of the four OMERACT III core set outcome measures had to be reported (Bellamy 1997). Each trial was assessed independently by two reviewers for its methodological quality using a validated tool. All data were extracted by one reviewer and verified by a second reviewer . Continuous outcome measures were analysed as weighted mean differences (WMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). However, where different scales were used to measure the same outcome, standardized mean differences (SMD) were used. Dichotomous outcomes were analyzed by relative risk (RR). Seventy-six trials with a median quality score of 3 (range 1 to 5) were identified. Follow-up periods varied between day of last injection and eighteen months. Forty trials included comparisons of hyaluronan/hylan and placebo (saline or arthrocentesis), ten trials included comparisons of intra-articular (IA) corticosteroids, six trials included comparisons of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), three trials included comparisons of physical therapy, two trials included comparisons of exercise, two trials included comparisons of arthroscopy, two trials included comparisons of conventional treatment, and fifteen trials included comparisons of other hyaluronans/hylan. The pooled analyses of the effects of viscosupplements against 'placebo' controls generally supported the efficacy of this class of intervention. In these same analyses, differential efficacy effects were observed for different products on different variables and at different timepoints. Of note is the 5 to 13 week post injection period which showed a percent improvement from baseline of 28 to 54% for pain and 9 to 32% for function. In general, comparable efficacy was noted against NSAIDs and longer-term benefits were noted in comparisons against IA corticosteroids. In general, few adverse events were reported in the hyaluronan/hylan trials included in these analyses. Based on the aforementioned analyses, viscosupplementation is an effective treatment for OA of the knee with beneficial effects: on pain, function and patient global assessment; and at different post injection periods but especially at the 5 to 13 week post injection period. It is of note that the magnitude of the clinical effect, as expressed by the WMD and standardised mean difference (SMD) from the RevMan 4.2 output, is different for different products, comparisons, timepoints, variables and trial designs. However, there are few randomised head-to-head comparisons of different viscosupplements and readers should be cautious, therefore, in drawing conclusions regarding the relative value of different products. The clinical effect for some products, against placebo, on some variables at some timepoints is in the moderate to large effect-size range. Readers should refer to relevant tables to review specific detail given the heterogeneity in effects across the product class and some discrepancies observed between the RevMan 4.2 analyses and the original publications. Overall, the analyses performed are positive for the HA class and particularly positive for some products with respect to certain variables and timepoints, such as pain on weight bearing at 5 to 13 weeks postinjection. In general, sample-size restrictions preclude any definitive comment on the safety of the HA class of products; however, within the constraints of the trial designs employed no major safety issues were detected. In some analyses viscosupplements were comparable in efficacy to systemic forms of active intervention, with more local reactions but fewer systemic adverse events. In other analyses HA products had more prolonged effects than IA corticosteroids. Overall, the aforementioned analyses support the use of the HA class of products in the treatment of knee OA.","A Cochrane meta-analysis conducted the following year, HA was found to have positive results."
"Do hyaluronic acid injections relieve OA knee pain
Osteoarthritis of the knee affects up to 10% of the elderly population. The condition is frequently treated by intra-articular injection of hyaluronic acid. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to assess the effectiveness of this treatment. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, BIOSIS and the Cochrane Controlled Trial Register from inception until April 2004 using a combination of search terms for knee osteoarthritis and hyaluronic acid and a filter for randomized controlled trials. We extracted data on pain at rest, pain during or immediately after movement, joint function and adverse events. Twenty-two trials that reported usable quantitative information on any of the predefined end points were identified and included in the systematic review. Even though pain at rest may be improved by hyaluronic acid, the data available from these studies did not allow an appropriate assessment of this end point. Patients who received the intervention experienced a reduction in pain during movement: the mean difference on a 100-mm visual analogue scale was -3.8 mm (95% confidence interval [CI] -9.1 to 1.4 mm) after 2-6 weeks, -4.3 mm (95% CI -7.6 to -0.9 mm) after 10-14 weeks and -7.1 mm (95% CI -11.8 to -2.4 mm) after 22-30 weeks. However, this effect was not compatible with a clinically meaningful difference (expected to be about 15 mm on the visual analogue scale). Furthermore, the effect was exaggerated by trials not reporting an intention-to-treat analysis. No improvement in knee function was observed at any time point. Even so, the effect of hyaluronic acid on knee function was more favourable when allocation was not concealed. Adverse events occurred slightly more often among patients who received the intervention (relative risk 1.08, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.15). Only 4 trials explicitly reported allocation concealment, had blinded outcome assessment and presented intention-to-treat data. According to the currently available evidence, intra-articular hyaluronic acid has not been proven clinically effective and may be associated with a greater risk of adverse events. Large trials with clinically relevant and uniform end points are necessary to clarify the benefit-risk ratio.","A 2005 meta-analysis evaluated the effectiveness of HA injections for osteoarthritis of the knee compared with saline placebo. Researchers identified 22 studies of 8 HA products that used the common end point of pain with movement. A decrease in pain of 15% was deemed clinically meaningful. Compared with placebo, the mean difference in pain scores with HA products was -4% (95% confidence interval [CI], -9% to 1%) after 2 to 6 weeks; -4% (95% CI, -8% to -1%) after 10 to 14 weeks; and -7% (95% CI, -12% to -2%) after 22 to 30 weeks. The authors note that the small measured effect of HA was magnified by trials that didn't report intention-to-treat results. The effect of HA was also larger in studies that didn't conceal allocation. A weakness of the analysis was its inability to assess potential differences between HA products. In this 2005 meta-analysis, HA injection didn't improve knee function in any time interval."
"Do nonmedicated topicals relieve childhood eczema
Thirty patients with mild to moderate bilateral atopic eczema were treated on one side of the body with a new purified coal tar cream (Clinitar) and on the other side with 1% hydrocortisone cream, for 4 weeks. The degree of infiltration of the skin erythema, lichenification, excoriations and dryness were assessed. Both treatments were equally effective in reducing symptoms and there was also no difference in patient preference and cosmetic acceptability.",Only 1 study has evaluated the use of tar: a comparison of 30 patients (mean age 11.8 years) who were treated with tar on one side of the body and 1% hydrocortisone on the other. Both treatments produced comparable results and were well tolerated. But compliance can be a problem with tar products because they smell unpleasant and stain clothing.
"Do nonmedicated topicals relieve childhood eczema
To examine the efficacy and safety of MAS063DP (Atopiclair) cream in the management of mild to moderate atopic dermatitis in infants and children. One hundred forty-two patients aged 6 months to 12 years were administered MAS063DP (n = 72) or vehicle (n = 70) cream 3 times per day to affected areas and sites prone to develop atopic dermatitis. The primary endpoint for efficacy was the Investigator's Global Assessment at day 22. Secondary endpoints included Investigator's Global Assessment at other time-points, patient's/caregiver's assessment of pruritus, onset, duration of itch relief, Eczema Area and Severity Index, subject's/caregiver's assessment of global response, and need for rescue medication in the event of an atopic dermatitis flare. MAS063DP cream was statistically more effective (P < .0001) than vehicle cream for the primary endpoint and all secondary endpoints. Treatment discontinuation as a result of an adverse event occurred in 9.9% of patients using MAS063DP cream and 16% of patients using vehicle cream. MAS063DP cream is effective and safe as monotherapy for the treatment of symptoms of mild to moderate atopic dermatitis in infants and children.","MAS063DP is a nonsteroidal, hydrolipidic cream containing glycyrrhetinic acid (GrA), vitis vinifera (grapevine extract), and telmestine. A recent multicenter RCT of 142 children compared MAS063DP to vehicle cream alone. The primary outcome was treatment success defined as an Investigator's Global Assessment score of ≤1 (range 0-5), measured on day 22. Therapy was successful in 77% of the treatment group vs 0% of the vehicle-only group (number needed to treat=1)."
"What's the best strategy for bipolar disorder during pregnancy
There are obvious gaps in research surrounding issues specific to women who suffer from bipolar disorder, including gender differences and their implications for management, the impact of the reproductive cycle, and evidence based treatment guidelines for pregnancy and the postpartum period. Gender differences have not been reported for the prevalence of bipolar disorder; however, women are more likely to experience rapid cycling, mixed mania, and antidepressant-induced manias. This may affect response to treatment, which has been found, in some cases, to differ in men and women. In addition, side effects in response to treatments may well differ in men and women, especially with regard to lithium and valproate prescription. The course of bipolar disorder in women may be influenced by the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, the postpartum period, and menopause, although many issues require further clarification. Treatment of bipolar disorder during pregnancy and the postmenopausal period requires careful consideration, as does treatment during the childbearing years, as some mood stabilizers influence the metabolism of oral contraceptives. This review article has attempted to evaluate existing literature regarding women with bipolar disorder in a comprehensive and critical way, and to consolidate into a single source the gender-specific aspects of the disorder that may have treatment implications for women.","Following delivery, you'll need to decrease the dose of lithium to prepregnancy doses, unless there is an acute destabilization of mood."

Mood disorders in pregnancy may have a negative effect on self care and pregnancy outcome that affects the mother directly and the child indirectly. Thus, some women may require pharmacological treatment. Pharmacotherapy of mood disorders during pregnancy implies specific considerations. This paper presents an updated review of available studies on the treatment of mood disorders and present knowledge on teratogenicity, neonatal effects and long-term neurobehavioural effects for the different psychotropic drugs, including treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), other antidepressants, benzodiazepines, lithium, carbamazepine/valproic acid, lamotrigine and novel antipsychotics. However, the existing knowledge on the use of antidepressants and mood stabilising agents during pregnancy is hampered by a lack of results from randomised controlled trials.SSRIs and TCAs have not been associated with an increased risk of major malformations, but poor neonatal adaptation has been described. Benzodiazepines used in the first trimester have been associated with orofacial clefts. Mood stabilisers such as lithium, carbamazepine and valproic acid (sodium valproate) are associated with an increased risk of fetal malformations. Both benzodiazepines and lithium may cause adaptation problems in the newborn. In utero exposure to novel antipsychotics has not been associated with congenital malformations; however, the data are still limited. The knowledge about long-term neurobehavioural effects in the offspring is still limited for all agents and requires further investigation. Possible adverse effects of fetal exposure must be balanced against the adverse effects of an untreated maternal mood disorder.","Atypical antipsychotics have not been well studied, but there is no conclusive evidence that they cause fetal malformations."

"Is guaifenesin safe during pregnancy
The authors determined the prevalence of certain major congenital disorders among live-born infants of 6509 mothers in a prepaid health plan for the 30-month period of January 1, 1980 through June 30, 1982 who used a wide variety of drugs during the first trimester of pregnancy. The results were similar to those obtained in this population in a prior 30-month study. No strong associations between any of the commonly used drugs and the congenital disorders studied were present.","In a study evaluating 6509 women whose pregnancies resulted in live births, 241 women reported first-trimester exposure to guaifenesin. Five of the guaifenesin-exposed infants (2.1%) had 1 of the birth defects studied (types of disorders not reported). The calculated RR of birth defect after in utero guaifenesin exposure was 1.3 (no CIs or P values reported); the authors concluded that there was no strong association between guaifenesin and the malformations studied."
"Is combining ACE inhibitors and ARBs helpful or harmful
Angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors such as captopril reduce mortality and cardiovascular morbidity among patients with myocardial infarction complicated by left ventricular systolic dysfunction, heart failure, or both. In a double-blind trial, we compared the effect of the angiotensin-receptor blocker valsartan, the ACE inhibitor captopril, and the combination of the two on mortality in this population of patients. Patients receiving conventional therapy were randomly assigned, 0.5 to 10 days after acute myocardial infarction, to additional therapy with valsartan (4909 patients), valsartan plus captopril (4885 patients), or captopril (4909 patients). The primary end point was death from any cause. During a median follow-up of 24.7 months, 979 patients in the valsartan group died, as did 941 patients in the valsartan-and-captopril group and 958 patients in the captopril group (hazard ratio in the valsartan group as compared with the captopril group, 1.00; 97.5 percent confidence interval, 0.90 to 1.11; P=0.98; hazard ratio in the valsartan-and-captopril group as compared with the captopril group, 0.98; 97.5 percent confidence interval, 0.89 to 1.09; P=0.73). The upper limit of the one-sided 97.5 percent confidence interval for the comparison of the valsartan group with the captopril group was within the prespecified margin for noninferiority with regard to mortality (P=0.004) and with regard to the composite end point of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events (P<0.001). The valsartan-and-captopril group had the most drug-related adverse events. With monotherapy, hypotension and renal dysfunction were more common in the valsartan group, and cough, rash, and taste disturbance were more common in the captopril group. Valsartan is as effective as captopril in patients who are at high risk for cardiovascular events after myocardial infarction. Combining valsartan with captopril increased the rate of adverse events without improving survival.",The VALIANT demonstrated the safety but the lack of incremental efficacy in adding valsartan to ACE inhibitors for patients with left ventricular dysfunction after a myocardial infarction.
"Is combining ACE inhibitors and ARBs helpful or harmful
Angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers have favourable effects on haemodynamic measurements, neurohumoral activity, and left-ventricular remodelling when added to angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF). We aimed to find out whether these drugs improve clinical outcome. Between March, 1999, and November, 1999, we enrolled 2548 patients with New York Heart Association functional class II-IV CHF and left-ventricular ejection fraction 40% or lower, and who were being treated with ACE inhibitors. We randomly assigned patients candesartan (n=1276, target dose 32 mg once daily) or placebo (n=1272). At baseline, 55% of patients were also treated with beta blockers and 17% with spironolactone. The primary outcome of the study was the composite of cardiovascular death or hospital admission for CHF. Analysis was done by intention to treat. The median follow-up was 41 months. 483 (38%) patients in the candesartan group and 538 (42%) in the placebo group experienced the primary outcome (unadjusted hazard ratio 0.85 [95% CI 0.75-0.96], p=0.011; covariate adjusted p=0.010). Candesartan reduced each of the components of the primary outcome significantly, as well as the total number of hospital admissions for CHF. The benefits of candesartan were similar in all predefined subgroups, including patients receiving baseline beta blocker treatment. The addition of candesartan to ACE inhibitor and other treatment leads to a further clinically important reduction in relevant cardiovascular events in patients with CHF and reduced left-ventricular ejection fraction.","In CHARM, candesartan was added to baseline therapy among patients with heart failure. Baseline therapy included diuretics (90%), beta blockers (55%), spironolactone (17%), and other cardiovascular medications as necessary. In this study, those in the treatment arm had a decrease in the combined endpoint of cardiovascular death plus congestive heart failure admission (RR=0.85; 95% CI, 0.75-0.96), but no difference was seen in overall mortality. Of note, no adverse interaction was demonstrated for those on the triple combination of ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and beta-blockers."
"Is combining ACE inhibitors and ARBs helpful or harmful
Present angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor treatment fails to prevent progression of non-diabetic renal disease. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of combined treatment of angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor and angiotensin-II receptor blocker, and monotherapy of each drug at its maximum dose, in patients with non-diabetic renal disease. 336 patients with non-diabetic renal disease were enrolled from one renal outpatient department in Japan. After screening and an 18-week run-in period, 263 patients were randomly assigned angiotensin-II receptor blocker (losartan, 100 mg daily), angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor (trandolapril, 3 mg daily), or a combination of both drugs at equivalent doses. Survival analysis was done to compare the effects of each regimen on the combined primary endpoint of time to doubling of serum creatinine concentration or end-stage renal disease. Analysis was by intention to treat. Seven patients discontinued or were otherwise lost to follow-up. Ten (11%) of 85 patients on combination treatment reached the combined primary endpoint compared with 20 (23%) of 85 on trandolapril alone (hazard ratio 0.38, 95% CI 0.18-0.63, p=0.018) and 20 (23%) of 86 on losartan alone (0.40, 0.17-0.69, p=0.016). Covariates affecting renal survival were combination treatment (hazard ratio 0.38, 95% CI 0.18-0.63, p=0.011), age (1.30, 1.03-2.29, p=0.009), baseline renal function (1.80, 1.02-2.99, p=0.021), change in daily urinary protein excretion rate (0.58, 0.24-0.88, p=0.022), use of diuretics (0.80, 0.30-0.94, p=0.043), and antiproteinuric response to trandolapril (0.81, 0.21-0.91, p=0.039). Frequency of side-effects with combination treatment was the same as with trandolapril alone. Combination treatment safely retards progression of non-diabetic renal disease compared with monotherapy. However, since some patients reached the combined primary endpoint on combined treatment, further strategies for complete management of progressive non-diabetic renal disease need to be researched.",The COOPERATE trial was conducted in Japan and included 336 patients with nondiabetic renal disease. The investigators found that significantly fewer patients receiving combination therapy reached the combined primary endpoint of time to doubling of serum creatinine or end-stage renal disease compared with patients receiving monotherapy.
"Does lowering diastolic BP to less than 90 mm Hg decrease cardiovascular risk
There are 14 unconfounded randomised trials of antihypertensive drugs (chiefly diuretics or beta-blockers): total 37,000 individuals, mean treatment duration 5 years, mean diastolic blood pressure (DBP) difference 5-6 mm Hg. In prospective observational studies, a long-term difference of 5-6 mm Hg in usual DBP is associated with about 35-40% less stroke and 20-25% less coronary heart disease (CHD). For those dying in the trials, the DBP difference had persisted only 2-3 years, yet an overview showed that vascular mortality was significantly reduced (2p less than 0.0002); non-vascular mortality appeared unchanged. Stroke was reduced by 42% SD 6 (95% confidence interval 35-50%; 289 vs 484 events, 2p less than 0.0001), suggesting that virtually all the epidemiologically expected stroke reduction appears rapidly. CHD was reduced by 14% SD 5 (95% CI 4-22%; 671 vs 771 events, 2p less than 0.01), suggesting that just over half the epidemiologically expected CHD reduction appears rapidly. Although this significant CHD reduction could well be worthwhile, its size remains indefinite for most circumstances (though beta-blockers after myocardial infarction are of substantial benefit). At present, therefore, a sufficiently high risk of stroke (perhaps because of age, blood pressure, or, in particular, history of cerebrovascular disease) may be the clearest indication for antihypertensive treatment.","The concept of a continuous graded relationship between DBP and cardiovascular risk is supported by a meta-analysis of 14 randomized clinical trials showing that lowering DBP by 6 mm Hg reduced the risk of coronary heart disease by 14% (95% confidence interval [CI], 4%-22%; P<.01; NNT=200). Throughout the range of DBP in study subjects, 70-115 mm Hg, a lower DBP was associated with a lower risk of coronary heart disease."
"Do statins reduce the risk of stroke
The lowering of cholesterol concentrations in individuals at high risk of cardiovascular disease improves outcome. No study, however, has assessed benefits of cholesterol lowering in the primary prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD) in hypertensive patients who are not conventionally deemed dyslipidaemic. Of 19342 hypertensive patients (aged 40-79 years with at least three other cardiovascular risk factors) randomised to one of two antihypertensive regimens in the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial, 10305 with non-fasting total cholesterol concentrations 6.5 mmol/L or less were randomly assigned additional atorvastatin 10 mg or placebo. These patients formed the lipid-lowering arm of the study. We planned follow-up for an average of 5 years, the primary endpoint being non-fatal myocardial infarction and fatal CHD. Data were analysed by intention to treat. Treatment was stopped after a median follow-up of 3.3 years. By that time, 100 primary events had occurred in the atorvastatin group compared with 154 events in the placebo group (hazard ratio 0.64 [95% CI 0.50-0.83], p=0.0005). This benefit emerged in the first year of follow-up. There was no significant heterogeneity among prespecified subgroups. Fatal and non-fatal stroke (89 atorvastatin vs 121 placebo, 0.73 [0.56-0.96], p=0.024), total cardiovascular events (389 vs 486, 0.79 [0.69-0.90], p=0.0005), and total coronary events (178 vs 247, 0.71 [0.59-0.86], p=0.0005) were also significantly lowered. There were 185 deaths in the atorvastatin group and 212 in the placebo group (0.87 [0.71-1.06], p=0.16). Atorvastatin lowered total serum cholesterol by about 1.3 mmol/L compared with placebo at 12 months, and by 1.1 mmol/L after 3 years of follow-up. The reductions in major cardiovascular events with atorvastatin are large, given the short follow-up time. These findings may have implications for future lipid-lowering guidelines.","The ASCOT-LLA study compared atorvastatin with placebo in 10,305 hypertensive Caucasian patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors and a total nonfasting cholesterol of 250 mg/dL (6.5 mmol/L) or less. Patients were aged 40 to 79 years and had at least 3 other cardiovascular risk factors (left ventricular hypertrophy, abnormal electrocardiogram, type 2 diabetes, peripheral artery disease, stroke or transient ischemic attack, male sex, age >55 years, proteinuria or microalbuminuria, smoking, family history of premature coronary heart disease). The study was stopped early at a median of 3.3 years because atorvastatin significantly reduced cardiac events. Atorvastatin also significantly reduced ischemic strokes when compared with placebo (relative risk [RR]=0.73, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.56-0.96; P=.024). This study did not differentiate between first or second stroke. The NNT was 155."
"Does combining aspirin and warfarin decrease the risk of stroke for patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation
The incidence of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation is greatly reduced by oral anticoagulation, with the full effect seen at international normalized ratio (INR) values of 2.0 or greater. The effect of the intensity of oral anticoagulation on the severity of atrial fibrillation-related stroke is not known but is central to the choice of the target INR. We studied incident ischemic strokes in a cohort of 13,559 patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. Strokes were identified through hospitalization data bases and validated on the basis of medical records, which also provided information on the use of warfarin or aspirin, the INR at admission, and coexisting illnesses. The severity of stroke was graded according to a modified Rankin scale. Thirty-day mortality was ascertained from hospitalization and mortality files. Of 596 ischemic strokes, 32 percent occurred during warfarin therapy, 27 percent during aspirin therapy, and 42 percent during neither type of therapy. Among patients who were taking warfarin, an INR of less than 2.0 at admission, as compared with an INR of 2.0 or greater, independently increased the odds of a severe stroke in a proportional-odds logistic-regression model (odds ratio, 1.9; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.1 to 3.4) across three severity categories and the risk of death within 30 days (hazard ratio, 3.4; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.1 to 10.1). An INR of 1.5 to 1.9 at admission was associated with a mortality rate similar to that for an INR of less than 1.5 (18 percent and 15 percent, respectively). The 30-day mortality rate among patients who were taking aspirin at the time of the stroke was similar to that among patients who were taking warfarin and who had an INR of less than 2.0. Among patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, anticoagulation that results in an INR of 2.0 or greater reduces not only the frequency of ischemic stroke but also its severity and the risk of death from stroke. Our findings provide further evidence against the use of lower INR target levels in patients with atrial fibrillation.","The intensity of warfarin therapy and stroke severity has recently been studied for patients with NVAF. A subtherapeutic INR (<2.0) on the day of admission was independently associated with severe stroke (odds ratio=1.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1-3.4), and risk of death at 30 days (hazard ratio, 3.4; 95% CI, 1.1-10.1) compared with an INR of 2.0 or greater. Furthermore, an admission INR of 1.5-1.9 had a similar mortality rate (18%) as an INR of <1.5 (15%), and for those patients on aspirin (15%)."
"Does combining aspirin and warfarin decrease the risk of stroke for patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation
Atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with an increased risk of stroke. Six randomized studies of the use of oral anticoagulation therapy have demonstrated that the relative risk of stroke is decreased by approximately 68%. Three of these studies also compared aspirin with placebo use in a double-blind design. We pooled individual patient data from these 3 studies. To determine if there were subgroups of patients who were particularly responsive to aspirin use and to determine the efficacy of aspirin compared with placebo use in the broad spectrum of patients with AF. There were 1985 patient-years assigned to the aspirin and 1867 patient-years assigned to the placebo groups in the analysis. The daily dose of aspirin was 75 mg in the Atrial Fibrillation, Aspirin, Anticoagulation Study, 325 mg in the Stroke Prevention in Atrial Fibrillation 1 Study, and 300 mg in the European Atrial Fibrillation Trial. The European Atrial Fibrillation Trial was a secondary prevention trial, while the other 2 were primary prevention studies. The primary end point in this analysis was ischemic stroke. At the time of randomization, the patients' mean age was 70 years and the mean blood pressure was 145/83 mm Hg. Sixty-two percent of patients were male, 46% had a history of hypertension, 35% had a previous transient ischemic attack or stroke, and 19% had intermittent AF. Although aspirin use seemed particularly effective in younger patients and in those with hypertension in the Stroke Prevention in Atrial Fibrillation 1 Study, this was not the case in the other studies. No other subgroups particularly responsive to aspirin therapy were identified. When patients from all the studies were combined, the relative risk reduction with aspirin therapy was 21% (95% confidence interval, 0%-38%; P = .05). A subgroup of patients with AF that has a particularly large reduction in stroke incidence from aspirin therapy was not convincingly identified. The data from the combined analysis of these 3 randomized trials suggest a small effect of aspirin use in preventing stroke in patients with AF.","Combined data from the Atrial Fibrillation Aspirin Anticoagulation Study (AFASAK-1), the European Atrial Fibrillation Trial, and the Stroke Prevention in Atrial Fibrillation (SPAF) I studies revealed a small but statistically significant reduction in stroke rates (relative risk reduction [RRR]=21%; 8.1% vs 6.3% annual stroke rate; NNT=55), with no increase in major bleeding risk."
"What is the recommended workup for a man with a first UTI
Bacteriologic criteria for diagnosing urinary tract infections in men have not been well defined. For determination of the bacterial colony count in voided specimens that most accurately reflects bladder bacteriuria, culture results were compared for voided urine and bladder urine (obtained by suprapubic aspiration and urethral catheterization) from men with various genitourinary problems. Bladder bacteriuria was found in 36 (47.3%) of 76 sets of specimens from 66 individuals. Culture results of bladder specimens showed excellent agreement with those of clean-catch midstream-void and uncleansed first-void specimens (weighted kappa = 0.924 and 0.906, respectively). The criterion for clean-catch midstream-void specimens that best differentiated sterile from infected bladder urine was growth of greater than or equal to 10(3) cfu of one predominant species/ml; this definition had a sensitivity of 0.97 and a specificity of 0.97. Uncleansed first-void specimens were equally sensitive (0.97) but less specific (0.91-0.92) in detection of bacteriuria. Pyuria (greater than or equal to leukocytes/mm3) and irritative genitourinary symptoms showed modest correlations with bladder bacteriuria.","A cohort of 66 men (mean age, 66±13 years) presenting to a VA urology clinic for procedures, dysuria, or bacteriuria had urine samples taken while voiding, as well as directly from the bladder, either via suprapubic aspiration or urethral catheterization. Using bladder cultures as a gold standard, midstream urine culture had a specificity and sensitivity of >97% at a threshold of 1000 CFU/mL."
"What is the best initial treatment for orbital cellulitis in children
Subperiosteal abscess may accompany orbital cellulitis secondary to sinusitis. Common surgical principles include incision and drainage of all abscesses. Previous evidence suggests that some orbital abscesses may be treatable with intravenous antibiotics, especially in young children. Children's hospital records were reviewed to determine which abscesses may be treated medically. Records of patients admitted for orbital cellulitis from 1993 to 1996 were reviewed. Patients with subperiosteal abscess on CT scan were included. Clinical outcomes for initial surgical versus medical management of medial abscesses were compared. Differences in age, hospital stay, and intracranial involvement were analyzed for medial versus nonmedial abscesses. All patients had abscesses adjacent to infected sinuses. Eighteen young children had medial abscesses. Twelve of 13 were cured by initial medical treatment; 4 of 5 underwent successful initial drainage. Outcomes were not statistically different (P > .490). Seven children with nonmedial abscesses were older (P < .001) and had more complicated courses than those with medial abscess. Three of 6 children with superior orbital abscess also had intracranial abscess. Intracranial complication was more likely with superior versus medial orbital abscess (P < .01). Medial subperiosteal orbital abscesses secondary to sinusitis in children 6 years of age and younger are highly amenable to treatment with intravenous antibiotics. Older children and children with nonmedial abscesses may have more complicated infections. Children with superior orbital abscesses are at higher risk for intracranial abscess.",No statistically significant long-term difference in subperiosteal abscesses (as a complication of orbital cellulitis) was found in a retrospective study comparing medical to surgical management.
"What is the best initial treatment for orbital cellulitis in children
To determine the appropriate early management of orbital cellulitis and the current bacterial etiology and to evaluate the clinical usefulness of orbital computed tomographic imaging for this infection, a prospective study of orbital cellulitis was conducted during a 2-year period, 1999 to 2000, after the introduction of a conservative medical management plan designed by our pediatric infectious diseases, ophthalmology and otolaryngology services. Basically patients did not have surgical intervention unless progressive involvement of the optic nerve occurred after 24 to 36 h of intravenous antimicrobial therapy. Nine patients had orbital cellulitis and subperiosteal abscesses; only one required surgical drainage because of progressive disease, this case being culture-negative. One had a blood culture positive for Streptococcus pneumoniae; conjunctival cultures showed moderate to heavy growth for S. pneumoniae from this and two other patients, but otherwise bacterial etiology could not be defined. Haemophilus influenzae was not recovered from any of their blood or conjunctival cultures. This experience, during the computed tomography scan and Haemophilus vaccine era, supports an initial medical management approach for most patients with subperiosteal or retrobulbar abscesses resulting in orbital cellulitis.","A small case series (n=9) found 21 children admitted to hospital for preseptal cellulitis, of whom 4 later were diagnosed with orbital cellulitis. There was a total of 9 cases of orbital cellulitis; however, only 1 required operative management of orbital cellulitis."
"What's the best way to screen for anxiety and panic disorders
Many case-finding instruments are available to help primary care physicians (PCPs) diagnose depression, but they are not widely used. Physicians often consider these instruments too time consuming or feel they do not provide sufficient diagnostic information. Our study examined the validity and utility of the Quick PsychoDiagnostics (QPD) Panel, an automated mental health test designed to meet the special needs of PCPs. The test screens for 9 common psychiatric disorders and requires no physician time to administer or score. We evaluated criterion validity relative to the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID), and evaluated convergent validity by correlating QPD Panel scores with established mental health measures. Sensitivity to change was examined by readministering the test to patients pretreatment and posttreatment. Utility was evaluated through physician and patient satisfaction surveys. For major depression, sensitivity and specificity were 81% and 96%, respectively. For other disorders, sensitivities ranged from 69% to 98%, and specificities ranged from 90% to 97%. The depression severity score correlated highly with the Beck, Hamilton, Zung, and CES-D depression scales, and the anxiety score correlated highly with the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and the anxiety subscale of the Symptom Checklist 90 (Ps <.001). The test was sensitive to change. All PCPs agreed or strongly agreed that the QPD Panel ""is convenient and easy to use,"" ""can be used immediately by any physician,"" and ""helps provide better patient care."" Patients also rated the test favorably. The QPD Panel is a valid mental health assessment tool that can diagnose a range of common psychiatric disorders and is practical for routine use in primary care.","The QPD has similar likelihood ratios to the GAD-7, but it requires purchase of proprietary software, and the supporting evidence is based on a small, selected, and compensated study group."

To assess whether menstrual variability predicts time to menopause. Analyses drew on 326 menstruating women, aged 44 to 56, who were followed until they reached menopause or the study ended. The women provided data on their menstrual characteristics at intake. We evaluated the utility of six definitions of menstrual variability for predicting time to ascertained menopause (final menstrual period + 12 months): (1) more than 90 days since the most recent menstrual period (n = 20); (2) 60 or more days of amenorrhea during the previous year (n = 71); (3) cycle lengths that varied by 19 or more days (n = 106); (4) cycle lengths too variable to report a usual length (n = 29); (5) cycles less regular than they had been at age 40 (n = 107); and (6) change in the duration or heaviness of menstrual flow compared with age 40 (n = 255). In addition, we evaluated hot flashes or night sweats during the previous week (n = 50) and age 50 or more years (n = 60) as predictors. Definitions 1 to 5 predicted time to menopause; definition 6 did not. Definition 1 had the highest positive predictive value for ascertained menopause within 2 years and within 4 years; definitions 2 and 4 had low to moderate positive predictive values for ascertained menopause within 2 years but good positive predictive values for ascertained menopause within 4 years. For ascertained menopause within 2 years, definition 2 showed the best balance of sensitivity (94%) and specificity (91%). Simple questions about menstrual variability elicit information that is informative about proximity to menopause.",Change in the amount of flow is more sensitive but less specific (sensitivity=0.81; specificity=0.30; LR+=1.15; LR-=0.65).
"Does a low-fat diet help prevent breast cancer
Animal experiments and human ecological studies suggest that dietary fat intake is associated with a risk of breast cancer, but individual-based studies have given contradictory results. We have carried out a meta-analysis of this association to include all papers published up to July 2003. Case-control and cohort studies that examined the association of dietary fat, or fat-containing foods, with risk of breast cancer were identified. A total of 45 risk estimates for total fat intake were obtained. Descriptive data from each study were extracted with an estimate of relative risk and its associated 95% confidence interval (CI), and were analysed using the random effects model of DerSimonian and Laird. The summary relative risk, comparing the highest and lowest levels of intake of total fat, was 1.13 (95% CI: 1.03-1.25). Cohort studies (N=14) had a summary relative risk of 1.11 (95% CI: 0.99-1.25) and case-control studies (N=31) had a relative risk of 1.14 (95% CI 0.99-1.32). Significant summary relative risks were also found for saturated fat (RR, 1.19; 95% CI: 1.06-1.35) and meat intake (RR, 1.17; 95% CI 1.06-1.29). Combined estimates of risk for total and saturated fat intake, and for meat intake, all indicate an association between higher intakes and an increased risk of breast cancer. Case-control and cohort studies gave similar results.","The meta-analysis performed by Boyd et al did find a statistically significant difference, with relative risks ranging from 1.11 for overall to 1.19 for high-saturated-fat diets. The upper limit of all confidence intervals was no higher than 1.35, however, suggesting a lack of clinical significance."
"Does a low-fat diet help prevent breast cancer
Preclinical and observational studies suggest a relationship between dietary fat intake and breast cancer, but the association remains controversial. We carried out a randomized, prospective, multicenter clinical trial to test the effect of a dietary intervention designed to reduce fat intake in women with resected, early-stage breast cancer receiving conventional cancer management. A total of 2437 women were randomly assigned between February 1994 and January 2001 in a ratio of 40:60 to dietary intervention (n = 975) or control (n = 1462) groups. An interim analysis was performed after a median follow-up of 60 months when funding for the intervention ceased. Mean differences between dietary intervention and control groups in nutrient intakes and anthropometric variables were compared with t tests. Relapse-free survival was examined using Kaplan-Meier analysis, stratified log-rank tests, and Cox proportional hazards models. Statistical tests were two-sided. Dietary fat intake was lower in the intervention than in the control group (fat grams/day at 12 months, 33.3 [95% confidence interval {CI} = 32.2 to 34.5] versus 51.3 [95% CI = 50.0 to 52.7], respectively; P<.001), corresponding to a statistically significant (P = .005), 6-pound lower mean body weight in the intervention group. A total of 277 relapse events (local, regional, distant, or ipsilateral breast cancer recurrence or new contralateral breast cancer) have been reported in 96 of 975 (9.8%) women in the dietary group and 181 of 1462 (12.4%) women in the control group. The hazard ratio of relapse events in the intervention group compared with the control group was 0.76 (95% CI = 0.60 to 0.98, P = .077 for stratified log rank and P = .034 for adjusted Cox model analysis). Exploratory analyses suggested a differential effect of the dietary intervention based on hormonal receptor status. A lifestyle intervention reducing dietary fat intake, with modest influence on body weight, may improve relapse-free survival of breast cancer patients receiving conventional cancer management. Longer, ongoing nonintervention follow-up will address original protocol design plans, which called for 3 years of follow-up after completion of recruitment.","Recently, a nested study within the Women's Intervention Nutrition Study did show that women with breast cancer who decreased their fat intake to a median of 33 g/day had a hazard ratio of 0.76 for relapse over 60 months (compared with controls who ate a median of 51 g/day)."
"What is the best way to manage benign paroxysmal positional vertigo
Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is a syndrome characterised by short-lived episodes of vertigo in association with rapid changes in head position. It is a common cause of vertigo presenting to primary care and specialist otolaryngology clinics. Current treatment approaches include rehabilitative exercises and physical manoeuvres including the Epley manoeuvre. To assess the effectiveness of the Epley manoeuvre compared to other treatments available for posterior canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, or no treatment. The Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (Cochrane Library, Issue 2 2001), MEDLINE (1966 onwards), EMBASE (1974 onwards), and reference lists of identified publications. Date of the most recent search was June 2001. Randomised trials of adults diagnosed with posterior canal BPPV (including a positive Dix-Hallpike test). Comparisons sought: - Epley manoeuvre versus placebo. - Epley manoeuvre versus untreated controls. Epley manoeuvre versus other active treatment. Outcome measures that were considered include: frequency and severity of attacks of vertigo; proportion of patients improved by each intervention; and conversion of a ""positive"" Dix-Hallpike test to a ""negative"" Dix-Hallpike test Both reviewers independently extracted data and assessed trials for quality. Eleven trials were identified but nine studies were excluded because of a high risk of bias, leaving two trials in the review. Trials were mainly excluded because of inadequate concealment during randomisation, or failure to blind outcome assessors. Both studies included in the review (Lynn 1995, Froehling 2000) addressed the efficacy of the Epley manoeuvre against a sham manoeuvre by comparing the proportion of subjects in each group who had complete resolution of their symptoms, and who converted from a positive to negative Dix-Hallpike test. Individual and pooled data showed a statistically significant effect in favour of the Epley manoeuvre over controls. There were no serious adverse effects of treatment. ~bullet~There is some evidence that the Epley manoeuvre is a safe effective treatment for posterior canal BPPV, although this is based on the results of only two small randomised controlled trials with relatively short follow up. ~bullet~There is no good evidence that the Epley manoeuvre provides a long term resolution of symptoms. ~bullet~There is no good evidence comparing the Epley manoeuvre with other physical, medical or surgical therapy for posterior canal BPPV.","A Cochrane review of treatments for BPPV yielded 11 trials, of which 9 were excluded due to a high risk of bias."
"What is the best hypnotic for use in the elderly
Patients with insomnia may experience one or more of the following problems: difficulty falling asleep, difficulty maintaining sleep, waking up too early in the morning and nonrefreshing sleep. In addition, daytime consequences such as fatigue, lack of energy, difficulty concentrating and irritability are often present. Approximately 10 percent of adults experience persistent insomnia, although most patients do not mention it during routine office visits. Asking sleep-related questions during the general review of systems and asking patients with sleep complaints to keep a sleep diary are helpful approaches in detecting insomnia. Behavior and pharmacologic therapies are used in treating insomnia. Behavior approaches take a few weeks to improve sleep but continue to provide relief even after training sessions have ended. Hypnotic medications are safe and effective in inducing, maintaining and consolidating sleep. Effective treatment of insomnia may improve the quality of life for many patients.",Chloral hydrate has a narrow therapeutic index and is not recommended for the treatment of insomnia.
"What is the best hypnotic for use in the elderly
Insomnia affects 30-35% of people living in developed countries. The impact of insomnia on daytime functioning and its relationship with medical and psychiatric illnesses necessitate early treatment to prevent insomnia becoming persistent and to avoid the development of complications. However, pharmacological strategies must achieve a balance between sedative and adverse effects. In the last 30 years, benzodiazepines have been the preferred drugs for the treatment of insomnia. Benzodiazepines act nonselectively at two central receptor sites, named omega(1) and omega(2), which are located in different areas of the CNS. The sedative action of benzodiazepines is related to omega(1) receptors, whereas omega(2) receptors are responsible for their effects on memory and cognitive functioning. According to their pharmacokinetic profile, benzodiazepines can be classified into three groups: short half-life (<3 hours), medium half-life (8-24 hours) and long half-life (>24 hours). The newer non-benzodiazepine agents zopiclone, zolpidem and zaleplon have a hypnosedative action comparable with that of benzodiazepines, but they display specific pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. These three 'Z' agents all share a short plasma half-life and limited duration of action. In addition, these agents are selective compounds that interact preferentially with omega(1) receptors (sedative effect), whereas benzodiazepines also interact with omega(2) receptors (adverse effects on cognitive performance and memory). Zaleplon is characterised by an ultrashort half-life (approximately 1 hour). Zolpidem and zopiclone have longer half-lives (approximately 2.4 and 5 hours, respectively). These properties, together with the low risk of residual effect, may explain the limited negative influences of these agents on daytime performance. Psychomotor tasks and memory capacities appear to be better preserved by non-benzodiazepine agents than by benzodiazepines. When present, cognitive deficits almost exclusively coincide with the peak plasma concentration. In particular, impairment can emerge in the first hours after drug administration, whereas psychomotor and memory tests carried out 7-8 hours later (i.e. in the morning) generally show no relevant alterations. As with benzodiazepines, the three 'Z' non-benzodiazepine agents should be used for a limited period, even in chronic relapsing conditions. Further evaluation is needed of the safety of hypnosedative medications in the long-term management of insomnia.",Zolpidem and zaleplon differ structurally from benzodiazepines but act at the benzodiazepine receptor.
"Do statins cause myopathy
To review rhabdomyolysis and discuss the role of hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) and their interactions with other agents in precipitating this condition, and to present case reports of statin-induced rhabdomyolysis. Relevant clinical literature was accessed using MEDLINE (January 1985-October 2000). The following search terms were used: rhabdomyolysis, adverse events, drug interactions, statins, and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. Rhabdomyolysis occurs when extensive muscle damage results in the release of cellular contents into systemic circulation. Major complications include acute renal failure, cardiac abnormalities, and compartment syndrome. Treatment of rhabdomyolysis is supportive, with the primary aim of preventing renal and cardiac complications. Statin monotherapy or combination therapy may result in myopathy, which rarely progresses to rhabdomyolysis. The mechanism for drug interactions with the statins involves their property of lipid or water solubility. This characteristic determines the degree of hepatoenteric or renal metabolism of the statins. All statins except pravastatin undergo metabolism via the cytochrome P450 enzyme system. Other pharmacologic agents that are also metabolized via this pathway may interact with the statins and cause rhabdomyolysis. The risk of statin-induced rhabdomyolysis is increased significantly when statins are used concomitantly with such drugs as fibrates, cyclosporine, macrolide antibiotics, and azole antifungals. Rhabdomyolysis is a rare but clinically important adverse event of statin monotherapy or combination therapy. Thorough understanding of this condition may help prevent or minimize adverse health outcomes in patents receiving statin therapy.","It is unknown whether previous myopathy, however defined, increases the risk of future myopathy with statin rechallenge. A tabular analysis of 74 published case reports of statin-associated rhabdomyolysis from a MEDLINE search covering 1985 to 2000 reported that in most cases the statin was safely restarted after stopping presumed interactive drugs (exact numbers not reported)."
"Do statins cause myopathy
This study presents the long-term safety data from AFCAPS/TexCAPS, the first primary prevention trial to demonstrate that men and women with average levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and below average levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) can significantly benefit from long-term treatment to lower LDL-C; lovastatin 20 to 40 mg/day reduced the risk of a first acute major coronary event (fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction, unstable angina, or sudden death) by 37% (p = 0.00008). This double-blind randomized, placebo-controlled trial, in 6,605 generally healthy middle-aged and older men and women, had prespecified end point and cancer analyses. All analyses were intention-to-treat. Safety monitoring included history, physical examination, and laboratory studies (including hepatic transaminases and creatine phosphokinase [CPK]). All participants, even those who discontinued treatment, were contacted annually for vital status, cardiovascular events, and cancer history. After an average of 5.2 years of follow-up, there were 157 deaths (80 receiving lovastatin and 77 receiving placebo; relative risk [RR] 1.04; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.76 to 1.42; p = 0.82); of which 115 were noncardiovascular (RR 1.21; CI 0.84 to 1.74; p = 0.31), and of these, 82 were due to cancer (RR 1.41; CI 0.91 to 2.19; p = 0.13). There were no significant differences between treatment groups in overall cancer rates, discontinuations for noncardiovascular adverse experiences, or clinically important elevations of hepatic transaminases or CPK. Among those who used cytochrome P450 isoform (CYP3A4) inhibitors, there were no treatment group differences in the frequency of clinically important muscle-related adverse events. Treatment with lovastatin 20 to 40 mg daily for primary prevention of coronary heart disease was well tolerated and reduced the risk of first acute coronary events without increasing the risk of either noncardiovascular mortality or cancer.","In the AFCAPS/TexCAPS trial, 20 of 21 statin patients (out of a study population of 3304) who had elevated creatine kinase (>10 times the upper limits of normal) recovered with continued lovastatin treatment, while the other patient resumed treatment after a brief interruption without further elevations."
"Should you use steroids to treat infectious mononucleosis
To evaluate the efficacy of a single oral dose of dexamethasone for pain relief in acute exudative pharyngitis associated with infectious mononucleosis. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pediatric emergency department-based clinical trial. Patients aged between 8 and 18 years with a sore throat from clinically suspected infectious mononucleosis were eligible. Patients were randomized to receive either an oral dose of 0.3 mg/kg (maximum, 15 mg) of dexamethasone or a placebo. Patients completed a diary of symptoms and rated their pain on a visual analog scale from 0 to 100 mm at 0 hours, 12 hours, 24 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours, and on day 7. An improvement of 20 mm from baseline on the visual analog scale was evaluated as the primary end point. Twenty patients were recruited in each group; mean +/- SD age was 13.5 +/- 2.8 years. In comparison with the placebo group, a significantly greater proportion of patients given dexamethasone achieved pain relief within the first 12 hours (12/20 vs 5/19; P =.03). On further follow-up, the proportions achieving pain relief were similar between groups: 11 of 20 vs 6 of 20 at 24 hours (P =.10); 11 of 20 vs 11 of 20 at 48 hours (P>.99); 15 of 20 vs 15 of 19 at 72 hours (P =.93); and 18 of 19 vs 19 of 20 at day 7 (P>.99), with dexamethasone vs placebo, respectively. The short-lived relief of pain in acute exudative pharyngitis in children with suspected infectious mononucleosis may suggest that a single oral dose of dexamethasone may not be sufficient and that additional doses may be necessary for ensuring lasting relief.","A study reported that 3 patients experienced adverse events, including dehydration and severe pharyngitis."
"What levels of cholesterol should be treated for primary prevention
In a randomized, double-blind five-year trial, we tested the efficacy of simultaneously elevating serum levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and lowering levels of non-HDL cholesterol with gemfibrozil in reducing the risk of coronary heart disease in 4081 asymptomatic middle-aged men (40 to 55 years of age) with primary dyslipidemia (non-HDL cholesterol greater than or equal to 200 mg per deciliter [5.2 mmol per liter] in two consecutive pretreatment measurements). One group (2051 men) received 600 mg of gemfibrozil twice daily, and the other (2030 men) received placebo. Gemfibrozil caused a marked increase in HDL cholesterol and persistent reductions in serum levels of total, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and non-HDL cholesterol and triglycerides. There were minimal changes in serum lipid levels in the placebo group. The cumulative rate of cardiac end points at five years was 27.3 per 1,000 in the gemfibrozil group and 41.4 per 1,000 in the placebo group--a reduction of 34.0 percent in the incidence of coronary heart disease (95 percent confidence interval, 8.2 to 52.6; P less than 0.02; two-tailed test). The decline in incidence in the gemfibrozil group became evident in the second year and continued throughout the study. There was no difference between the groups in the total death rate, nor did the treatment influence the cancer rates. The results are in accord with two previous trials with different pharmacologic agents and indicate that modification of lipoprotein levels with gemfibrozil reduces the incidence of coronary heart disease in men with dyslipidemia.",Results of studies of the fibric acid derivatives are mixed. Subjects taking gemfibrozil 1200 mg per day in the 5-year Helsinki Heart Study had fewer coronary events compared with those taking a placebo (NNT = 71).
"What's the best way to treat Achilles tendonopathy
Achilles tendinitis is one of the most common of all sports injuries. There is no consensus on treatment. To assess the effectiveness of various treatment interventions for acute and chronic Achilles tendinitis in adults. The Cochrane Musculoskeletal Injuries Group specialised register (December 2000), Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (The Cochrane Library Issue 4, 2000), MEDLINE (1966 to December 2000), EMBASE (1980 to 2001 wk 04), CINAHL (1982 to December 2000), and reference lists of identified trials were searched. Randomised or quasi-randomised trials of treatment interventions for acute and chronic Achilles tendinitis in adults. Studies focusing on pathological tendinitis were excluded. Excluded were those trials that compared different dosages of the same drug or drugs within the same class of drugs, for example different non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Three reviewers independently assessed trial quality, by use of a ten item check list, and extracted data. Requests were sent for separate data for Achilles tendinitis patients in studies within trials of mixed patient populations. Where possible, quantitative analysis and limited pooling of data were undertaken. Nine trials, involving 697 patients, met the inclusion criteria of the review. Methodological quality was adequate in most of the trials with regards to blinding but the assessment of outcome was incomplete and short-term. There was weak but not robust evidence from three trials of a modest benefit of NSAIDs for the alleviation of acute symptoms. There was some weak evidence of no difference compared with no treatment of low dose heparin, heel pads, topical laser therapy and peritendonous steroid injection, but this could not be fully evaluated from the reports of four trials. The results of an experimental preparation of a calf-derived deproteinized haemodialysate, Actovegin, were promising but the severity of patient symptoms was questionable in the single small trial testing this comparison. The results of a comparison of glycosaminoglycan sulfate with a NSAID were inconclusive. There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to determine which method of treatment is the most appropriate for the treatment of acute or chronic Achilles tendinitis. Further research is warranted.","A Cochrane review of treatments for acute Achilles tendonopathy included 9 randomized trials with a total of 697 patients. Two RCTs showed evidence that NSAIDs alleviate acute symptoms. In 1 trial of 212 patients who received an oral NSAID or placebo for 14 days, significantly fewer patients in the placebo group achieved a good or excellent symptom relief (relative risk [RR]=0.42; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.21-0.86). A second RCT of 243 patients compared treatment with a topical NSAID to placebo for 21 days; significantly fewer participants who took placebo returned to their pre-injury level of activity (RR=0.78; 95% CI, 0.63-0.95). Low-dose heparin injection, heel pads, topical laser therapy, and peritendinous steroid injection produced no significant decrease in pain compared with placebo."

"How should you evaluate elevated calcium in an asymptomatic patient
Hypercalcemia is a disorder commonly encountered by primary care physicians. The diagnosis often is made incidentally in asymptomatic patients. Clinical manifestations affect the neuromuscular, gastrointestinal, renal, skeletal, and cardiovascular systems. The most common causes of hypercalcemia are primary hyperparathyroidism and malignancy. Some other important causes of hypercalcemia are medications and familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia. An initial diagnostic work-up should include measurement of intact parathyroid hormone, and any medications that are likely to be causative should be discontinued. Parathyroid hormone is suppressed in malignancy-associated hypercalcemia and elevated in primary hyperparathyroidism. It is essential to exclude other causes before considering parathyroid surgery, and patients should be referred for parathyroidectomy only if they meet certain criteria. Many patients with primary hyperparathyroidism have a benign course and do not need surgery. Hypercalcemic crisis is a life-threatening emergency. Aggressive intravenous rehydration is the mainstay of management in severe hypercalcemia, and antiresorptive agents, such as calcitonin and bisphosphonates, frequently can alleviate the clinical manifestations of hypercalcemic disorders.","To determine the level, use the equation [4.0 - (plasma albumin)] x 0.8 + (serum calcium) or measure serum ionized calcium. Normal levels of serum ionized calcium for adults older than 19 years are 1.13 to 1.32 mmol/L, although the exact range can vary from laboratory to laboratory. Elevated physiologically active calcium indicates true hypercalcemia."

"How should you evaluate elevated calcium in an asymptomatic patient
Parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP) is the predominant cause of malignancy-associated hypercalcemia. However, its prognostic utility is unclear. We aimed to determine the prognostic value of serum PTHrP levels in patients who had hypercalcemia associated with malignancy. In this prospective case series, we evaluated 76 patients with a diagnosis of cancer and hypercalcemia (serum calcium level >/=10.3 mg/dL on at least two occasions). PTHrP levels >/=1 pmol/L were considered elevated. We used multivariate Cox regression analysis to identify factors associated with mortality. Fifty patients (66%) died during follow-up. In a multivariate analysis, higher pretreatment calcium levels and elevated PTHrP levels were associated with increased mortality, with effects of PTHrP varying by age (P = 0.03). Survival was associated with pretreatment calcium levels both in patients over 65 years of age (hazard ratio [HR] per mg/dL = 1.5; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.2 to 1.8; P <0.001) and in patients aged 65 years or less (HR = 1.3; 95% CI: 1.1 to 1.5; P = 0.003). Adjusted for pretreatment calcium levels, elevated PTHrP levels were associated with increased mortality in patients aged </=65 years (HR = 3.8; 95% CI: 1.6 to 8.8; P = 0.002), but not in older patients (HR = 0.7; 95% CI: 0.3 to 1.9; P = 0.51). PTHrP is a useful prognostic factor in malignancy-associated hypercalcemia, at least in patients aged </=65 years.","In a prospective case series of patients with hypercalcemia and malignancy, 54% had elevated PTHrP levels. The authors found that an elevated PTHrP in patients younger than 65 years of age doubles the risk of death from malignancy compared to patients the same age with normal PTHrP (hazard ratio=1.9; 95% CI, 1.1-3.4)."
"Is there much risk in using fluoroquinolones in children
Quinolone-induced arthropathic toxicity in weight-bearing joints observed in juvenile animals during preclinical testing has largely restricted the routine use of ciprofloxacin in the pediatric age group. As histopathologic, radiologic and magnetic resonance imaging monitoring evidence has gathered supporting the safety of fluoroquinolones in children, many pediatricians have started to prescribe quinolones to some patients on a compassionate basis. The objective of this study was to ascertain the safety of ciprofloxacin in preterm neonates <33 weeks gestational age treated at Dhaka Shishu (Children) Hospital in Bangladesh. Long-term follow up was done to monitor the growth and development of preterm infants who were administered intravenous ciprofloxacin in the neonatal period. Ciprofloxacin was used only as a life-saving therapy in cases of sepsis produced by bacterial agents resistant to other antibiotics. Another group of preterm neonates with septicemia who were not exposed to ciprofloxacin, but effectively treated with other antibiotics and followed up, were matched with cases for gender, gestational age and birth weight and included as a comparison group. Forty-eight patients in the ciprofloxacin group and 66 patients in the comparison group were followed up for a mean of 24.7 +/- 18.5 months and 21.6 +/- 18.8 months, respectively. No osteoarticular problems or joint deformities were observed in the ciprofloxacin group during treatment or follow up. No differences in growth and development between the groups were found. Ciprofloxacin is a safe therapeutic option for newborns with sepsis produced by multiply resistant organisms.","A prospective study published in 2006 monitored joint toxicities (swelling, tenderness, or restricted movement) during acute treatment with ciprofloxacin as well as skeletal growth at follow-up based on physical examination. Preterm neonates with septicemia were treated with either ciprofloxacin (n=48) or other antibiotics (n=66). Forty infants in the ciprofloxacin group completed an average of 28 months of follow-up. No complaints or physical findings of osteoarticular joint abnormalities or skeletal growth delay were noted in either group during acute treatment or at follow-up. The incidence of tendonopathy was not reported."
"Do any folk remedies or herbals help induce labor
Breast stimulation has been suggested as a means of inducing labour. It is a non-medical intervention allowing women greater control over the induction process. This is one of a series of reviews of methods of cervical ripening and labour induction using a standardised methodology. To determine the effectiveness of breast stimulation for third trimester cervical ripening or induction of labour in comparison with placebo/no intervention or other methods of induction of labour. The Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group Trials Register (March 2004) and bibliographies of relevant papers. Clinical trials of breast stimulation for third trimester cervical ripening or labour induction. A strategy was developed to deal with the large volume and complexity of trial data relating to labour induction. This involved a two-stage method of data extraction. Six trials (719 women) were included. Analysis of trials comparing breast stimulation with no intervention found a significant reduction in the number of women not in labour at 72 hours (62.7% versus 93.6%, relative risk (RR) 0.67, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.60 to 0.74). This result was not significant in women with an unfavourable cervix. A major reduction in the rate of postpartum haemorrhage was reported (0.7% versus 6%, RR 0.16, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.87). No significant difference was detected in the caesarean section rate (9% versus 10%, RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.38 to 2.12) or rates of meconium staining. There were no instances of uterine hyperstimulation. Three perinatal deaths were reported (1.8% versus 0%, RR 8.17, 95% CI 0.45 to 147.77). When comparing breast stimulation with oxytocin alone the analysis found no difference in caesarean section rates (28% versus 47%, RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.18). No difference was detected in the number of women not in labour after 72 hours (58.8% versus 25%, RR 2.35, 95% CI 1.00 to 5.54) or rates of meconium staining. There were four perinatal deaths (17.6% versus 5%, RR 3.53, 95% CI 0.40 to 30.88). Breast stimulation appears beneficial in relation to the number of women not in labour after 72 hours, and reduced postpartum haemorrhage rates. Until safety issues have been fully evaluated it should not be used in high-risk women. Further research is required to evaluate its safety, and should seek data on postpartum haemorrhage rates, number of women not in labour at 72 hours and maternal satisfaction.","A systematic review of 6 trials with a total of 719 participants compared unilateral breast stimulation with no intervention to induce labor in women at term. In 2 trials, the 300 participants stimulated 1 breast for 1 hour a day for 3 days; in the other 4 trials, 419 women stimulated either breast alternately for 3 hours a day. Breast stimulation significantly reduced the number of women who hadn't gone into labor at 72 hours compared with nonintervention (62.7% vs 93.6%; relative risk [RR]=0.67; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.60-0.74; number needed to treat [NNT]=3.2). This result remained significant when primiparous and multiparous women were analyzed separately, but not in the 1 trial (37 participants) that reported on women with an unfavorable cervix. Breast stimulation also reduced postpartum hemorrhage (0.7% vs 6%; RR=0.16; 95% CI, 0.03-0.87; NNT=18.8). None of the trials documented uterine hyperstimulation or meconium-stained fluid, and they didn't find significant differences in the rates of cesarean section (9% vs 10%; RR=0.90; 95% CI, 0.38-2.12). One trial reported 4 perinatal deaths in a high-risk population-3 in the breast stimulation group and 1 in the control group-but this finding was not replicated in any other trials."
"Do any folk remedies or herbals help induce labor
Castor oil, a potent cathartic, is derived from the bean of the castor plant. Anecdotal reports, which date back to ancient Egypt have suggested the use of castor oil to stimulate labour. Castor oil has been widely used as a traditional method of initiating labour in midwifery practice. Its role in the initiation of labour is poorly understood and data examining its efficacy within a clinical trial are limited. This is one of a series of reviews of methods of cervical ripening and labour induction using standardised methodology. To determine the effects of castor oil or enemas for third trimester cervical ripening or induction of labour in comparison with other methods of cervical ripening or induction of labour. The Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group trials register, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register and bibliographies of relevant papers. Last searched: November 2000. (1) clinical trials comparing castor oil, bath or enemas used for third trimester cervical ripening or labour induction with placebo/no treatment or other methods listed above it on a predefined list of labour induction methods; (2) random allocation to the treatment or control group; (3) adequate allocation concealment; (4) violations of allocated management not sufficient to materially affect conclusions; (5) clinically meaningful outcome measures reported; (6) data available for analysis according to the random allocation; (7) missing data insufficient to materially affect the conclusions. A strategy has been developed to deal with the large volume and complexity of trial data relating to labour induction. This involves a two-stage method of data extraction. In the one included study of 100 women, which compared a single dose of castor oil versus no treatment, no difference was found between caesarean section rates (relative risk (RR) 2.31, 95% CI 0.77, 6.87). No data were presented on neonatal or maternal mortality or morbidity. There was no difference between either the rate of meconium stained liquor (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.25,2.36) or Apgar score < 7 at 5 minutes (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.02,45.71) between the two groups. The number of participants was small hence only large differences in outcomes could have been detected. All women who ingested castor oil felt nauseous. The only trial included in this review attempts to address the role of castor oil as an induction agent. The trial was small and of poor methodological quality. Further research is needed to attempt to quantify the efficacy of castor oil as an induction agent.","A Cochrane systematic review included 1 study of women at term with intact membranes who received 1 dose of castor oil to induce labor (n=52) compared with no treatment (n=48). All women who received castor oil felt nauseous, but no other differences were noted between the castor oil group and controls in rates of cesarean section, meconium-stained fluid, or Apgar scores less than 7 at 5 minutes."
"When should acute nonvenereal conjunctivitis be treated with topical antibiotics
Conjunctivitis refers to any inflammatory condition of the membrane that lines the eyelids and covers the exposed surface of the sclera. It is the most common cause of ""red eye"". The etiology can usually be determined by a careful history and an ocular examination, but culture is occasionally necessary to establish the diagnosis or to guide therapy. Conjunctivitis is commonly caused by bacteria and viruses. Neisseria infection should be suspected when severe, bilateral, purulent conjunctivitis is present in a sexually active adult or in a neonate three to five days postpartum. Conjunctivitis caused by Chlamydia trachomatis or Neisseria gonorrhoeae requires aggressive antibiotic therapy, but conjunctivitis due to other bacteria is usually self-limited. Chronic conjunctivitis is usually associated with blepharitis, recurrent styes or meibomianitis. Treatment requires good eyelid hygiene and the application of topical antibiotics as determined by culture. Allergic conjunctivitis is distinguished by severe itching and allergen exposure. This condition is generally treated with topical antihistamines, mast-cell stabilizers or anti-inflammatory agents.","Overall, this evidence suggests that for adults, watchful waiting rather than initially treating with antibiotics is reasonable, given the self-limited nature and lack of serious outcomes in untreated patients as well as growing concern about antibiotic resistance. Note that this recommendation applies only to acute nonvenereal conjunctivitis. It is generally accepted that conjunctivitis caused by gonococcus or chlamydia should be suspected in all newborns and in severe cases in sexually active young adults. These cases warrant culturing and antibiotic treatment to prevent serious complications."
"When should acute nonvenereal conjunctivitis be treated with topical antibiotics
There are concerns regarding whether antibiotic therapy confers significant benefit in the treatment of acute bacterial conjunctivitis. The aim of this review is to assess the benefit and harm of antibiotic therapy in the management of acute bacterial conjunctivitis. We searched the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group specialised register, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register - Central, MEDLINE and the reference lists of identified trial reports. We used the Science Citation Index to look for articles that cited the relevant studies, and we contacted investigators and pharmaceutical companies for information about additional trials. The most recent searches were carried out in September 1998. We included double masked randomised controlled trials in which any form of antibiotic treatment had been compared with placebo in the management of acute bacterial conjunctivitis. This included topical, systemic and combination (for example, antibiotics and steroids) antibiotic usage. One reviewer extracted data and the accuracy was checked by a second reviewer. Relative risks were summarised. We tested for heterogeneity between studies. Six published trials were identified of which three fulfilled the eligibility criteria for inclusion in this review. One trial was single masked and therefore excluded. A second report, when translated, was found to have no placebo group and was therefore excluded. One trial is currently 'awaiting assessment'. This has been published in abstract form and has yet to be fully reported. All the trials thus far identified appear to have been conducted on a selected specialist care patient population. The trials were heterogeneous in terms of their inclusion and exclusion criteria, the nature of the intervention, and the outcome measures assessed. Meta-analysis indicates that acute bacterial conjunctivitis is frequently a self-limiting condition, as clinical remission (cure or significant improvement) occurred by days two to five in 64% (95% confidence interval (CI) 57% to 71%) of those treated with placebo. Treatment with antibiotics was, however, associated with significantly better rates of clinical remission (days two to five: relative risk (RR) 1.31 95% CI 1.11 to 1.55, NNT=5) with a suggestion that this benefit was maintained for late clinical remission (days six to 10: RR 1.27 95% CI 1.00 to 1.61, NNT=5). Antibiotic treatment was associated with rates of microbiological remission (pathogen eradication or reduction). No serious outcomes were reported in either the active or placebo arms of these trials, indicating that important sight-threatening complications are an infrequent occurrence. Acute bacterial conjunctivitis is frequently a self-limiting condition but the use of antibiotics is associated with significantly improved rates of early clinical remission and early and late microbiological remission. Since trials to-date have been conducted in selected specialist care patient populations these results may not necessarily be generalisable to a primary care based population. A trial based in primary care designed to assess the cost-effectiveness of commonly prescribed antibiotic(s) versus placebo in acute bacterial conjunctivitis is warranted.","Although there is a small risk of complications and longer time course when bacterial conjunctivitis is left untreated, the disease is often self-limited, with a 64% clinical remission rate in patients treated for 2 to 5 days with placebo."

"What is the most effective treatment for external genital warts
To evaluate and compare the efficacy and adverse effects of trichloracetic acid and cryotherapy (using liquid nitrogen) in the treatment of external genital warts. Eighty-six patients were enrolled into a randomized clinical trial in the Genitourinary Medicine Department of the Coventry and Warwickshire Hospital (Coventry) between November 1990 and June 1991. External genital warts were treated with either trichloracetic acid or cryotherapy (using liquid nitrogen) on a once weekly basis. They received up to six treatments of either therapy. Complete clearance of warts in patients who received up to six treatments of cryotherapy were observed in 86% of cases and in 70% of patients who received up to six treatments of trichloracetic acid. Thirty percent of patients who were treated with trichloracetic acid developed ulcerations at the site of its application. In this study we found that cryotherapy (using liquid nitrogen) is more effective than that of trichloracetic acid for the treatment of external genital warts. It is also less likely to cause ulceration.","Cryotherapy is equivalent to trichloroacetic acid. This trial showed recurrence in 22% of participants receiving electrosurgery, in 21% of those receiving cryotherapy, and in 44% of those receiving podophyllin treatment. Data are lacking on recurrence rates with imiquimod, podofilox, and intralesional interferon."
"How do you evaluate macrocytosis without anemia
Adult patients with macrocytosis, defined as a mean corpuscular volume (MCV) greater than 100 femtoliters, were studied to assess the importance of an elevated MCV. After eliminating pregnant and postpartum patients and patients receiving medications known to cause macrocytosis (e.g., phenytoin, zidovudine, and chemotherapeutic agents), 80 patients were identified and studied. Sixty-seven diagnoses were made in 56 patients. These diagnoses were, in descending order: alcoholism, hematological disorders, habitual drinking, B12 deficiency, chronic liver disease, folic acid deficiency, hypothyroidism, anorexia nervosa, and reticulocytosis. While an elevated MCV is neither sensitive nor specific for any one disease state, an elevated MCV should raise suspicions of underlying pathology.","Liver disease-which may be confounded by alcohol abuse, medications, or cancer-is a common cause of macrocytosis."
"How do you evaluate macrocytosis without anemia
One hundred and twenty-four patients over the age of 75 years were assessed for the cause of their macrocytosis (MCV > 95 fl). A definitive diagnosis was reached in 75/124 (60%) by non-invasive techniques. The remainder underwent a bone marrow biopsy yielding a definitive diagnosis in a further six patients who had an identifiable myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). A high proportion of the remainder had morphological abnormalities which fitted with no recognized pathological entity. It is suggested that these may represent MDS in evolution.","Hypothyroidism is rarely a cause, but may be more prevalent in the elderly."

"What common substances can cause false positives on urine screens for drugs of abuse
This manuscript reviews data available in the scientific literature relative to drug testing for the five mandated drug classes and circumstances other than abuse of the drug itself that could result in a positive test. For marijuana, passive inhalation, unknowing oral ingestion, and the use of Marinol are discussed. Data are presented on the concentration of delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and its precursors, acid-A and acid-B, in illicit marijuana and the extent of extraction of THC in boiled (tea) or cooked products. For cocaine, passive inhalation and passive exposure issues are reviewed. For opiates, poppy seed ingestion and guidelines for exclusion of poppy seeds as a cause for a positive test are discussed. For amphetamines, issues such as the presence of other phenethylamines, l-methamphetamine (Vicks' inhalers), and other prescription drugs are discussed. Although passive inhalation of methamphetamine and phencyclidine is theoretically possible, no data were available on these issues.","In one study, 6 volunteers in an 8x8x7-ft enclosed room were exposed to 200 mg freebase cocaine vapor; none of their urine samples exceeded the federal GC-MS threshold.

"What is the best regimen for newly diagnosed hypertension
Blood pressure reduction achieved with beta-blockers and diuretics is the best recorded intervention to date for prevention of cardiovascular morbidity and death in patients with hypertension. Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is a strong independent indicator of risk of cardiovascular morbidity and death. We aimed to establish whether selective blocking of angiotensin II improves LVH beyond reducing blood pressure and, consequently, reduces cardiovascular morbidity and death. We did a double-masked, randomised, parallel-group trial in 9193 participants aged 55-80 years with essential hypertension (sitting blood pressure 160-200/95-115 mm Hg) and LVH ascertained by electrocardiography (ECG). We assigned participants once daily losartan-based or atenolol-based antihypertensive treatment for at least 4 years and until 1040 patients had a primary cardiovascular event (death, myocardial infarction, or stroke). We used Cox regression analysis to compare regimens. Blood pressure fell by 30.2/16.6 (SD 18.5/10.1) and 29.1/16.8 mm Hg (19.2/10.1) in the losartan and atenolol groups, respectively. The primary composite endpoint occurred in 508 losartan (23.8 per 1000 patient-years) and 588 atenolol patients (27.9 per 1000 patient-years; relative risk 0.87, 95% CI 0.77-0.98, p=0.021). 204 losartan and 234 atenolol patients died from cardiovascular disease (0.89, 0.73-1.07, p=0.206); 232 and 309, respectively, had fatal or non-fatal stroke (0.75, 0.63-0.89, p=0.001); and myocardial infarction (non-fatal and fatal) occurred in 198 and 188, respectively (1.07, 0.88-1.31, p=0.491). New-onset diabetes was less frequent with losartan. Interpretation Losartan prevents more cardiovascular morbidity and death than atenolol for a similar reduction in blood pressure and is better tolerated. Losartan seems to confer benefits beyond reduction in blood pressure.","A long-term trial has compared an ARB to other types of drug therapy: losartan vs atenolol in the Losartan Intervention for Endpoint Reduction (LIFE) trial. In the LIFE trial, the primary composite endpoint of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, and stroke was less with losartan than atenolol (23.8 vs 27.9 events per 1000 patient-years, losartan and atenolol, respectively; number needed to treat=243 people-years, P=.021)."
"How effective are pharmacologic agents for alcoholism
Primary care physicians are frequently involved in the longitudinal care of patients with alcohol problems and in helping patients to decrease their alcohol consumption. Recent clinical trials provide evidence in support of new treatment strategies for these patients. Brief interventions have been used successfully to reduce alcohol consumption in patients with hazardous and harmful drinking. Twelve-step facilitation, cognitive behavioral, and motivational enhancement therapies have produced sustained drinking reductions in patients with alcohol dependence. Pharmacologic therapies, such as naltrexone and acamprosate, have been effective in decreasing alcohol consumption when provided along with psychosocial counseling in patients with alcohol dependence. The current review highlights the application of these new therapies to primary care physicians' efforts on behalf of their patients with alcohol problems.","When compared with placebo, disulfiram failed to significantly increase abstinence rates or decrease relapse rates or cravings."
"How effective are pharmacologic agents for alcoholism
The opioid antagonist, naltrexone, is reported, in single centre studies, to improve the clinical outcome of individuals with alcohol dependence participating in outpatient psychosocial programmes. This is the first multicentre controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of naltrexone as adjunctive treatment for alcohol dependence or abuse. Patients who met criteria for alcohol dependence (n = 169) or alcohol abuse (n = 6) were randomly assigned to receive double-blind oral naltrexone 50 mg daily (n = 90) or placebo (n = 85) for 12 weeks as an adjunct to psychosocial treatment. The primary efficacy variable was time to first episode of heavy drinking; secondary efficacy assessments included time to first drink, alcohol consumption, craving, and changes in the serum biological markers gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), and aspartate and alanine aminotransferases. Compliance was assessed by tablet counts and, in the naltrexone-treated group, by measurement of urinary concentrations of 6-ss-naltrexol. Forty-nine (58%) patients randomized to placebo and 53 (59%) randomized to naltrexone did not complete the study. In intention-to-treat analyses, there was no difference between groups on measures of drinking. The median reduction from baseline of serum GGT (P: < 0.05) and the reductions in alcohol craving (Obsessive and Compulsive Drinking Scale: OCDS) were greater in the naltrexone group (P: < 0.05), from approximately half-way through the study. Of 70 patients (35 placebo; 35 naltrexone) who met an a priori definition of compliance (80% tablet consumption, attendance at all follow-up appointments), those allocated to naltrexone reported consuming half the amount of alcohol (P: < 0.05), had greater median reduction in serum GGT activity (P: < 0.05), and greater reduction in alcohol craving (OCDS total score: P: < 0.05; Obsessive subscale score: P: < 0.05), compared to patients in the placebo group. Use of naltrexone raised no safety concerns. Naltrexone is effective in treating alcohol dependence/abuse in conjunction with psychosocial therapy, in patients who comply with treatment.","When compared with placebo, nalmefene taken for 3 to 24 months significantly reduced relapse without affecting abstinence rates or cravings. Acamprosate taken for 3 to 24 months significantly increased abstinence rates, but did not significantly decrease relapse or cravings as compared with placebo."
"How effective are pharmacologic agents for alcoholism
To describe a preliminary investigation of a model of naltrexone therapy and counselling for use by primary care providers and evaluate its impact on drinking behaviors in a cohort of alcohol-dependent subjects. The subjects enrolled in this study were 29 alcohol-dependent individuals. They were managed within a primary care treatment model located at a university-affiliated substance research program in New Haven, Connecticut. Subjects were assigned to a primary care provider for treatment of their alcohol dependence and were placed on naltrexone at a dose of 50 mg per day. They were seen for an initial ""new patient"" visit and 7 ""brief"" follow-up visits during the 10-week study. The primary outcomes for this study were completion of treatment, change in drinking behaviors from baseline, change in liver enzymes from baseline, provider ratings of improvement, and patient ratings of improvement and satisfaction with treatment. Of the 29 subjects: 21 (72%) completed treatment, and 10 (35%) relapsed to heavy drinking. All drinking behaviors improved significantly from baseline: percent of days abstinent increased from 36.6% to 88.8% (P < 0.0001), percent days abstinent from heavy drinking increased from 48.7% to 97.3% (P < 0.0001), and mean number of drinks per occasion decreased from 9.5 to 2.5 (P < 0.0001). The mean serum gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT) for the group decreased from 67.1 U/L to 45.3 U/L (P < 0.0001). In this preliminary investigation, treatment of alcohol dependence with our model of naltrexone and counselling by primary care providers appeared to be both feasible and effective.",Naltrexone reduces relapse rates by one half to two thirds.
"How should we follow up a positive screen for anemia in a 1-year old
Iron deficiency and iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) are common in young children. It has been suggested that the lack of iron may have important effects on children's psychomotor development and cognitive function. To determine the effects of iron therapy on psychomotor development and cognitive function in iron deficient children less than 3 years of age. The following databases were searched: COCHRANE LIBRARY (2000 ISSUE 4) MEDLINE (1966-August 2000) EMBASE (1980-August 2000) Latin American Database (LILACS) PsycLIT Journal articles (1974-August 2000) PsycLIT Chapters and Books (1987-August 2000) The references of identified trials and of important review articles were scrutinised. Citation searches on trials from the primary search were performed within the Science Citation Index. Key authors were contacted. Studies were included if children less than 3 years of age with evidence of iron deficiency anaemia were randomly allocated to iron or iron and vitamin C versus a placebo or vitamin C alone and assessment of developmental status or cognitive function was carried out using standardised tests by observers blind to treatment allocation. Abstracts and titles of studies identified on searches of electronic databases were read to determine whether they might meet the inclusion criteria. Full copies of those possibly meeting these criteria from electronic or other searches were assessed by two independent reviewers. Differences of opinion about suitability for inclusion were resolved by discussion. Data were analysed separately depending on whether participants had iron assessments were performed within one month of beginning iron therapy or later. Five trials, including 180 children with IDA, examined the effects of iron therapy on measures of psychomotor development between 5 and 11 days of commencement of therapy. Data from four trials could be pooled. The pooled difference in pre to post treatment change in Bayley Scale PDI between iron treated and placebo groups was -3.2 (95%CI -7.24, 0.85) and in Bayley Scale MDI, 0.55 (95% CI -2.84, 1.75). Two studies, including 160 randomised children with IDA, examined the effects of iron therapy on measures of psychomotor development more than 30 days after commencement of therapy. Aukett et al reported the mean number of skills gained after two months of iron therapy, using the Denver test. The intervention group gained 0.8 (95% CI -0.18, 1.78) more skills on average than the control group. Idjrandinata et al reported that the difference in pre to post treatment change in Bayley Scale PDI between iron treated and placebo groups after 4 months was 18.40 (95%CI 10.16, 26.64) and in Bayley Scale MDI, 18.80 (95% CI 10.19, 27.41). There is no convincing evidence that iron treatment of young children with IDA has an effect on psychomotor development discernable within 5-11 days. The effect of longer term treatment remains unclear but the data would be compatible with clinically significant benefit. There is urgent need for further randomised controlled trials with long term follow up.","A recent Cochrane review suggests there is a clinically significant benefit for the treatment of iron-deficiency anemia; however, there is a need for further randomized controlled trials with long-term follow-up."
"How should we follow up a positive screen for anemia in a 1-year old
This study was designed to compare the effectiveness of laboratory tests for iron deficiency (mean corpuscular volume, erythrocyte protoporphyrin, transferrin saturation, and serum ferritin) in predicting hemoglobin response to iron therapy in infants found to have low Hgb concentrations. Screening for anemia was performed on capillary blood of 1,128 healthy 1-year-old infants of United States Air Force personnel. The 25% who had Hgb values less than 11.5 gm/dl were asked to return for tests on venous blood before therapy and again after three months of therapy. Of the 188 infants completing therapy, 66 (35%) had a rise in Hgb concentration greater than or equal to 1.0 gm/dl and were designated responders. None of the confirmatory tests on venous blood reliably distinguished responders from those who subsequently showed no response. By using any one of the tests in combination with a capillary Hgb value less than 11.5 gm/dl, more than half of the infants with an abnormal value responded. But well over half of the responders would have been missed if treatment had been restricted to infants with abnormal values. Neither changes in the criteria for normality nor combinations of tests substantially improved our ability to distinguish the two groups. Because of the difficulty in distinguishing responders from nonresponders with additional laboratory tests and because of the simplicity, low cost, and relative safety of iron therapy in infants, we favor an initial therapeutic trial of iron first for determining the cause of low Hgb values in similar high-risk populations. Further costly workup can then be reserved for the small number of infants who still have unexplained Hgb concentrations less than 11.0 gm/dl after a therapeutic trial.","A prospective study of 1128 children identified as anemic with a screening hemoglobin level showed that subsequent testing-which included mean corpuscular volume, protoporphyrin, transferrin, and ferritin measurements-did not reliably distinguish potential responders from nonresponders to a 3-month trial of empiric iron therapy. In fact, more than half of the responders would have been missed if treatment had been restricted to infants with abnormal mean corpuscular volume or iron studies. Because of the simplicity, low cost, and relative safety of iron therapy for infants, this trial suggests that a therapeutic trial of iron be given first, reserving further work-up for the small number of infants that still have unexplained hemoglobin concentrations of <11.0 g/dL after a therapeutic trial."
"How should we follow up a positive screen for anemia in a 1-year old
The purpose of this study was to determine the Hgb response to a therapeutic trial of iron in infants with anemia compared to those with low-normal hemoglobin values. Hgb was determined in 1.128 one-year-old infants. The 278 infants (25%) who had an Hgb less than 11.5 gm/dl were given a three-month oral course of ferrous sulfate (3 mg iron/kg/day); the regimen was satisfactorily completed by 188 infants. Of the 75 infants whose initial capillary Hgb was in the anemic range (Hgb less than 11.0 gm/dl), 45% had an increase in venous Hgb greater than or equal to 1.0 gm/dl. Of the 113 infants with initial capillary values in the low-normal range (11.0 to 11.4 gm/dl), 28% had greater than or equal to 1.0 gm/dl Hgb response. Despite the lower rate of response in the low-normal group, almost half of the infants with a greater than or equal to 1 gm/dl response would have been missed by using the generally accepted cutoff value of 11 gm/dl for a therapeutic trial. Because of the low cost and simplicity of a therapeutic trial, we favor including the low-normal Hgb group for a therapeutic trial of iron in order to avoid missing iron-responsive individuals among groups of infants with a similarly high prevalence of iron deficiency anemia.",Similar results were found in a trial of empiric iron therapy among infants with anemia.
"Should patients with acute DVT limit activity
Traditionally, many patients with acute deep vein thrombosis (DVT) are treated not only by anticoagulation therapy but additionally by strict bed rest, which is aimed at reducing the risk of pulmonary embolism (PE) events. However, this risk has not been subjected to empirical verification. The Registro Informatizado de la Enfermedad TromboEmbólica is a Spanish registry of consecutively enrolled patients with objectively confirmed, symptomatic acute DVT or PE. In this analysis, the clinical characteristics, details of anticoagulant therapy, and clinical outcomes of enrolled patients with and without strict bed rest prescribed during the first 15 days were compared. Patients in whom ambulation was not possible were not included in this analysis. A total of 2,650 patients entered the study (DVT, 2,038 patients; PE, 612 patients). Of these patients, 1,050 DVT patients (52%) and 385 PE patients (63%) were prescribed strict bed rest. New events of symptomatic, objectively confirmed PE developed during the 15-day study period in 11 patients with DVT (0.5%) and 4 patients with PE (0.7%). Five of these 15 patients (33%) died as a result of their PE. Age < 65 years (odds ratio [OR], 3.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.98 to 11) and cancer (OR, 3.0; 95% CI, 0.98 to 9.1) were associated with an increased rate of new PEs. There were not significant differences between bedridden and ambulant patients in terms of new PE events, fatal PE, or bleeding complications. Our findings confirm those from previous reports suggesting that bed rest has no influence on the risk of developing PE among patients with acute DVT of the lower limbs. In addition, our findings show for the first time the lack of influence of bed rest even in patients presenting with acute submassive PE.","A study using the RIETE registry, a Spanish registry of consecutively enrolled patients with objectively confirmed acute DVT or PE, found no significant difference in occurrence of new PE between immobilized and mobilized patients. Patients with DVT who were immobilized were generally sicker, more likely to have PaO2 <60, and more likely to have received lower doses of low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) compared with the group that walked (P<.005)."
"Should patients with acute DVT limit activity
To elucidate the risk of pulmonary embolism (PE) in patients with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) who are kept walking with compression bandages. Perfusion/ventilation scanning of the lungs was performed at admission and after 10 days of treatment. General community hospital. A total of 631 consecutive patients were studied (upper limit of the thrombi: iliofemoral vein, n=212; femoral or popliteal vein, n=302; lower leg, n=117). The patients received different dose regimens of low-molecular-weight heparin (dalteparin) subcutaneously. The study revealed that the prevalence of PE at baseline was between 45.1% and 51% (95% CI 38.2-55.2 and 45.2-56.8% respectively) in patients with proximal DVT, and 31.9% (95% CI 23.6-41.2%) in those with DVT restricted to the lower leg. The majority of these cases of PE were completely asymptomatic. The incidence of a new PE, revealed by a second lung scan on day 10 after admission, was 7.0% (95% CI 3.9-11.4%) in patients with iliofemoral DVT, 5.5% (95% CI 3.2-8.7%) in those with femoropopliteal DVT and 2.7% (95% CI 0.6-7.6%) in those with lower-leg DVT. These incidence rates for new PEs were significantly lower than the rates previously reported (p<0.01). The fatality rate was also lower compared with the literature: one patient suffered a fatal PE (0.2%; 95% CI 0-0.9%), four patients died from malignant tumours, and one from pneumonia. The frequency of malignant tumours was greater in this study than in the literature (23% in patients with iliofemoral DVT, 14% in those with femoropopliteal DVT and 9% in those with DVT of the lower leg). Mobile patients with DVT do not need bed-rest. Low-molecular-weight heparin s.c., compression bandages and walking exercises make home-treatment of DVT feasible.",A cohort study in which 691 patients were kept walking with compression therapy reported a mortality rate of 0.2%.

The PHLECO Study (phlebothrombosis conservative therapy) is a multicenter investigation of patients with deep vein thrombosis receiving conservative nonfibrinolytic hospital treatment. A second study (part II: PHLEFI, phlebothrombosis fibrinolytic treatment) to be published later deals with the outcome of fibrinolytic therapy. In both studies the incidence of life-threatening sequelae, such as pulmonary embolism, is of major interest. The 49 medical departments participating in the study mailed the relevant data to the Duisburg Coordination Center for further data analysis and the following information was gained: (a) In descending order of frequency, the clinical conditions of thrombosis were: immobility, postoperative status, malignancy, hormone treatment, posttraumatic conditions, and pregnancy. (b) In descending order of frequency, the sites of thrombosis were: femoral vein, calf vein, iliac vein, popliteal vein, and subclavian vein. Left-sided thrombosis predominated in the iliac and subclavian vein groups. (c) In descending order of frequency, the treatment regimens employed were: intravenous heparin+oral anticoagulants, intravenous heparin+subcutaneous heparin, intravenous heparin alone, subcutaneous heparin alone, intravenous heparin+subcutaneous heparin+oral anticoagulants, subcutaneous heparin+oral anticoagulants, intravenous heparin+platelet aggregation inhibitors. (d) The average hospital stay was 23.7 +/- 15.6 days. No correlation existed between duration of hospital stay and particular types of therapy. (e) The incidence of nonfatal pulmonary embolism was 16.1% while that of fatal pulmonary embolism was 2.33%. (f) Women outnumbered men in the group with fatal pulmonary embolism, and the death rate among older patients was higher than that among younger patients. (g) Patients with fatal pulmonary embolism had a shorter history of thrombosis than patients in the unselected cohort (patients with and without pulmonary embolism).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","A retrospective, multicenter cohort of 1647 patients treated with unfractionated heparin and bed rest in different German hospitals reported a rate of fatal PE of 2.33%."
"How should we treat major depression combined with anxiety
Severity of anxiety does not appear to influence the antidepressant response to fluoxetine during acute treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). We report a retrospective pooled analysis of 2 studies to assess the effect of associated anxiety on the efficacy of fluoxetine in the continuation treatment phase of MDD. Patients whose MDD remitted (study 1) or responded (study 2) after approximately 12 to 13 weeks of open-label treatment with fluoxetine 20 mg daily were randomly assigned in double-blind fashion to placebo, continued treatment with fluoxetine 20 mg daily, or, in study 2 only, treatment with enteric-coated fluoxetine 90 mg once weekly, for at least 25 weeks. Both studies included male and female outpatients who met criteria for MDD as assessed by DSM-III-R (study 1) or DSM-IV (study 2). Patients were categorized into high anxiety (> or = 7) or low anxiety (< 7) subgroups based on baseline Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) anxiety/somatization subfactor scores. Subgroups were compared by therapy for time from randomization to relapse and change in efficacy scores. No significant differences in time to relapse were observed between anxiety subgroups in either active treatment group. However, in patients switched to placebo for continuation treatment, the high anxiety subgroup had a significantly higher risk of relapse than those with low anxiety (risk ratio = 1.63, p =.013). Significant differences between anxiety groups were seen in change in HAM-D anxiety/somatization subfactor scores in the fluoxetine 20 mg and placebo treatment groups, and in change in HAM-D-17 scores in the placebo treatment group (p <.05). Although high baseline anxiety does not appear to impact the benefit of continuation therapy with fluoxetine, it does appear to predict increased risk of relapse in individuals who do not remain on antidepressant therapy for the duration of continuation treatment.",Patients with major depression and high anxiety levels relapsed more often than those with low anxiety levels with discontinuation of fluoxetine compared with placebo in a double-blind placebo-controlled parallel trial with 596 patients.
"What other STI testing should we do for a patient with chlamydia
Juvenile detention centers offer public health practitioners an opportunity to gain access to large numbers of adolescents at risk for chlamydia and gonorrhea. To describe the prevalence and coinfection of chlamydia and gonorrhea among adolescents in 14 US juvenile detention centers from 1997 to 2002. We calculated the prevalence of chlamydia and gonorrhea in males and females, stratified by race/ethnicity, age group, and site. We also calculated the proportion of adolescents with chlamydia that were coinfected with gonorrhea and the proportion of those with gonorrhea that were coinfected with chlamydia. The prevalence of chlamydia was 15.6% in 33,619 females and 5.9% in 98,296 males; gonorrhea prevalence was 5.1% in females and 1.3% in males. Of females with gonorrhea, 54% were coinfected with chlamydia, and 51% of males with gonorrhea were coinfected with chlamydia. Chlamydia and gonorrhea prevalence was very high in females in all project sites. In males, chlamydia prevalence was high in some areas; however, gonorrhea prevalence was substantially lower. These prevalence data justify screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea among female adolescents in juvenile detention centers nationally.","A study of the prevalence rate of chlamydia, gonorrhea, and their coinfection in an adolescent population (women n=131,915 and men n=71,074) of juvenile detention centers between 1997 and 2002 found that 18% of women and 13% of males with chlamydia were coinfected with gonorrhea."

These recommendations for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing are intended for all health-care providers in the public and private sectors, including those working in hospital emergency departments, urgent care clinics, inpatient services, substance abuse treatment clinics, public health clinics, community clinics, correctional health-care facilities, and primary care settings. The recommendations address HIV testing in health-care settings only. They do not modify existing guidelines concerning HIV counseling, testing, and referral for persons at high risk for HIV who seek or receive HIV testing in nonclinical settings (e.g., community-based organizations, outreach settings, or mobile vans). The objectives of these recommendations are to increase HIV screening of patients, including pregnant women, in health-care settings; foster earlier detection of HIV infection; identify and counsel persons with unrecognized HIV infection and link them to clinical and prevention services; and further reduce perinatal transmission of HIV in the United States. These revised recommendations update previous recommendations for HIV testing in health-care settings and for screening of pregnant women (CDC. Recommendations for HIV testing services for inpatients and outpatients in acute-care hospital settings. MMWR 1993;42[No. RR-2]:1-10; CDC. Revised guidelines for HIV counseling, testing, and referral. MMWR 2001;50[No. RR-19]:1-62; and CDC. Revised recommendations for HIV screening of pregnant women. MMWR 2001;50[No. RR-19]:63-85). Major revisions from previously published guidelines are as follows: For patients in all health-care settings HIV screening is recommended for patients in all health-care settings after the patient is notified that testing will be performed unless the patient declines (opt-out screening). Persons at high risk for HIV infection should be screened for HIV at least annually. Separate written consent for HIV testing should not be required; general consent for medical care should be considered sufficient to encompass consent for HIV testing. Prevention counseling should not be required with HIV diagnostic testing or as part of HIV screening programs in health-care settings. For pregnant women HIV screening should be included in the routine panel of prenatal screening tests for all pregnant women. HIV screening is recommended after the patient is notified that testing will be performed unless the patient declines (opt-out screening). Separate written consent for HIV testing should not be required; general consent for medical care should be considered sufficient to encompass consent for HIV testing. Repeat screening in the third trimester is recommended in certain jurisdictions with elevated rates of HIV infection among pregnant women.","All patients seeking treatment for STDs, including all patients attending STD clinics, should be screened routinely for HIV during each visit for a new complaint, regardless of whether the patient is known or suspected to have specific behavior risks for HIV infection."
"How do we evaluate a marginally low B12 level
Vitamin B12 deficiency is common and rises with age. Most people with vitamin B12 deficiency are treated in primary care with intramuscular vitamin B12 which is a considerable source of work for health care professionals. Several case control and case series studies have reported equal efficacy of oral administration of vitamin B12 but it is rarely prescribed in this form, other than in Sweden and Canada. Doctors may not be prescribing oral formulations because they are unaware of this option or have concerns regarding effectiveness. To assess the effectiveness of oral vitamin B12 versus intramuscular vitamin B12 for vitamin B12 deficiency. Searches were undertaken of The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE and Lilacs in early 2005. The bibliographies of all relevant papers identified using this strategy were searched. In addition we contacted authors of relevant identified studies and Vitamin B12 research and pharmaceutical companies to enquire about other published or unpublished studies and ongoing trials. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) examining the use of oral or intramuscular vitamin B12 to treat vitamin B12 deficiency. All abstracts or titles identified by the electronic searches were independently scrutinised by two reviewers. When a difference between reviewers arose, we obtained and reviewed a hard copy of the papers and made decisions by consensus. We obtained a copy of all pre-selected papers and two researchers independently extracted the data from these studies using piloted data extraction forms. The whole group checked whether inclusion and exclusion criteria were met, and disagreement was decided by consensus. The methodological quality of the included studies was independently assessed by two researchers and disagreements were brought back to the whole group and resolved by consensus. Two RCT's comparing oral with intramuscular administration of vitamin B12 met our inclusion criteria. The trials recruited a total of 108 participants and followed up 93 of these from 90 days to four months. High oral doses of B12 (1000 mcg and 2000 mcg) were as effective as intramuscular administration in achieving haematological and neurological responses. The evidence derived from these limited studies suggests that 2000 mcg doses of oral vitamin B12 daily and 1000 mcg doses initially daily and thereafter weekly and then monthly may be as effective as intramuscular administration in obtaining short term haematological and neurological responses in vitamin B12 deficient patients.","A Cochrane Collaboration review of oral vitamin B12 replacement found that these high doses seemed as effective as intramuscular vitamin B12 in all B12-deficient patients-even those with pernicious anemia, Crohn's disease, ileal resection, or malabsorption states. The authors of the review recommend a ""further large, pragmatic trial in a primary care setting"" to determine whether oral vitamin B12 is effective for patients with major common cases of malabsorption and to provide additional evidence for cost effectiveness."
"What's the best treatment for sebaceous cysts
The removal of keratinous and pilar cysts by the punch incision technique is an alternative to traditional excision methods. It is easy to perform with commonly available instruments, and quick. Faster healing and less scarring are advantages because of the small opening through which the cysts are removed. No previous studies have documented recurrence rates of cysts removed by this technique or the recurrence rates following either traditional excision surgery or other alternative minimal excision techniques. We provide data demonstrating that the removal of keratinous and pilar cysts by the punch incision technique is a viable option with an acceptably low recurrence rate. To evaluate the overall recurrence rates of keratinous and pilar cysts removed by the punch incision technique and rates of recurrence by location and using other cyst characteristics. A preliminary retrospective chart review of cysts removed exclusively by the punch incision technique from 1989 to 1998 was performed. The rate of cyst recurrence and average time to patient-initiated follow-up visit for evaluation and removal were determined. In a second study, a survey requested information on the presence of cyst recurrence. This was mailed to all 646 patients who had cysts removed by the punch incision technique from 1989 to 1998 to evaluate possible cyst recurrence in patients who did not choose to follow-up at the office. Statistical analysis was performed to determine the overall recurrence rates and recurrence rates based on location and other cyst characteristics. Preliminary chart review revealed a recurrence rate of 3.6%, with a mean time to patient-initiated follow-up of 79.3 weeks. In the second study, an analysis of cyst recurrence rates in patients returning the survey revealed an 8.3% recurrence rate. Subanalysis revealed a trend showing that inflamed cysts had a lower recurrence rate. Another trend noted was that cysts removed from the back and ear had the highest recurrence rates (13.8 and 13.0%, respectively) compared to those removed from other locations. Most cysts (54.5%) recurred within the first year after punch incision removal. This is the first study to document recurrence rates using the punch incision technique for removal of epithelial cysts. Though most recurrences occur within the first year, there is a delay in patients reporting to their doctors for reexcision, perhaps because recurrent cysts are often asymptomatic. Studies to determine the recurrence rates for cyst excision using other techniques should be performed. The punch incision technique, when properly performed, is a satisfactory removal method with a recurrence rate of less then 10%.","Minimal excision and punch biopsy techniques are purported to produce minimal bleeding, have faster healing times, and produce less scarring."
"Are there big differences among beta-blockers in treating essential hypertension
beta-Blocker therapy remains substantially underused in cardiac patients despite its proven mortality benefits. Reluctance to prescribe these agents may derive from concerns about their association with symptoms of depression, fatigue, and sexual dysfunction. To determine the association of beta-blockers with depressive symptoms, fatigue, and sexual dysfunction by performing a quantitative review of randomized trials that tested beta-blockers in myocardial infarction, heart failure, and hypertension. Randomized trials of beta-blockers used in the treatment of myocardial infarction, heart failure, or hypertension were identified by searching the MEDLINE database for English-language articles (1966-2001). In addition, we searched the reference lists of previously published trials and reviews of beta-blockers for additional studies. Criteria for inclusion of trials in the review were: random allocation of study treatments, placebo control, noncrossover design, enrollment of at least 100 patients, and a minimum of 6 months of follow-up. The initial search produced 475 articles, 42 of which met these criteria. Fifteen of these trials reported on depressive symptoms, fatigue, or sexual dysfunction and were selected for inclusion. For each trial, 1 author abstracted the frequency of adverse events in the beta-blocker and placebo groups and the numbers of patients randomized to the treatment groups. Two other authors verified the counts of events, and all authors adjudicated any discrepancies. Two different types of information on adverse events were abstracted: patient-reported symptoms and withdrawal of therapy due to a specified symptom. We categorized the tested beta-blockers by generation (early vs late) and lipid solubility (high vs low to moderate). The 15 trials involved more than 35,000 subjects. beta-Blocker therapy was not associated with a significant absolute annual increase in risk of reported depressive symptoms (6 per 1000 patients; 95% confidence interval [CI], -7 to 19). beta-Blockers were associated with a small significant annual increase in risk of reported fatigue (18 per 1000 patients; 95% CI, 5-30), equivalent to 1 additional report of fatigue for every 57 patients treated per year with beta-blockers. beta-Blockers were also associated with a small, significant annual increase in risk of reported sexual dysfunction (5 per 1000 patients; 95% CI, 2-8), equivalent to one additional report for every 199 patients treated per year. None of the risks of adverse effects differed significantly by degree of beta-blocker lipid solubility. The risk associated with reported fatigue was significantly higher for early-generation than for late-generation beta-blockers (P =.04). The conventional wisdom that beta-blocker therapy is associated with substantial risks of depressive symptoms, fatigue, and sexual dysfunction is not supported by data from clinical trials. There is no significant increased risk of depressive symptoms and only small increased risks of fatigue and sexual dysfunction. The risks of these adverse effects should be put in the context of the documented benefits of these medications.","That said, beta-blockers do have side effects. One meta-analysis found no difference in the development of depression with beta-blocker therapy; however, first-generation beta-blockers (propranolol and timolol) had higher rates of fatigue than did the later beta-blockers. They reported that the risk of fatigue was only 18 per 1000 patients (95% confidence interval [CI], 5-30) and the risk for sexual dysfunction was 5 per 1000 patients (95% CI, 2-8) for all beta-blockers as a class. Importantly, they also stratified side-effect findings on the basis of lipophilic vs nonlipophilic and found no difference in side effect frequency."
"What is the risk of adverse outcomes in a woman who develops mild hypertension from OCs
Both cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis of data from 13,358 women showed that oral contraceptive use is associated with a slight but statistically significant (P lesser than .05) rise in mean blood pressure, which is reversible. The age-adjusted proportion of oral contraceptive users with a blood pressure over 140/90 mm Hg was about three times that on nonusers. These findings are caused by a uniform upward shift in the blood pressure distribution of oral contraceptive users compared to nonusers. Women continuing oral contraceptive use had no appreciably greater change in blood pressure between two visits than persistent nonusers. The clinical implications of a mild contraceptive-induced blood pressure elevation (systolic, 5 to 6 mm Hg; diastolic, 1 to 2 mm Hg) remain unsettled but disturbing.","Three studies showed that blood pressure elevations due to taking oral contraceptives returned to baseline with discontinuation of the medication. A prospective cohort study followed 13,358 women who were neither pregnant nor postpartum between the ages of 15 and 60.

"What is the best medical therapy for new-onset type 2 diabetes
Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors such as acarbose or miglitol, have the potential to improve glycemic control in type 2 diabetes mellitus. The true value of these agents, especially in relation to diabetes related mortality and morbidity, has never been investigated in a systematic literature review and meta-analysis. To assess the effects of alpha-glucosidase inhibitors s in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. We searched The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Current Contents, LILACS, databases of ongoing trials, reference lists of reviews on the topic of alpha-glucosidase inhibitors and we contacted experts and manufacturers for additional trials. Date of most recent search: December 2003 (Current Contents) and April 2003 (other databases). Randomised controlled trials of at least 12 weeks duration comparing alpha-glucosidase inhibitor monotherapy in patients with type 2 diabetes with any other intervention and that included at least one of the following outcomes: mortality, morbidity, quality of life, glycemic control, lipids, insulin levels, body weight, adverse events. Two reviewers read all abstracts, assessed quality and extracted data independently. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus or by the judgement of a third reviewer. A statistician checked all extracted data entrance in the database. We attempted to contact all authors for data clarification. We included 41 trials (8130 participants), 30 investigated acarbose, seven miglitol, one trial voglibose and three trials compared different alpha-glucosidase inhibitors. Study duration was 24 weeks in most cases and only two studies lasted amply longer than one year. We found only few data on mortality, morbidity and quality of life. Acarbose had a clear effect on glycemic control compared to placebo: glycated haemoglobin -0.8% (95% confidence interval -0.9 to -0.7), fasting blood glucose -1.1 mmol/L (95% confidence interval -1.4 to -0.9), post-load blood glucose -2.3 mmol/L (95% confidence interval -2.7 to -1.9). The effect on glycated haemoglobin by acarbose was not dose-dependent. We found a decreasing effect on post-load insulin and no clinically relevant effects on lipids or body weight. Adverse effects were mostly of gastro-intestinal origin and dose dependent. Compared to sulphonylurea, acarbose decreased fasting and post-load insulin levels by -24.8 pmol/L (95% confidence interval -43.3 to -6.3) and -133.2 pmol/L (95% confidence interval -184.5 to -81.8) respectively and acarbose caused more adverse effects. It remains unclear whether alpha-glucosidase inhibitors influence mortality or morbidity in patients with type 2 diabetes. Conversely, they have a significant effect on glycemic control and insulin levels, but no statistically significant effect on lipids and body weight. These effects are less sure when alpha-glucosidase inhibitors are used for a longer duration. Acarbose dosages higher than 50 mg TID offer no additional effect on glycated hemoglobin but more adverse effects instead. Compared to sulphonylurea, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors lower fasting and post-load insulin levels and have an inferior profile regarding glycemic control and adverse effects.","A meta-analysis of head to head studies involving Α-glucosidase inhibitors included 8 trials comparing acarbose with sulfonylureas. In pooled results, sulfonylureas trended towards greater HbA1c reduction but did not reach significance (additional HbA1c decrease 0.4%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0%-0.8%)."
"What is the best medical therapy for new-onset type 2 diabetes
Effective type 2 diabetes management requires prompt intervention if glycemic control is not achieved by nonpharmacological means. This study investigates whether inhaled insulin (INH; Exubera) can achieve target glycemic control in patients failing on diet and exercise. Patients with suboptimal control on diet and exercise (HbA(1c) [A1C] 8-11%) were randomized to 3 months' treatment with either INH before meals (n = 76) or rosiglitazone 4 mg twice a day (n = 69), in conjunction with a diet and exercise regimen. The primary end point was percentage of patients achieving A1C <8.0%. The INH and rosiglitazone groups had comparable baseline A1C values (9.5 vs. 9.4%, respectively). Significantly more patients achieved A1C <8.0% (83 vs. 58%, adjusted odds ratio 7.14 [95% CI 2.48-20.58], P = 0.0003), A1C <7.0% (44 vs. 18%, 4.43 [1.94-10.12]), and A1C < or = 6.5% (28 vs. 7.5% 5.34 [1.83-15.57]) with INH. A1C decrease was greater with INH (-2.3% vs. -1.4%, adjusted treatment group difference: -0.89% [95% CI -1.23 to -0.55]) with final mean A1C values of 7.2 and 8.0% for INH and rosiglitazone, respectively. Hypoglycemia (episodes per subject-month) was higher with INH (0.7 vs. 0.05, risk ratio 14.72 [95% CI 7.51-28.83]), with no severe hypoglycemic episodes. Pulmonary function changes were small and comparable between groups. INH could be an effective therapy for people with type 2 diabetes early in the course of their disease.","Inhaled insulin may expand the list of initial therapies for type 2 diabetes. A 12-week manufacturer-sponsored RCT with 134 patients (mean HbA1c=9.5) compared inhaled insulin with rosiglitazone (Avandia). More patients using inhaled insulin achieved an HbA1c <8.0 (82.7% vs 58.2%; P=.0003); however, inhaled insulin produced more adverse effects, including cough and hypoglycemia."
"What is the role of combination therapy insulin plus oral medication in type 2 diabetes
It is unclear whether patients with type 2 diabetes who have poor glycaemic control despite maximal oral hypoglycaemic agents (OHAs) should be commenced on insulin as monotherapy, or insulin combined with oral hypoglycaemic agents (insulin-OHA combination therapy). To assess the effects of insulin monotherapy versus insulin-OHA combinations therapy. Eligible studies were identified by searching MEDLINE, EMBASE, and The Cochrane Library. Date of last search: May 2004. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with 2 months minimum follow-up duration comparing insulin monotherapy (all schemes) with insulin-OHA combination therapy. Data extraction and assessment of study quality were undertaken by three reviewers in pairs. Twenty RCTs (mean trial duration 10 months) including 1,811 participants, with mean age 59.8 years and mean known duration of diabetes 9.6 years. Overall, study methodological quality was low. Twenty-eight comparisons in 20 RCTs were ordered according to clinical considerations. No studies assessed diabetes-related morbidity, mortality or total mortality. From 13 studies (21 comparisons), sufficient data were extracted to calculate pooled effects on glycaemic control. Insulin-OHA combination therapy had statistically significant benefits on glycaemic control over insulin monotherapy only when the latter was applied as a once-daily injection of NPH insulin. Conversely, twice-daily insulin monotherapy (NPH or mixed insulin) provided superior glycaemic control to insulin-OHA combination therapy regimens where insulin was administered as a single morning injection. In more conventional comparisons, regimens utilising OHAs with bedtime NPH insulin provided comparable glycaemic control to insulin monotherapy (administered as twice daily, or multiple daily injections). Overall, insulin-OHA combination therapy was associated with a 43% relative reduction in total daily insulin requirement compared to insulin monotherapy. Of the 14 studies (22 comparisons) reporting hypoglycaemia, 13 demonstrated no significant difference in the frequency of symptomatic or biochemical hypoglycaemia between insulin and combination therapy regimens. No significant differences in quality of life related issues were detected. Combination therapy with bedtime NPH insulin resulted in statistically significantly less weight gain compared to insulin monotherapy, provided metformin was used +/-sulphonylurea. In all other comparisons no significant differences with respect to weight gain were detected. Bedtime NPH insulin combined with oral hypoglycaemic agents provides comparable glycaemic control to insulin monotherapy and is associated with less weight gain if metformin is used.","A systematic review evaluated beginning combination therapy (adding insulin to oral medication) compared with switching to insulin alone in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with inadequate glycemic control on oral medication. Twenty RCTs studied a total of 1811 patients; glycemic control was the primary outcome measure. Oral medication comprised either sulfonylureas (75%), metformin (4%), or both (21%). Individual studies used different insulin dosing schedules and statistical measures. However, overall, combination therapy provided glucose control comparable with insulin alone. In only 1 small, low-quality study did insulin plus metformin reduce HbA1c more than other combination therapy regimens or insulin alone. Ten studies reported a trend toward less weight gain with combination therapy that included metformin. Fourteen studies found the same incidence of hypoglycemic episodes in combination therapy and insulin alone."
"What could be behind your elderly patient's subjective memory complaints
Behavioural brain reserve is a property of the central nervous system related to sustained and complex mental activity which can lead to differential expression of brain injury. Behavioural brain reserve has been assessed using autobiographical data such as education levels, occupational complexity and mentally stimulating lifestyle pursuits. So far there have been several epidemiological reports but no systematic review to put conflicting results into context. Our aim was to quantitatively review evidence for the effect of brain reserve on incident dementia. Cohort studies of the effects of education, occupation, premorbid IQ and mental activities on dementia risk were of interest. Abstracts were identified in MEDLINE (1966-September 2004), CURRENT CONTENTS (to September, 2004), PsychINFO (1984-September 2004), Cochrane Library Databases and reference lists from relevant articles. Twenty-two studies met inclusion criteria. Key information was extracted by both reviewers onto a standard template with a high level of agreement. Studies were combined through a quantitative random-effects meta-analysis. Higher brain reserve was associated with a lowered risk for incident dementia (summary odds ratio, 0.54; 95% confidence interval, 0.49-0.59). This effect was found over a median of 7.1 years follow-up and resulted from integrating data across more than 29000 individuals. Notably, increased complex mental activity in late life was associated with lower dementia rates independent of other predictors; a dose-response relationship was also evident between extent of complex mental activities in late life and dementia risk. This study demonstrates robust evidence that complex patterns of mental activity in the early, mid- and late-life stages is associated with a significant reduction in dementia incidence. Randomized control trials based on brain-reserve principles are now required.","One systematic review of 22 longitudinal cohort studies, which included more than 29,000 patients, evaluated complex patterns of mental activity in early, mid-, and late-life in relation to the incidence of dementia. Dementia was diagnosed at a significantly lower rate in patients with a higher level of cognitive exercise, such as memory-based leisure activities and social interactions, than those with less rigorous daily cognitive challenges (relative risk=0.54; 95% CI, 0.49-0.59)."
"Which drugs are most effective for moderate to severe depression in adolescents
Depressive disorders are common in young people and are associated with significant negative impacts. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are often used, however, evidence of their effectiveness in children and adolescents is not clear. Furthermore, there have been warnings against their use in this population due to concerns about increased risk of suicidal ideation and behaviour. To determine the efficacy and adverse outcomes, including definitive suicidal behaviour and suicidal ideation, of SSRIs compared to placebo in the treatment of depressive disorders in children and adolescents. We searched the CCDAN Trials Register, MEDLINE, PSYCHINFO and CENTRAL. Reference lists were checked, letters were sent to key researchers and internet databases searched. We included published and unpublished randomised controlled trials. Two or three review authors selected the trials, assessed the quality and extracted trial and outcome data. We used a fixed-effect meta-analysis. The relative risk was used to summarise dichotomous outcomes and the mean difference to summarise continuous measures. Twelve trials were eligible for inclusion, with ten providing usable data. At 8-12 weeks, there was evidence that children and adolescents 'responded' to treatment with SSRIs (RR 1.28, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.41). There was also evidence of an increased risk of suicidal ideation and behaviour for those prescribed SSRIs (RR 1.80, 95% CI 1.19 to 2.72). Fluoxetine was the only SSRI where there was consistent evidence from three trials that it was effective in reducing depression symptoms in both children and adolescents (CDRS-R treatment effect -5.63, 95% CI -7.38 to -3.88), and 'response' to treatment (RR 1.86, 95% CI 1.49 to 2.32). Where rates of adverse events were reported, this was higher for those prescribed SSRIs. Caution is required to interpret the results. First, there were methodological issues, including high attrition, issues regarding measurement instruments and clinical usefulness of outcomes, often variously defined across trials. Second, patients seen in clinical practice are likely to be more unwell, and at greater risk of suicide, compared to those in the trials, and it is unclear how this group would respond to SSRIs. This needs to be considered, along with the evidence of an increased risk of suicide related outcomes in those treated with SSRIs. It is unclear what the effect of SSRIs is on suicide completion. While untreated depression is associated with the risk of completed suicide and impacts on functioning, it is unclear whether SSRIs would modify this risk in a clinically meaningful way.","A 2007 Cochrane review supports the use of SSRIs to treat major depressive disorder in adolescents, reporting efficacy as 1.28 times that of placebo (95% confidence interval, 1.17-1.41). Quality of available clinical evidence is limited. Statistical significance was demonstrated in meta-analyses only when data from smaller trials were combined. Fluoxetine was the only antidepressant studied in nonindustry-sponsored trials for major depressive disorder in adolescents. Moreover, results are not often reported separately for children (5-12 years of age) and adolescents (12-18 years of age)."
"What is the most effective beta-blocker for heart failure
To briefly discuss the pathophysiology of heart failure and the rationale for the use of beta-blockers in the treatment of chronic heart failure. Key morbidity reduction trials are briefly mentioned, and recent mortality reduction trials are reviewed. General recommendations regarding the use of beta-blockers in heart failure are also included to guide clinical practice. Randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials and meta-analyses evaluating mortality reduction with beta-blockers in the treatment of heart failure were identified using a MEDLINE search from January 1993 to March 2000. Abstracts and presented results from recent scientific meetings were also considered. Beta-blockers have been shown to decrease hospitalization for worsening heart failure, decrease the need for heart transplant, improve New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class, and increase left-ventricular ejection fraction. A mortality benefit has recently been demonstrated for patients with chronic heart failure. Carvedilol, bisoprolol, and controlled-release/extended-release metoprolol decreased the risk of dying by 65%, 34%, and 34%, respectively, in patients with primarily NYHA functional class II or III and systolic dysfunction. The benefit of these agents in patients with class IV heart failure or determining whether one agent has an advantage over another is being investigated in ongoing clinical trials. Several beta-blockers have demonstrated mortality reduction in the treatment of patients with NYHA functional class II or III heart failure and systolic dysfunction. Beta-blockers should be considered in these patients when they are clinically stable and taking the current standard therapy of a diuretic plus an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or other vasodilator agent.",The US Carvedilol trial had several methodologic problems: it was a composite of 4 smaller studies that used exercise tolerance as the primary endpoint; median duration of data collection on subjects was only 6 months; it included many minimally symptomatic patients; the actual number of deaths was small (producing a wide confidence interval); and subjects who did not survive the run-in phase were excluded from analysis.
"What is the most effective beta-blocker for heart failure
Controlled clinical trials have shown that beta-blockers can produce hemodynamic and symptomatic improvement in chronic heart failure, but the effect of these drugs on survival has not been determined. We enrolled 1094 patients with chronic heart failure in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, stratified program, in which patients were assigned to one of the four treatment protocols on the basis of their exercise capacity. Within each of the four protocols patients with mild, moderate, or severe heart failure with left ventricular ejection fractions < or = 0.35 were randomly assigned to receive either placebo (n = 398) or the beta-blocker carvedilol (n = 696); background therapy with digoxin, diuretics, and an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor remained constant. Patient were observed for the occurrence death or hospitalization for cardiovascular reasons during the following 6 months, after the beginning (12 months for the group with mild heart failure). The overall mortality rate was 7.8 percent in the placebo group and 3.2 percent in the carvedilol group; the reduction in risk attributable to carvedilol was 65 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 39 to 80 percent; P < 0.001). This finding led the Data and Safety Monitoring Board to recommend termination of the study before its scheduled completion. In addition, as compared with placebo, carvedilol therapy was accompanied by a 27 percent reduction in the risk of hospitalization for cardiovascular causes (19.6 percent vs. 14.1 percent, P = 0.036), as well as a 38 percent reduction in the combined risk of hospitalization or death (24.6 percent vs, 15.8 percent, P < 0.001). Worsening heart failure as an adverse reaction during treatment was less frequent in the carvedilol than in the placebo group. Carvedilol reduces the risk or death as well as the risk of hospitalization for cardiovascular causes in patients with heart failure who are receiving treatment with digoxin, diuretics, and an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor.",The US Carvedilol trial demonstrated a larger reduction in mortality than that seen in other beta-blocker trials.
"What is the most effective beta-blocker for heart failure
At 32-month follow-up of older patients with prior myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, and a left ventricular ejection fraction > or = 40% treated with diuretics plus angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and also with digoxin if atrial fibrillation was present, propranolol caused a 35% significant reduction in total mortality and a 37% significant decrease in total mortality plus nonfatal myocardial infarction compared with no propranolol. At 1-year follow-up, propranolol caused a significantly greater increase in left ventricular ejection fraction (6%) and a significantly greater reduction in left ventricular mass (34 g) than did no propranolol (2% and 20 g, respectively).",No large studies of older beta-blockers adequately assess mortality in heart failure. One study of propranolol (N=158) showed a 27% reduction in mortality in mild heart failure in the setting of ischemic heart disease.
"What is the most effective beta-blocker for heart failure
In large clinical trials both carvedilol and metoprolol have been shown to reduce mortality and morbidity in patients with chronic heart failure. Carvedilol is an adrenoceptor antagonist, which inhibits beta(1)-, beta(2)-, and alpha(1)-adrenergic receptors. Carvedilol has additional metabolic and antioxidant properties. Metoprolol is a selective antagonist of beta(1)-adrenergic receptors. The carvedilol or metoprolol European trial (COMET) is the first study to investigate whether beta-blocking agents with differing pharmacological profiles exert different effects on morbidity and mortality in patients with chronic heart failure. 3029 patients from 15 different European countries were enrolled into COMET and will be followed until 1020 fatal events have been observed, unless the data and safety monitoring committee (DSMC) recommends early termination. The target dose for carvedilol is 25 mg bid and for metoprolol tartrate 50 mg bid. This manuscript outlines the rationale, design and possible outcomes of COMET.","The Carvedilol or Metoprolol European Trial (COMET), a larger head-to-head trial of carvedilol and metoprolol (N=3029), is ongoing."
"Can infants/toddlers get enough fluoride through brushing
Topical fluorides in the form of toothpaste, mouthrinse, varnish and gel are effective caries preventive measures. However, there is uncertainty about the relative value of these interventions. To compare the effectiveness of one form of topical fluoride intervention with another when used for the prevention of dental caries in children. We searched the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (May 2000), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2000), MEDLINE (1966 to January 2000), plus several other databases. We handsearched journals, reference lists of articles and contacted selected authors and manufacturers. Randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials with blind outcome assessment, comparing fluoride varnish, gel, mouthrinse, or toothpaste with each other in children up to 16 years during at least 1 year. The main outcome was caries increment measured by the change in decayed, missing and filled tooth surfaces (D(M)FS). Inclusion decisions, quality assessment and data extraction were duplicated in a random sample of one third of studies, and consensus achieved by discussion or a third party. Authors were contacted for missing data. The primary measure of effect was the prevented fraction (PF) that is the difference in mean caries increments between the 'experimental' and 'control' groups expressed as a percentage of the mean increment in the control group. Random effects meta-analyses were performed where data could be pooled. There were 17 studies included, and 15 contributed data for the meta-analyses. Fluoride toothpaste was not significantly different from mouthrinse (pooled DMFS PF 0%; 95% CI, -18% to 19%; p = 0.94), or gel (pooled DMFS PF 0%; 95% CI, -21% to 21%; p = 1), or both gel and mouthrinse (pooled DMFS PF 1%; 95% CI, -13% to 14%; p = 0.94); heterogeneity was substantial. Results from the single trial comparing toothpaste with varnish (in deciduous teeth) were inconclusive (dfs PF 5%; CI not obtainable). The pooled results from the comparisons of fluoride varnish with mouthrinse was a non-significant difference favouring varnish (DMFS PF 10%; 95% CI, -12% to 32%; p = 0.40), but this result was not robust to sensitivity analysis performed, and heterogeneity was considerable. Results from the single trial comparing varnish with gel (14%, 95% CI, -12% to 40%; p = 0.30) and the single trial comparing gel with mouthrinse (-14% DMFS PF; 95% CI, -40% to 12%; p = 0.30) were inconclusive (favoured varnish and mouthrinse respectively). Fluoride toothpastes in comparison to mouthrinses or gels appear to have a similar degree of effectiveness for the prevention of dental caries in children. There is no clear suggestion that fluoride varnish is more effective than mouthrinses and the evidence for the comparative effectiveness of fluoride varnishes and gels, and mouthrinses and gels is inconclusive. No conclusions about adverse effects could be reached, because no data were reported on in the trials. Acceptance is likely to be greater for fluoride toothpaste.",Another Cochrane review found 17 randomized controlled trials comparing different methods of topical fluoride application in children. The limited data suggested that fluoride toothpaste is as effective as mouth rinse or gel.
"Can infants/toddlers get enough fluoride through brushing
Topical fluoride therapy (TFT) in the form of varnish, gel, mouthrinse or toothpaste has been used extensively as a caries-preventive intervention for over three decades. To determine the effectiveness and safety of fluoride varnishes, gels, mouthrinses, and toothpastes in the prevention of dental caries in children and to examine factors potentially modifying their effect. We searched the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (May 2000), CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2000), MEDLINE (1966 to January 2000), plus several other databases. We handsearched journals, reference lists of articles and contacted selected authors and manufacturers. Randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials with blind outcome assessment, comparing fluoride varnish, gel, mouthrinse, or toothpaste with placebo or no treatment in children up to 16 years during at least 1 year. The main outcome was caries increment measured by the change in decayed, missing and filled tooth surfaces (D(M)FS). Inclusion decisions, quality assessment and data extraction were duplicated in a random sample of one third of studies, and consensus achieved by discussion or a third party. Authors were contacted for missing data. The primary measure of effect was the prevented fraction (PF) that is the difference in mean caries increments between the treatment and control groups expressed as a percentage of the mean increment in the control group. Random effects meta-analyses were performed where data could be pooled. Potential sources of heterogeneity were examined in random effects metaregression analyses. There were 144 studies included. For the 133 that contributed data for meta-analysis (involving 65,169 children) the D(M)FS pooled prevented fraction estimate was 26% (95% CI, 24% to 29%; p < 0.0001). There was substantial heterogeneity, confirmed statistically (p < 0.0001), but the direction of effect was consistent. The effect of topical fluoride varied according to type of control group used, type of TFT used, mode/setting of TFT use, initial caries levels and intensity of TFT application, but was not influenced by exposure to water fluoridation or other fluoride sources. D(M)FS PF was on average 14% (95% CI, 5% to 23%; p = 0.002) higher in non-placebo controlled trials, 14% (95% CI, 2% to 26%; p = 0.25) higher in fluoride varnish trials compared with all others, and 10% (95% CI, -17% to -3%; p = 0.003) lower in trials of unsupervised home use compared with self applied supervised and operator-applied. There was a 0.7% increase in the PF per unit increase in baseline caries (95% CI, 0.2% to 1.2%; p = 0.004). The benefits of topical fluorides have been firmly established on a sizeable body of evidence from randomized controlled trials. While the formal examination of sources of heterogeneity between studies has been important in the overall conclusions reached, these should be interpreted with caution. We were unable to reach definite conclusions about any adverse effects that might result from the use of topical fluorides, because data reported in the trials are scarce.","A large Cochrane review evaluated topical fluoride therapy in the form of toothpaste, mouth rinse, varnish, or gel. Based on 133 randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials (n=65,169), the meta-analysis indicated a 26% (95% confidence interval [CI], 24%-29%) reduction in decayed, missing, and filled tooth surfaces in children."
"Does the age you introduce food to an infant affect allergies later
In infants with a family history of atopy, food allergen avoidance has been advocated as means of preventing the development of atopic disease when breast-feeding is not possible or supplemental feeding is needed. Most infant formulas are based on cow's milk protein. Alternative choices include soya based and hydrolysed cows milk formulas. To estimate the effect of dietary avoidance of cow's milk protein on the development of asthma or wheeze in children. The Cochrane database was searched for eligible trials until February 2002. The full text papers of all abstracts identified as RCTs were obtained and reviewed independently by two reviewers. Randomised controlled trials involving children with a family history of atopy in at least one first degree relative were considered if feeding with cow's milk based standard formula was compared to dietary avoidance of cow's milk protein using soya or other hypoallergenic formula during the initial four months of life or longer. Two reviewers extracted data independently. A priori defined subgroups were the types of hypoallergenic artificial feed and dietary restrictions on mother and/or child's diet. Six trials used hydrolysed formula for at least 4 months in addition to dietary restrictions and in some cases dust-mite reduction measures. The risk of infants experiencing asthma or wheeze during the first year of life was reduced compared to standard cow's milk based formula (Relative Risk =0.40, 95% Confidence Intervals 0.19, 0.85). Feeding soya-based formula as opposed to standard cow's milk formula did not reduce the risk of having asthma or wheeze at any age. Breast-milk should remain the feed of choice for all babies. In infants with at least one first degree relative with atopy, hydrolysed formula for a minimum of 4 months combined with dietary restrictions and environment measures may reduce the risk of developing asthma or wheeze in the first year of life. There is insufficient evidence to suggest that soya-based milk formula has any benefit.",The relative risk for wheeze or asthma in the first year of life was 0.4 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.19-0.85) for children fed hydrolyzed protein formulas when compared with cow's milk.
"Should we use SSRIs to treat adolescents with depression
Initial treatment of major depressive disorder in adolescents may include cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). However, little is known about their relative or combined effectiveness. To evaluate the effectiveness of 4 treatments among adolescents with major depressive disorder. Randomized controlled trial of a volunteer sample of 439 patients between the ages of 12 to 17 years with a primary Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, diagnosis of major depressive disorder. The trial was conducted at 13 US academic and community clinics between spring 2000 and summer 2003. Twelve weeks of (1) fluoxetine alone (10 to 40 mg/d), (2) CBT alone, (3) CBT with fluoxetine (10 to 40 mg/d), or (4) placebo (equivalent to 10 to 40 mg/d). Placebo and fluoxetine alone were administered double-blind; CBT alone and CBT with fluoxetine were administered unblinded. Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised total score and, for responder analysis, a (dichotomized) Clinical Global Impressions improvement score. Compared with placebo, the combination of fluoxetine with CBT was statistically significant (P =.001) on the Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised. Compared with fluoxetine alone (P =.02) and CBT alone (P =.01), treatment of fluoxetine with CBT was superior. Fluoxetine alone is a superior treatment to CBT alone (P =.01). Rates of response for fluoxetine with CBT were 71.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], 62%-80%); fluoxetine alone, 60.6% (95% CI, 51%-70%); CBT alone, 43.2% (95% CI, 34%-52%); and placebo, 34.8% (95% CI, 26%-44%). On the Clinical Global Impressions improvement responder analysis, the 2 fluoxetine-containing conditions were statistically superior to CBT and to placebo. Clinically significant suicidal thinking, which was present in 29% of the sample at baseline, improved significantly in all 4 treatment groups. Fluoxetine with CBT showed the greatest reduction (P =.02). Seven (1.6%) of 439 patients attempted suicide; there were no completed suicides. The combination of fluoxetine with CBT offered the most favorable tradeoff between benefit and risk for adolescents with major depressive disorder.","A large, multicenter, randomized controlled trial evaluated the effectiveness of fluoxetine (Prozac), cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), or the combination of the 2. Researchers evaluated improvement with the Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised (CDRSR). The CDRS-R uses adolescent and parent interviews to rate 17 symptom areas: impaired schoolwork, difficulty having fun, social withdrawal, appetite disturbance, sleep disturbance, excessive fatigue, physical complaints, irritability, excessive guilt, low self-esteem, depressed feelings, morbid ideas, suicidal ideas, excessive weeping, depressed facial affect, listless speech, and hypoactivity. Combination treatment with fluoxetine and CBT was statistically superior to placebo, CBT alone, or fluoxetine alone. In addition, fluoxetine alone was superior to CBT alone."
"Should we use SSRIs to treat adolescents with depression
There has been concern that widely used antidepressant agents might be associated with an increased risk of suicidal ideation and behavior (suicidality) in pediatric patients. To investigate the relationship between antidepressant drugs and suicidality in pediatric patients participating in randomized, placebo-controlled trials. Data were derived from 23 trials conducted in 9 drug company-supported programs evaluating the effectiveness of antidepressants in pediatric patients and 1 multicenter trial (the Treatment for Adolescents With Depression Study) that evaluated fluoxetine hydrochloride. All placebo-controlled trials submitted to the Food and Drug Administration were eligible for inclusion. Evaluable data were derived from 4582 patients in 24 trials. Sixteen trials studied patients with major depressive disorder, and the remaining 8 studied obsessive-compulsive disorder (n = 4), generalized anxiety disorder (n = 2), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (n = 1), and social anxiety disorder (n = 1). Only 20 trials were included in the risk ratio analysis of suicidality because 4 trials had no events in the drug or placebo groups. Individual patient data were available for all the trials. A meta-analysis was conducted to obtain overall suicidality risk estimates for each drug individually, for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in depression trials as a group, and for all evaluable trials combined. There were no completed suicides in any of these trials. The multicenter trial was the only individual trial to show a statistically significant risk ratio (4.62; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-20.92). The overall risk ratio for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in depression trials was 1.66 (95% CI, 1.02-2.68) and for all drugs across all indications was 1.95 (95% CI, 1.28-2.98). The overall risk difference for all drugs across all indications was 0.02 (95% CI, 0.01-0.03). Use of antidepressant drugs in pediatric patients is associated with a modestly increased risk of suicidality.","In 2004, the FDA conducted a meta-analysis of the suicide related adverse events from the published and unpublished trials of SSRIs including fluoxetine, sertraline, paroxetine, fluvoxamine (Luvox), and citalopram. A team of experts reviewed the adverse events from each trial to evaluate for suicidality including suicidal ideation, preparatory acts, self-injurious behavior, or suicide attempts. They found a risk ratio of 1.66 (95% confidence interval, 1.02-2.68) for suicidality in the treatment arms compared with placebo. There were no completed suicides in any study."
"What's the best treatment for gestational diabetes
Women with gestational diabetes mellitus are rarely treated with a sulfonylurea drug, because of concern about teratogenicity and neonatal hypoglycemia. There is little information about the efficacy of these drugs in this group of women. We studied 404 women with singleton pregnancies and gestational diabetes that required treatment. The women were randomly assigned between 11 and 33 weeks of gestation to receive glyburide or insulin according to an intensified treatment protocol. The primary end point was achievement of the desired level of glycemic control. Secondary end points included maternal and neonatal complications. The mean (+/-SD) pretreatment blood glucose concentration as measured at home for one week was 114+/-19 mg per deciliter (6.4+/-1.1 mmol per liter) in the glyburide group and 116+/-22 mg per deciliter (6.5+/-1.2 mmol per liter) in the insulin group (P=0.33). The mean concentrations during treatment were 105+/-16 mg per deciliter (5.9+/-0.9 mmol per liter) in the glyburide group and 105+/-18 mg per deciliter (5.9+/-1.0 mmol per liter) in the insulin group (P=0.99). Eight women in the glyburide group (4 percent) required insulin therapy. There were no significant differences between the glyburide and insulin groups in the percentage of infants who were large for gestational age (12 percent and 13 percent, respectively); who had macrosomia, defined as a birth weight of 4000 g or more (7 percent and 4 percent); who had lung complications (8 percent and 6 percent); who had hypoglycemia (9 percent and 6 percent); who were admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit (6 percent and 7 percent); or who had fetal anomalies (2 percent and 2 percent). The cord-serum insulin concentrations were similar in the two groups, and glyburide was not detected in the cord serum of any infant in the glyburide group. In women with gestational diabetes, glyburide is a clinically effective alternative to insulin therapy.","A high-quality randomized controlled trial comparing glyburide with insulin among 404 women found no difference in maternal hypoglycemia, neonatal mortality, or neonatal features and outcomes (including birthweight, NICU admissions, hyperbilirubinemia, and hypoglycemia; P ≥.25). Although this was a fairly large trial, it may have been underpowered since it found small differences in such rare outcomes."
"Should we use appetite stimulants for malnourished elderly patients
To provide preliminary evidence on the effectiveness and optimal dosage of megestrol acetate for older persons with impaired appetite after hospitalization. Randomized clinical trial. Acute care hospital. Forty-seven older persons (mean age 83) who were recently discharged from an acute care hospital and had fair or poor appetite. Participants were randomized to placebo or megestrol acetate suspension 200 mg, 400 mg, or 800 mg daily for 9 weeks. Appetite, health-related quality of life, and adverse effects were measured at baseline and 20, 42, and 63 days. Serum nutritional markers were measured at baseline and 20 and 63 days. During the course of the study, there were no significant differences between treatment groups on any of the appetite questions, although participants in the 400-mg and 800-mg groups demonstrated significant improvement from baseline on some questions. At 20 days, prealbumin increased in a dose-response relationship across the four groups (by 0.4, 5.1, 7.5, and 9.0 mg/dL, respectively). Participants in the 400-mg and 800-mg groups demonstrated greater improvement in prealbumin levels at 20 days than those receiving placebo (P=.009 and P=.004, respectively) and those in the 400-mg group also demonstrated improvement at 63 days (P=.02). At 20 days, no participant taking placebo had a morning serum cortisol level less than 8 ng/mL (the lower limit of normal). In contrast, 33%, 70%, and 78% of those taking 200 mg, 400 mg and 800 mg, respectively, had values below this level; by 63 days, these percentages were 11%, 30%, 56%, and 37%, respectively. No patient reported clinical symptoms of adrenal insufficiency. Diarrhea developed in three subjects, and thromboembolism occurred in two receiving active treatment. Megestrol acetate at doses of 400 mg and 800 mg increases prealbumin in recently hospitalized older persons. Cortisol suppression is common at higher doses and may be persistent. In this small study, the drug did not confer benefit on other nutritional or clinical outcomes.","One placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial studied 45 malnourished patients who were recently discharged from an acute care hospital to a nursing home. The patients (predominately female, with a mean age of 83) were randomized into 4 treatment arms (placebo or megestrol 200 mg, 400 mg, or 800 mg daily) and followed for 63 days. Only those receiving megestrol (400 mg or 800 mg daily) demonstrated a statistically significant increase in patient appetite and a dose-responsive increase in prealbumin level at the 20 day interim analysis (7.5 and 9.0 mg/dL, respectfully). But at the final assessment (63 days), only the 400-mg dose maintained a statistically significant increase in prealbumin over placebo. However, there was no significant improvement in serum albumin or clinical endpoints (weight, functional status, or health-related quality of life)."
"What test is the best for diagnosing infectious mononucleosis
Ten microbiological departments in Norway have participated in a multicenter evaluation of the following commercial tests for detection of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-specific and heterophile antibodies: CAPTIA Select viral capsid antigen (VCA)-M/G/EBNA (Centocor Inc.), Enzygnost anti-EBV/immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG (Dade Behring), Vironostika EBV VCA IgM/IgG/EBNA enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (Organon Teknika), SEROFLUOR immunofluorescence assay and EBV Combi-Test (Institute Virion Ltd.), anti-EBV recombinant IgM- and IgG-early antigen/EBNA IgG ELISA (Biotest Diagnostics), EBV IgM/IgG/EBNA ELISA (Gull Laboratories), Paul-Bunnell-Davidsohn test (Sanofi Diagnostics Pasteur), Monosticon Dri-Dot (Organon Teknika), Avitex-IM (Omega Diagnostics Ltd.), Alexon Serascan infectious mononucleosis test (Alexon Biomedical Inc. ), Clearview IM (Unipath Ltd.), and Cards+/-OS Mono (Pacific Biotech, Inc.). The test panel included sera from patients with primary EBV infection, immunocompromised patients with recent cytomegalovirus infection, healthy persons (blood donors), and EBV-seronegative persons. Among the tests for EBV-specific antibodies the sensitivity was good, with only small differences between the different assays. However, there was a greater variation in specificity, which varied between 100% (Enzygnost) and 86% (Biotest). Tests for detection of heterophile antibodies based on purified or selected antigen (Avitex, Alexon, Clearview IM, and Cards+/-OS Mono) were more sensitive than the Paul-Bunnell-Davidsohn and Monosticon tests.",A validating cohort study assessed the sensitivity and specificity of 6 commercial test kits for detection of Epstein-Barr virus-specific antibodies (EBVCA and EBNA). The study compared antibody levels in 139 serum specimens from patients with recent primary EBV infections (confirmed by both a positive heterophile antibody test and an EBV antibody pattern compatible with recent infection) and in 40 specimens from healthy normal controls. The average sensitivity of the antibody tests was 97% (95%-99%) and average specificity was 94% (86%-100%).

Tests for detection of heterophile antibodies based on purified or selected antigen (Avitex, Alexon, Clearview IM, and Cards+/-OS Mono) were more sensitive than the Paul-Bunnell-Davidsohn and Monosticon tests.",The second study used a similar method to test 6 more heterophile kits using blood samples from 140 patients.
"What are appropriate screening tests for infants and children
Amblyopia is a reversible deficit of vision that has to be treated within the sensitive period for visual development. Screening programmes have been set up to detect this largely asymptomatic condition and refer children for treatment while an improvement in vision is still possible. The value of such programmes and the optimum protocol for administering them remain controversial. The objective of this review was to evaluate the effectiveness of vision screening in reducing the prevalence of amblyopia. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register, on The Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2005, MEDLINE (1966 to May 2005 week 1) and EMBASE (1980 to 2005 week 19). No language restrictions were placed on these searches. No handsearching was done. We planned to analyse data from randomised controlled trials and cluster-randomised trials comparing the prevalence of amblyopia in screened versus unscreened populations. Two authors independently assessed study abstracts identified by the electronic searches. Full text copies of appropriate studies were obtained and, where necessary, authors were contacted. No data were available for analysis and no meta-analysis was performed. Despite the large amount of literature available regarding vision screening no trials designed to compare the prevalence of amblyopia in screened versus unscreened populations were found. Data currently under preparation may be available for updates to the review. The lack of data from randomised controlled trials makes it difficult to analyse the impact of existing screening programmes on the prevalence of amblyopia. The absence of such evidence cannot be taken to mean that vision screening is not beneficial; simply that this intervention has not yet been tested in robust trials. To facilitate such trials normative data on age-appropriate vision tests need to be available and a consensus reached regarding the definition of amblyopia. In addition, the consequences of living with untreated amblyopia have yet to be quantified and a cost-benefit analysis carried out.",One fair-quality controlled study (N=3490) showed a decreased prevalence of amblyopia in the screened group and evidence that treatment of amblyotic risk factors prevents amblyopia.
"What is the most beneficial diet for patients with diverticulosis
Epidemiological and anatomic evidence indicates that approximately 60% of humans of westernized societies living into the sixth decade will develop diverticulosis of the colon. The cause remains unknown, but epidemiological studies indicate it is a combination of decreased dietary fiber intake and increased intracolonic pressure. The intraluminal pressure exerted on the wall causes a diverticular outpocketing at any one of the three areas in which vessels enter the wall. In this paper, we advance a hypothesis that fiber deficiency not only leads to diverticula formation but also causes a change in the microecology that results in decreased colon immune response and permits a low-grade chronic inflammatory process that precedes a full-blown acute diverticulitis. Pathophysiologic studies reveal that complications do not occur until there is microperforation through the wall of the diverticulum into the pericolic tissue. The perforation might be small and cause a microabscess, or extend to a phlegmon, or extend to a large abscess formation. Free perforation occurs rarely, but fistulization does occur and most commonly to the bladder. The clinical findings vary. Most often, the clinical picture is one of fever, abdominal pain, a change in bowel habit, and localizing findings associated with leukocytosis. Computerized tomography scanning has become the procedure of choice to evaluate the symptoms since it is of less risk than a barium enema and obtains more information. The differential diagnosis may be difficult but usually can be made with accuracy. Medical treatment is preferred with appropriate antibiotic therapy and variations in fiber intake. When abscess occurs, percutaneous drainage may be tried, but when it is unsuccessful, surgical intervention is necessary. Sudden hemorrhage from a vessel in diverticula may also occur. It is estimated that approximately 20% of all patients that develop diverticula will have either inflammatory or bleeding episodes. In conclusion, fiber deficiency results in diverticular formation and a chronic inflammation that may progress to acute or chronic diverticulitis that can be treated medically but may require surgical intervention.","Approximately 60% of people living in Westernized countries who are older than 60 years will develop diverticulosis of the colon. Colonic diverticuli are thought to develop from an increase in intraluminal pressure. This pressure can be caused by colonic motility abnormalities, but a low-fiber diet can also result in a smaller stool mass and a less distended colon, thereby increasing intraluminal pressure."
"What is the most beneficial diet for patients with diverticulosis
Forty patients with diverticular disease were treated with wheat bran 24g/day for at least six months. Thirty-three patients showed a very satisfactory clinical response. Sixty per cent of all symptoms were abolished, and a further 28% were relieved. After treatment the transit times accelerated in patients whose initial times were slower than 60 hours and slowed down in those whose initial transit times were faster than 36 hours. Stool weight increased significantly. The number of intracolonic high pressure waves decreased, especially during and after eating. Barium enema studies showed less spasm in eight patients and no diverticula in three patients after taking bran. As well as relieving the symptoms of diverticular disease a high-fibre diet may also prevent the condition from developing.",A small case series of adults treated with dietary fiber found that fiber alleviated symptoms of diverticular disease.
"What is the most beneficial diet for patients with diverticulosis
The management of diverticular disease has altered radically with the widespread use of high fibre diet (HFD) over the past decade. However, whether this regimen has improved the prognosis in patients admitted with acute complications is still debatable. In this study the outcome of 100 such patients admitted to hospital with acute episodes of diverticular disease has been reviewed. Seventy-five per cent were treated conservatively with HFD and review after 5--7 years showed that over 90 per cent remained symptom-free, suggesting that HFD may afford protection by preventing further complications.",A small case series of adults treated with dietary fiber found that fiber possibly reduced complications of diverticulosis.
"What is the most beneficial diet for patients with diverticulosis
Fifty-eight patients with uncomplicated diverticular disease of the colon took bran crispbread, ispaghula drink, and placebo for four months each in a randomised, cross-over, double-blind controlled trial. Assessments were made subjectively, using a monthly self-administered questionnaire, and objectively, by examining a seven-day stool collection at the end of each treatment period. In terms of a pain score, lower bowel symptom score (the pain score and sensation of incomplete emptying, straining, stool consistency, flatus, and aperients taken), and total symptom score (belching, nausea, vomiting, dyspepsia, and abdominal distension) fibre supplementation conferred no benefit. Symptoms of constipation, however, when assessed alone, were significantly relieved. Both fibre regimens produced the expected changes in stool weight, consistency, and frequency. It is concluded that dietary fibre supplements in the commonly used doses do no more than relieve constipation. Perhaps the impression that fibre helps diverticular disease is simply a manifestation of Western civilisation's obsession with the need for regular frequent defecation.","Another study found no significant differences between psyllium, bran, and placebo in reducing symptomatic diverticular disease."
"Who should have colposcopy
To evaluate the accuracy of conventional and new methods of Papanicolaou (Pap) testing when used to detect cervical cancer and its precursors. Systematic search of English-language literature through October 1999 using MEDLINE, EMBASE, other computerized databases, and hand searching. All studies that compared Pap testing (conventional methods, computer screening or rescreening, or monolayer cytology) with a concurrent reference standard (histologic examination, colposcopy, or cytology). Two reviewers independently reviewed selection criteria and completed 2 x 2 tables for each study. 94 studies of the conventional Pap test and three studies of monolayer cytology met inclusion criteria. No studies of computerized screening were included. Data were organized by cytologic and histologic thresholds used to define disease. For conventional Pap tests, estimates of sensitivity and specificity varied greatly in individual studies. Methodologic quality and frequency of histologic abnormalities also varied greatly between studies. In the 12 studies with the least biased estimates, sensitivity ranged from 30% to 87% and specificity ranged from 86% to 100%. Insufficient high-quality data exist to estimate test operating characteristics of new cytologic methods for cervical screening. Future studies of these technologies should apply adequate reference standards. Most studies of the conventional Pap test are severely biased: The best estimates suggest that it is only moderately accurate and does not achieve concurrently high sensitivity and specificity. Cost-effectiveness models of cervical cancer screening should use more conservative estimates of Pap test sensitivity.","While most lesions are found by abnormal cytology, the sensitivity of the Papanicolaou smear ranges from 30% to 89%."
"What are the indications for meningococcal vaccination
The US Food and Drug Administration approved a meningococcal conjugate A/C/Y/W-135 vaccine (MCV-4) for use in persons aged 11 to 55 years in January, 2005; licensure for use in younger age groups is expected in 2 to 4 years. To evaluate and compare the projected health and economic impact of MCV-4 vaccination of US adolescents, toddlers, and infants. Cost-effectiveness analysis from a societal perspective based on data from Active Bacterial Core Surveillance (ABCs) and other published and unpublished sources. Sensitivity analyses in which key input measures were varied over plausible ranges were performed. A hypothetical 2003 US population cohort of children 11 years of age and a 2003 US birth cohort. Hypothetical routine vaccination of adolescents (1 dose at 11 years of age), toddlers (1 dose at 1 year of age), and infants (3 doses at 2, 4, and 6 months of age). Each vaccination scenario was compared with a ""no-vaccination"" scenario. Meningococcal cases and deaths prevented, cost per case prevented, cost per life-year saved, and cost per quality-adjusted life-year saved. Routine MCV-4 vaccination of US adolescents (11 years of age) would prevent 270 meningococcal cases and 36 deaths in the vaccinated cohort over 22 years, a decrease of 46% in the expected burden of disease. Before program costs are counted, adolescent vaccination would reduce direct disease costs by $18 million and decrease productivity losses by $50 million. At a cost per vaccination (average public-private price per dose plus administration fees) of $82.50, adolescent vaccination would cost society $633000 per meningococcal case prevented and $121000 per life-year saved. Key variables influencing results were disease incidence, case-fatality ratio, and cost per vaccination. The cost-effectiveness of toddler vaccination is essentially equivalent to adolescent vaccination, whereas infant vaccination would be much less cost-effective. Routine MCV-4 vaccination of US children would reduce the burden of disease in vaccinated cohorts but at a relatively high net societal cost. The projected cost-effectiveness of adolescent vaccination approaches that of recently adopted childhood vaccines under conditions of above-average meningococcal disease incidence or at a lower cost per vaccination.","Using CDC incidence data, a cost-effectiveness model compared hypothetical vaccination strategies targeting US infants (3 doses), toddlers (1 dose), or 11-year-olds (1 dose). Routine MCV4 vaccination of all 11-year-olds would prevent 270 cases and 36 deaths in this cohort over their next 22 years. For a toddler cohort, vaccination would prevent 385 cases and 33 deaths; for infants, 447 cases and 36 deaths. Conjugate meningococcal vaccines for serogroups A and C have been tested and used in children in other countries, and appear safe and effective, but are not yet available in the US. An application has been submitted for FDA approval of MCV4 for 2- to 10-year-olds."
"What are the indications for meningococcal vaccination
To estimate the extent of meningococcal carriage in the Norwegian population and to investigate the relationship of several characteristics of the population to the carrier state, 1,500 individuals living in rural and small-town areas near Oslo were selected at random from the Norwegian National Population Registry. These persons were asked to complete a questionnaire and to volunteer for a bacteriological tonsillopharyngeal swab sampling. Sixty-three percent of the selected persons participated in the survey. Ninety-one (9.6%) of the volunteers harbored Neisseria meningitidis. The isolates were serogrouped, serotyped, tested for antibiotic resistance, and analyzed by multilocus enzyme electrophoresis. Eight (8.8%) of the 91 isolates represented clones of the two clone complexes that have been responsible for most of the systemic meningococal disease in Norway in the 1980s. Age between 15 and 24, male sex, and active and passive smoking were found to be independently associated with meningococcal carriage in logistic regression analyses. Working outside the home and having an occupation in transportation or industry also increased the risk for meningococcal carriage in individuals older than 17, when corrections for gender and smoking were made. Assuming that our sample is representative of the Norwegian population, we estimated that about 40,000 individuals in Norway are asymptomatic carriers of isolates with epidemic potential. Thus, carriage eradication among close contacts of persons with systemic disease is unlikely to have a significant impact on the overall epidemiological situation.","Vaccinating adolescents may be particularly helpful for building herd immunity. A Norwegian study of nasopharyngeal meningococcal carriage among 943 unimmunized individuals ages 2 months to 95 years found a carriage rate of 28% among 15- to 24-year-olds, compared with 9.6% overall."

This report provides information regarding the modestly increased risk for meningococcal disease among college freshmen, particularly those who live in dormitories or residence halls. It presents recommendations developed by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices regarding the education of students and parents about meningococcal disease and the polysaccharide meningococcal vaccine so that they can make informed decisions regarding vaccination.","High hospitalization rates in US military recruits during 1964 to 1970 (25.2/100,000) led to the development of the meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine. Since 1971, all new military recruits have received polysaccharide meningococcal vaccine, and for the period 1990 to 1998 the hospitalization rate for meningococcal disease among active duty service members had decreased by 98% (to 0.51/100,000)."
"What is the role of prokinetic agents for constipation
The efficacy of erythromycin was assessed in the treatment of 14 children aged 4 to 13 years with refractory chronic constipation, and presenting megarectum and fecal impaction. A double-blind, placebo- controlled, crossover study was conducted at the Pediatric Gastroenterology Outpatient Clinic of the University Hospital. The patients were randomized to receive placebo for 4 weeks followed by erythromycin estolate, 20 mg kg-1 day-1, divided into four oral doses for another 4 weeks, or vice versa. Patient outcome was assessed according to a clinical score from 12 (most severe clinical condition) to 0 (complete recovery). At enrollment in the study and on the occasion of follow-up medical visits at two-week intervals, patient score and laxative requirements were recorded. During the first 30 days, the mean SD clinical score for the erythromycin group (N = 6) decreased from 8.2+/-2.3 to 2.2+/-1.0 while the score for the placebo group (N = 8) decreased from 7.8+/-2.1 to 2.9+/-2.8. During the second crossover phase, the score for patients on erythromycin ranged from 2.9+/-2.8 to 2.4+/-2.1 and the score for the patients on placebo worsened from 2.2+/-1.0 to 4.3+/-2.3. There was a significant improvement in score when patients were on erythromycin (P < 0.01). Mean laxative requirement was lower when patients ingested erythromycin (P < 0.05). No erythromycin-related side effects occurred. Erythromycin was useful in this group of severely constipated children. A larger trial is needed to fully ascertain the prokinetic efficacy of this drug as an adjunct in the treatment of severe constipation in children.",A small RCT of 14 children between 4 and 13 years of age showed that erythromycin improved symptoms of constipation and decreased laxative use (number needed to treat [NNT]=10).
"What is the role of prokinetic agents for constipation
Recent research has provided new information about drugs that could be used to treat functional motility disorders. Promotility drugs accelerate gastric emptying or colonic transit and these properties may contribute to their efficacy in treating symptoms associated with gastroparesis, functional dyspepsia or constipation. 5-Hydroxytryptamine4 receptors are targets for drugs (tegaserod, renzapride) that treat symptoms in constipated irritable bowel syndrome patients and in gastroparesis. Drugs acting at motilin (erythromycin) and cholecystokinin-1 (dexloxiglumide) receptors accelerate gastric emptying. Dexloxiglumide might be useful in the treatment of functional dyspepsia particularly that associated with lipid intake. Alvimopan is a mu-opioid receptor antagonist that does not cross the blood brain barrier. Alvimopan is effective in treating postsurgical ileus and perhaps opiate-induced bowel dysfunction. Successes and failures of recent efforts to develop promotility agents revealed opportunities and challenges for developing new promotility drugs. The pharmacological properties of partial agonists might be exploited to develop effective promotility drugs. However, opposing actions of promotility agents on motility (increased contraction vs decreased accommodation) limit the clinical efficacy of drugs with these opposing actions. Selection of appropriate patient populations for evaluation of new drugs is also critical.","Renzapride, a newer prokinetic similar to cisapride, is under investigation. It is one tenth the strength of cisapride and carries a lower potential risk of cardiac complications."
"Do abnormal fetal kick counts predict intrauterine death in average-risk pregnancies
Fetal death is a tragedy for mother, family, and obstetrician. Recent reviews of fetal death indicate that nearly half occur in pregnancies that are not candidates for traditional antepartum testing. We conducted a prospective evaluation of the effectiveness of a fetal movement screening program in reducing the fetal mortality rate. During a 7-month control period, 2519 deliveries occurred, no formal fetal movement assessment was done, and the fetal mortality rate was 8.7 per 1000 births. A pilot study was conducted to validate a protocol in which the patient was instructed to record the elapsed time required to appreciate 10 fetal movements. The mean time interval was 20.9 +/- 18.1 minutes (mean +/- SD). Patients in whom 2 hours elapsed without 10 fetal movements (mean +/- 5 SD) were to report to the delivery unit for further evaluation. During the study period, 1864 patients were delivered of infants and the fetal mortality rate was 2.1 per 1000 (chi 2 = 6.8, p less than 0.01). During the study period the number of antepartum tests performed increased by 13%. Interventions for fetal compromise prompted by inadequate fetal activity tripled in the study period, resulting in a drop in fetal mortality among patients with decreased movement from 44 to 10 per 1000. We conclude that the count-to-10 fetal movement screening program is simple and effective in reducing the fetal mortality rate.","A prospective cohort study of 4383 births in California, using historical controls, found a drop in fetal mortality from 8.7 to 2.1 deaths/1000. The historical control rate was higher than statewide data from the same time period, however. The overall weaker design of the study and probable effect of regression to the mean significantly limit the interpretation of outcomes."
"Can you differentiate bacterial from viral pediatric infections based on the CBC
Occult pneumococcal bacteremia (OPB) occurs in 2.5% to 3% of highly febrile children 3 to 36 months of age, and 10% to 25% of untreated patients with OPB experience complications, including 3% to 6% in whom meningitis develops. The purpose of this study was to identify predictors of OPB among a large cohort of young, febrile children treated as outpatients using multivariable statistical methods. We derived and validated a logistic regression model for the prediction of OPB. We evaluated 6,579 outpatients 3 to 36 months of age with temperatures of 39 degrees C or higher who previously had been enrolled in a study of young febrile patients at risk of OPB in the emergency departments of 10 hospitals in the United States between 1987 and 1991; 164 patients (2.5%) had OPB. We randomly selected two thirds of this population for the derivation of the model and one third for validation. In the derivation set, we analyzed the univariate relationships of six variables with OPB: age, temperature, clinical score, WBC count, absolute neutrophil count (ANC), and absolute band count (ABC). All six variables were then entered into a logistic regression equation and those retaining statistical significance were considered to have an independent association with OPB. Patients with OPB were younger, more frequently ill-appearing, and had higher temperatures, WBC, ANC, and ABC than patients without bacteremia. Only three variables, however, retained statistically significant associations with OPB in the multivariate analysis: ANC (Adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.15 for each 1,000 cells/mm3 increase, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.06, 1.25), temperature (adjusted OR 1.77 for each 1 degree C increase, 95% CI 1.21, 2.58), and age younger than 2 years (adjusted OR 2.43 versus patients 2 to 3 years old, 95% CI interval 1.11, 5.34). In the derivation set, 8.1% of patients with ANCs greater than or equal to 10,000 cell/mm3 had OPB (95% CI 6.3, 10.1%) versus .8% of patients with ANCs less than 10,000 cells/mm3 (95% CI .5, 1.2%). When tested on the validation set, the model performed similarly. Independent predictors of OPB in children 3 to 36 months of age with temperatures of 39 degrees C or higher treated as outpatients include ANC, temperature, and age younger than 2 years. These predictors may be used to develop clinical strategies to limit laboratory testing and antibiotic administration to those children at greatest risk of OPB.","A review of 6579 outpatients aged 3 to 36 months presenting to the emergency department with temperatures of 39ºC or higher showed an ANC of >10,000/mm3 as more predictive of occult pneumococcal bacteremia than an elevated WBC count (>15,000/mm3) alone."

"Which healthy adults should take aspirin
This report presents final 1999 data on U.S. deaths and death rates according to demographic and medical characteristics. Trends and patterns in general mortality, life expectancy, and infant and maternal mortality are also described. A previous report presented preliminary mortality data for 1999. In 1999 a total of 2,391,399 deaths were reported in the United States. This report presents tabulations of information reported on the death certificates completed by funeral directors, attending physicians, medical examiners, and coroners. Original records are filed in the State registration offices. Statistical information is compiled into a national data base through the Vital Statistics Cooperative Program of the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. For the first time in a final mortality data report, age-adjusted death rates are based upon the year 2000 population and causes of death are processed in accordance with the Tenth Revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10). The 1999 age-adjusted death rate for the United States was 881.9 deaths per 100,000 standard population, a 0.7 percent increase from the 1998 rate, and life expectancy at birth remained the same at 76.7 years. For all causes of death, age-specific death rates rose for those 45-54 years, 75-84 years, and 85 years and over and declined for a number of age groups including those 5-14 years, 55-64 years, and 65-74 years. Aortic aneurysm and dissection made its debut in the list of leading causes of death and atherosclerosis exited from the list. Heart disease and cancer continued to be the leading and second leading causes of death. The age-adjusted death rate for firearm injuries decreased for the sixth consecutive year, declining 6.2 percent between 1998 and 1999. The infant mortality rate, 7.1 infant deaths per 1,000 live births, was not statistically different from the rate in 1998. Generally, mortality continued long-term trends. Life expectancy in 1999 was unchanged from 1998 despite a slight increase in the age-adjusted death rate from the record low achieved in 1998. Although statistically unchanged from 1998, the trend in infant mortality has been of a steady but slowing decline. Some mortality measures for women and persons 85 years and over worsened between 1998 and 1999.","Because only 2 trials included women, it is less clear whether both sexes benefit equally from aspirin prophylaxis"
"What medications are safe and effective for heartburn during pregnancy
A randomized controlled trial was performed to study the efficacy of Syn-Ergel with an active placebo in the treatment of heartburn of pregnancy in ninety-two patients completing 7 days of therapy. Syn-Ergel was significantly better (p less than 0.001) in all groups of pre-treatment pain severity in relieving the symptoms, and had a longer duration of action, than the active placebo. Complete relief of pain was achieved in 79.5% of Syn-Ergel treatments with a further 10% of treatments resulting in marked easing of discomfort at 1 hour following administration. The corresponding figures for the 'active placebo' were 56% and 20%. The combination of an antacid and a protective mucosal coating agent would appear to be a useful approach in the treatment of heartburn of pregnacy.",Aluminum phosphate more frequently produced complete relief of moderate to severe heartburn at 60 minutes compared with placebo (P <.001; number needed to treat [NNT] = 2.1 for mild heartburn and 20 for severe).
"In patients with a previous CVA, do antioxidants protect against subsequent stroke
Observational and experimental studies suggest that the amount of vitamin E ingested in food and in supplements is associated with a lower risk of coronary heart disease and atherosclerosis. We enrolled a total of 2545 women and 6996 men 55 years of age or older who were at high risk for cardiovascular events because they had cardiovascular disease or diabetes in addition to one other risk factor. These patients were randomly assigned according to a two-by-two factorial design to receive either 400 IU of vitamin E daily from natural sources or matching placebo and either an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor (ramipril) or matching placebo for a mean of 4.5 years (the results of the comparison of ramipril and placebo are reported in a companion article). The primary outcome was a composite of myocardial infarction, stroke, and death from cardiovascular causes. The secondary outcomes included unstable angina, congestive heart failure, revascularization or amputation, death from any cause, complications of diabetes, and cancer. A total of 772 of the 4761 patients assigned to vitamin E (16.2 percent) and 739 of the 4780 assigned to placebo (15.5 percent) had a primary outcome event (relative risk, 1.05; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.95 to 1.16; P=0.33). There were no significant differences in the numbers of deaths from cardiovascular causes (342 of those assigned to vitamin E vs. 328 of those assigned to placebo; relative risk, 1.05; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.90 to 1.22), myocardial infarction (532 vs. 524; relative risk, 1.02; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.90 to 1.15), or stroke (209 vs. 180; relative risk, 1.17; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.95 to 1.42). There were also no significant differences in the incidence of secondary cardiovascular outcomes or in death from any cause. There were no significant adverse effects of vitamin E. In patients at high risk for cardiovascular events, treatment with vitamin E for a mean of 4.5 years had no apparent effect on cardiovascular outcomes.","The Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation HOPE trial was a 4.5-year randomized controlled clinical trial of vitamin E or placebo in 9541 patients aged 55 years or older with a history of coronary artery disease, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, or diabetes and other cardiovascular disease risk factors. No difference was noted between vitamin E and placebo for the outcomes of stroke, death, or other cardiac outcomes for these high-risk patients."
"What is the role of tacrolimus and pimecrolimus in atopic dermatitis
To compare the efficacy and safety of tacrolimus ointment and pimecrolimus cream in adult and pediatric patients with mild to very severe atopic dermatitis (AD). One thousand and sixty-five patients were randomized to treatment in 3 multicenter, randomized, investigator-blinded, 6-week studies. Based on the Eczema Area Severity Index (EASI), tacrolimus ointment was more effective than pimecrolimus cream at the end of the study in adults (54.1% vs. 34.9%, respectively; P < .0001), in children with moderate/severe disease (67.2% vs. 56.4%, respectively; P = .04), in the combined analysis (52.8% vs. 39.1%, respectively; P < .0001), and at week 1 in children with mild disease (39.2% vs. 31.2%, respectively; P = .04). Tacrolimus was also more effective than pimecrolimus based on the Investigator Global AD Assessment (IGADA), improvement in percentage of total body surface area affected, and improvement in itch scores (P < or = .05), with a faster onset of action. There was no significant difference in the incidence of adverse events (AEs), including application site reactions in the 2 studies involving 650 children. Adults treated with tacrolimus experienced a greater number of local application site reactions on day 1; both groups reported a similar incidence of application site reactions thereafter. More pimecrolimus-treated patients than tacrolimus-treated patients withdrew from the studies because of a lack of efficacy (P < or = .03) or adverse events (P = .002; pediatric mild). Tacrolimus ointment is more effective and has a faster onset of action than pimecrolimus cream in adults and children with AD; their safety profiles are similar.","In a meta-analysis of 3 randomized studies of head-to-head comparison of pimecrolimus 1% and tacrolimus 0.03% or 0.1% among children and adults, tacrolimus ointment was more effective than pimecrolimus cream at the end of the study for adults (P<.0001), for children with moderate-to-severe disease (P=.04), in the combined analysis (P<.0001), and at week 1 for children with mild disease (P=.04). No significant difference was seen in the incidence of adverse effects, although more pimecrolimus-treated patients withdrew from the studies because of a lack of efficacy (Pâ‰¤.03) or adverse events (P=.002; pediatric mild). The meta-analysis concluded that pimecrolimus 1% was more effective compared with placebo, less effective than potent topical corticosteroids, and had yet to be studied in comparison with low-potency topical corticosteroids. Tacrolimus 0.1% was more effective than placebo, more effective than mild corticosteroids, and as effective as potent topical corticosteroids. It was noted that both these agents caused more burning of the skin than topical corticosteroids-pimecrolimus 1% compared with betamethasone valerate 0.1% (number needed to harm [NNH]=50); tacrolimus 0.1% compared with betamethasone valerate 0.1% and hydrocortisone butyrate 0.1% (NNH=3); and tacrolimus 0.03% compared with the mild corticosteroid hydrocortisone acetate 1% (NNH=10)."
"Which tool is most useful in diagnosing bipolar disorder in children
To compare the diagnostic efficiency of six index tests as predictors of juvenile bipolar disorder in two large outpatient samples, aged 5 to 10 and 11 to 17 years, gathered from 1997 to 2002. DSM-IV diagnosis was based on a semistructured diagnostic interview (Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children) with the parent and youth sequentially, blind to scores on the index tests. Participants were 318 youths aged 5 to 10 (50% with bipolar diagnoses) and 324 youths aged 11 to 17 (41% with bipolar diagnoses). Areas under the curve (AUCs) from receiver operating characteristic analyses and multilevel likelihood ratios quantified test performance. Parent report (AUCs from 0.78 to 0.84 in both age groups) outperformed teacher (AUCs 0.57 in the younger sample and 0.70 in the older sample) or adolescent measures (AUCs 0.67 [General Behavior Inventory] and 0.71 [Youth Self-Report]) at identifying bipolar disorders. Combining tests did not produce clinically meaningful classification improvement. Parent report was more useful than teacher report or adolescent self-report on the index tests studied. Results generally replicated across both age groups. Parent report on these instruments could facilitate differential diagnosis of bipolar disorder in youths aged 5 to 17 years, especially by decreasing the rate of false-positive diagnoses.","Three screening tests (CBCL, P-GBI, and P-YMRS) available for the office setting use parent-reported scores, and perform best when compared with kiddie schedule for affective disorders and schizophrenia as the standard. These instruments were associated with likelihood ratios that significantly improved the odds of diagnosis and could allow clinicians to stratify patients as high or low risk."
"Do antibiotics improve outcomes in chronic rhinosinusitis
A double-blind randomized controlled trial on 79 patients aged between 2 and 12 years with chronic sinusitis showed no significant advantage of adding antibiotics to the treatment by sinus lavage. The prognosis after both 6 and 12 weeks was worse for patients with bilateral opaque sinus radiographs. Half of the Branhanmella catarrhalis cultured in this study were beta-lactamase producing organisms, therefore antibiotics prescribed for this group of children should be chosen bearing this in mind.","Another study randomized 79 children with chronic sinusitis to treatment with cefaclor vs placebo following antral washout. Measured outcomes were similar to those in the prior study. At 6 weeks, 12.3% more patients in the antibiotic group achieved cure than the placebo group (64.8% vs 52.5%), but this difference was not statistically significant (P=.28). At 12 weeks, no differences in improvement were seen between the 2 groups (89% vs 89.5%)."
"How often should you follow up on a patient with newly diagnosed hypothyroidism
Thyroid disease affects up to 0.5 percent of the population of the United States. Its prevalence is higher in women and the elderly. The management of hypothyroidism focuses on ensuring that patients receive appropriate thyroid hormone replacement therapy and monitoring their response. Hormone replacement should be initiated in a low dosage, especially in the elderly and in patients prone to cardiac problems. The dosage should be increased gradually, and laboratory values should be monitored six to eight weeks after any dosage change. Once a stable dosage is achieved, annual monitoring of the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level is probably unnecessary, except in older patients. After full replacement of thyroxine (T4) using levothyroxine, the addition of triiodothyronine (T3) in a low dosage may be beneficial in some patients who continue to have mood or memory problems. The management of patients with subclinical hypothyroidism (a high TSH in the presence of normal free T4 and T3 levels) remains controversial. In these patients, physicians should weigh the benefits of replacement (e.g., improved cardiac function) against problems that can accompany the excessive use of levothyroxine (e.g., osteoporosis).","Generally, once a stable maintenance dosage of levothyroxine is achieved, the dosage will remain adequate until the patient has a significant weight change or reaches his or her seventh or eighth decade."
"Are tympanostomy tubes indicated for recurrent acute otitis media
To assess the change in disease-specific quality of life in children with recurrent acute otitis media and/or chronic otitis media with effusion treated with surgical intervention. Prospective questionnaire-based outcome study. An academic pediatric otolaryngology practice. Consecutive series of 123 children referred for surgical treatment of recurrent acute otitis media and/or chronic otitis media with effusion. INTERVENTION AND METHODS: Surgery included bilateral myringotomy and tympanostomy tube placement either alone or with adenoidectomy. An otitis media disease-specific questionnaire was administered before and after surgical intervention. Comparison of the mean percentage change in total ear symptom score between presurgery and postsurgery scores at 1 and 6 months after surgery. The mean percentage change in total ear symptom score was a 74.5% improvement (P<.001) at the 1-month follow-up and a 59.8% improvement (P<.001) at the 6-month follow-up. Parental worry related to the child's ear problems was also significantly decreased, with a mean otitis media disease-specific questionnaire score of 3.43 (P<.001) at 1 month and 2.64 (P<.001) at 6 months after surgery. When caregivers were asked if they would have their child undergo tympanostomy tube placement if they had to make the decision again, 91% and 84% responded yes at the 1- and 6-month follow-up, respectively. The disease-specific quality of life of children with recurrent acute otitis media and/or chronic otitis media with effusion with appropriate surgical indications significantly improved after surgical intervention. The amount of parental worry concerning their children's ear problems also significantly improved following surgery, and most caregivers would opt again for tube placement.","In prospective studies of patients receiving tubes for recurrent acute otitis media and otitis media with effusion, an ear symptom score improved after tube placement."
"Do antipyretics prolong febrile illness
Fever control measures are commonly used in treating malaria. Some researchers have suggested that fever reduction may prolong malaria illness. We aim to assess whether antipyretic measures in malaria influences outcome, measured by length of illness, parasitaemia, and occurrence of convulsions. We searched the Cochrane infectious Diseases Group Trial Register, the Cochrane Controlled Trial Register, and other electronic bibliographies, and contacted researchers and organizations working in this field. Randomised or pseudo-randomised trials which compared antipyretic drugs with mechanical or no antipyretic measures in patients with slide-confirmed malaria. Inclusion criteria were independently applied by two reviewers. We extracted data from selected trials using a standard form. Weighted mean difference with 95% confidence interval was calculated for continuous data. Three randomised trials with pooled 128 adults and children with falciparum malaria; all unblinded; allocation concealment unclear in two. Inconsistent pattern of fever clearance between trials, but malaria cure rate reported to be similar between intervention and control in all trials. Mean parasite clearance time reported to be similar in one trial but longer in paracetamol group in two trials: sample size in one trial was too small to conclude anything (n=7), while the other trial was difficult to evaluate. There is no statistically significant data to draw any conclusions. The clinical significance of preliminary report suggesting that antipyretic drugs prolong malaria parasitaemia was not confirmed.","A Cochrane review examined 3 trials of acetaminophen vs placebo for fever in 128 adults and children with P falciparum malaria. Although fever clearance varied between the trials, the malaria cure rate was similar in all, and the review concluded that data were insufficient to evaluate an effect on parasitemia."
"Is surgery effective for reducing symptoms in adults with obstructive sleep apnea
The enthusiasm for uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP) in the treatment of obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) has declined in recent years, partly because of a lower success rate over time and partly because of adverse effects. Reports on the beneficial effects of dental appliances exist, but only one prospective randomized study has been published comparing dental appliances with nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment. No study has been published comparing dental appliance treatment with UPPP. Ninety-five male patients with confirmed OSA, subjective daytime sleepiness and an apnoea index (AI) > 5 were randomized for subsequent treatment with either a dental appliance or UPPP. There were 49 patients in the dental appliance group and 46 in the UPPP group. Thirty-seven patients in the dental appliance group and 43 in the UPPP group completed the 12-month follow-up. The success rate (rate of patients with at least a 50% reduction in AI) for the dental appliance group was 95%, which was significantly higher (p < 0.01) than the 70% success rate for the UPPP group. According to the criteria for OSA (apnoea index > or = 5 or apnoea/hypopnoea index > or = 10), 78% of the dental appliance group and 51% of the UPPP group were normalized after 12 months. The difference between the groups was significant (p < 0.05). These findings suggest that the dental appliance technique is useful in the treatment of mild to moderate OSA.",A trial compared UPPP with dental appliances in late 1999 and found dental appliances superior to surgery for improving apnea scores.
"Which tests are the most useful for diagnosing pelvic inflammatory disease
To evaluate the clinical diagnosis of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) compared with the diagnosis of PID made by laparoscopy, endometrial biopsy, transvaginal ultrasound, and cervical and endometrial cultures. Study design: A diagnostic performance test study was carried out by cross-sectional analysis in 61 women. A group presenting PID (n = 31) was compared with a group (n = 30) presenting another cause for non-specific lower abdominal pain (NSLAP). Diagnosis provided by an evaluated method was compared with a standard diagnosis (by surgical findings, histopathology, and microbiology). The pathologist was unaware of the visual findings and presumptive diagnoses given by other methods. All clinical and laboratory PID criteria showed low discrimination capacity. Adnexal tenderness showed the greatest sensitivity. Clinical diagnosis had 87% sensitivity, while laparoscopy had 81% sensitivity and 100% specificity; transvaginal ultrasound had 30% sensitivity and 67% specificity; and endometrial culture had 83% sensitivity and 26% specificity. Clinical criteria represent the best diagnostic method for discriminating PID. Laparoscopy showed the best specificity and is thus useful in those cases having an atypical clinical course for discarding abdominal pain when caused by another factor. The other diagnostic methods might have limited use.","A cohort study study compared clinical criteria to several reference standards (laparoscopy, histology, microbiological markers, and transvaginal ultrasound) and found clinical criteria, specifically adnexal tenderness, most sensitive (87%), and laparoscopy most specific (100%)."
"How soon should serum potassium levels be monitored for patients started on diuretics
Published data have been used to define the characteristics of the fall in serum potassium concentration after taking diuretics and the efficacy of the various treatments given to prevent or correct it. The average fall is less after the usual doses of frusemide (about 0.3 mmol/l) than after the usual doses of thiazides (about 0.6 mmol/l) and is little influenced by the dose or duration of treatment. The fall with a given drug is the same in heart failure and hypertension, but the initial serum potassium concentration is higher in heart failure, so that the final value is lower in hypertension. In standard doses potassium supplements are less effective than potassium-retaining diuretics in correcting the hypokalaemia. The relation between the average serum potassium value and the frequency of low values (hypokalaemia) is such that very low values after taking diuretics are unusual in patients with hypertension or heart failure. Hypokalaemia would almost disappear as an important complication of diuretic treatment if it was defined as a value less than 3.0 mmol/l rather than as a value less than 3.5 mmol/l.",Morgan and Davidson performed an analysis of the published data available in 1980. They found that the average fall in potassium is less for patients taking furosemide (0.3mmol/L) than on thiazide diuretics (0.6mmol/L) and that this fall was only slightly influenced by dose or duration of treatment.
"What is the best diagnostic approach to postmenopausal vaginal bleeding in women taking hormone replacement therapy
Postmenopausal vaginal bleeding is a common clinical problem. Endovaginal ultrasound (EVUS) is a noninvasive diagnostic test that may help determine which women should undergo endometrial biopsy. To determine the accuracy of EVUS in detecting endometrial disease in postmenopausal women with vaginal bleeding according to hormone replacement use. Literature search of English-language and non-English-language articles published from 1966 through November 1996 using MEDLINE and by a manual search of bibliographies of published articles. Studies were included if they prospectively collected EVUS measurements of endometrial thickness prior to obtaining endometrial tissue for histologic evaluation in postmenopausal women with vaginal bleeding. Of 85 studies that included data on EVUS and endometrial histology, 35 were included in the meta-analysis and included 5892 women. Articles were reviewed and independently selected and abstracted by 2 reviewers. Disagreement was resolved by consensus. The overall summary mean weighted estimates of sensitivity and specificity were calculated for thresholds of endometrial thickness from 3 to 10 mm. Using a 5-mm threshold to define abnormal endometrial thickening, 96% (95% confidence interval [CI], 94%-98%) of women with cancer had an abnormal EVUS result, whereas 92% (95% CI, 90%-93%) of women with endometrial disease (cancer, polyp, or atypical hyperplasia) had an abnormal result. This did not vary by hormone replacement use. However, the number of women with normal histology who had an abnormal EVUS result did vary by hormone replacement use. In women who were not using hormone replacement therapy, 593 (8%) with normal histological findings had an abnormal EVUS result (specificity, 92%; 95% CI, 90%-94%), whereas 1544 (23%) using hormone replacement therapy had an abnormal EVUS result (specificity, 77%; 95% CI, 75%-79%). For a postmenopausal woman with vaginal bleeding with a 10% pretest probability of endometrial cancer, her probability of cancer is 1% following a normal EVUS result. Endovaginal ultrasound has a high sensitivity for detecting endometrial cancer and other endometrial disease and can reliably identify postmenopausal women with vaginal bleeding who are highly unlikely to have significant endometrial disease so that endometrial sampling may be unnecessary.","Endometrial biopsy fails (eg, from cervical stenosis) or is nondiagnostic in 2% to 28% of attempts."
"What are effective therapies for Clostridium difficile- associated diarrhea
High-dose (500 mg orally four times daily) vancomycin is considered by many investigators to be the most effective treatment for antibiotic-associated Clostridium difficile colitis. However, a lower dosage of 125 or 150 mg given three or four times a day has become popular, has been shown to be effective, and is less expensive than the high-dose regimen. We therefore decided to compare two vancomycin dosage regimens in a randomized trial. The study involved 46 hospitalized patients with serious underlying diseases complicated by C. difficile diarrhea or colitis. Patients were assigned (according to a table of random numbers) to treatment with either 125 or 500 mg of vancomycin orally four times daily for an average of 10 days. No significant differences in measurable responses to the two regimens were noted. There were no treatment failures. The mean duration of diarrhea after initiation of therapy was about four days, and almost all patients had no diarrhea after one week. The organism continued to be demonstrated in the stools of about 50 percent of patients for the first few weeks after completion of therapy, and nine (20 percent) patients developed a recurrence of their diarrheal illness. Vancomycin was well tolerated by all patients. Since the dose of 125 mg appeared to be as effective as the 500-mg dose, which is more expensive, the 125-mg dose is preferred when vancomycin is used in treatment of this disease, unless the patient is critically ill.",No published data exist indicating that vancomycin is more effective than metronidazole in any clinical setting. A dose-range study showed that 125 mg of oral vancomycin 4 times a day is as effective as higher doses.
"Which postmenopausal women should be offered combined hormone replacement therapy
Although postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is widely used in the United States, new evidence about its benefits and harms requires reconsideration of its use for the primary prevention of chronic conditions. To assess the benefits and harms of HRT for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease, thromboembolism, osteoporosis, cancer, dementia, and cholecystitis by reviewing the literature, conducting meta-analyses, and calculating outcome rates. All relevant English-language studies were identified in MEDLINE (1966-2001), HealthSTAR (1975-2001), Cochrane Library databases, and reference lists of key articles. Recent results of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) and the Heart and Estrogen/progestin Replacement Study (HERS) are included for reported outcomes. We used all published studies of HRT if they contained a comparison group of HRT nonusers and reported data relating to HRT use and clinical outcomes of interest. Studies were excluded if the population was selected according to prior events or presence of conditions associated with higher risks for targeted outcomes. Meta-analyses of observational studies indicated summary relative risks (RRs) for coronary heart disease (CHD) incidence and mortality that were significantly reduced among current HRT users only, although risk for incidence was not reduced when only studies that controlled for socioeconomic status were included. The WHI reported increased CHD events (hazard ratio [HR], 1.29; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-1.63). Stroke incidence but not mortality was significantly increased among HRT users in the meta-analysis and the WHI. The meta-analysis indicated that risk was significantly elevated for thromboembolic stroke (RR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.01-1.40) but not subarachnoid or intracerebral stroke. Risk of venous thromboembolism among current HRT users was increased overall (RR, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.64-2.81) and was highest during the first year of use (RR, 3.49; 95% CI, 2.33-5.59) according to a meta-analysis of 12 studies. Protection against osteoporotic fractures is supported by a meta-analysis of 22 estrogen trials, cohort studies, results of the WHI, and trials with bone density outcomes. Current estrogen users have an increased risk of breast cancer that increases with duration of use. Endometrial cancer incidence, but not mortality, is increased with unopposed estrogen use but not with estrogen with progestin. A meta-analysis of 18 observational studies showed a 20% reduction in colon cancer incidence among women who had ever used HRT (RR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.74-0.86), a finding supported by the WHI. Women symptomatic from menopause had improvement in certain aspects of cognition. Current studies of estrogen and dementia are not definitive. In a cohort study, current HRT users had an age-adjusted RR for cholecystitis of 1.8 (95% CI, 1.6-2.0), increasing to 2.5 (95% CI, 2.0-2.9) after 5 years of use. Benefits of HRT include prevention of osteoporotic fractures and colorectal cancer, while prevention of dementia is uncertain. Harms include CHD, stroke, thromboembolic events, breast cancer with 5 or more years of use, and cholecystitis.","Continuing hormone replacement therapy beyond 5 years dramatically increases the risk of coronary heart disease, stroke, thromboembolic events, breast cancer, and cholecystitis."
"What is the best management for patients who have a TIA while on aspirin therapy
To determine the effects of antiplatelet therapy among patients at high risk of occlusive vascular events. Collaborative meta-analyses (systematic overviews). Randomised trials of an antiplatelet regimen versus control or of one antiplatelet regimen versus another in high risk patients (with acute or previous vascular disease or some other predisposing condition) from which results were available before September 1997. Trials had to use a method of randomisation that precluded prior knowledge of the next treatment to be allocated and comparisons had to be unconfounded-that is, have study groups that differed only in terms of antiplatelet regimen. 287 studies involving 135 000 patients in comparisons of antiplatelet therapy versus control and 77 000 in comparisons of different antiplatelet regimens. ""Serious vascular event"": non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, or vascular death. Overall, among these high risk patients, allocation to antiplatelet therapy reduced the combined outcome of any serious vascular event by about one quarter; non-fatal myocardial infarction was reduced by one third, non-fatal stroke by one quarter, and vascular mortality by one sixth (with no apparent adverse effect on other deaths). Absolute reductions in the risk of having a serious vascular event were 36 (SE 5) per 1000 treated for two years among patients with previous myocardial infarction; 38 (5) per 1000 patients treated for one month among patients with acute myocardial infarction; 36 (6) per 1000 treated for two years among those with previous stroke or transient ischaemic attack; 9 (3) per 1000 treated for three weeks among those with acute stroke; and 22 (3) per 1000 treated for two years among other high risk patients (with separately significant results for those with stable angina (P=0.0005), peripheral arterial disease (P=0.004), and atrial fibrillation (P=0.01)). In each of these high risk categories, the absolute benefits substantially outweighed the absolute risks of major extracranial bleeding. Aspirin was the most widely studied antiplatelet drug, with doses of 75-150 mg daily at least as effective as higher daily doses. The effects of doses lower than 75 mg daily were less certain. Clopidogrel reduced serious vascular events by 10% (4%) compared with aspirin, which was similar to the 12% (7%) reduction observed with its analogue ticlopidine. Addition of dipyridamole to aspirin produced no significant further reduction in vascular events compared with aspirin alone. Among patients at high risk of immediate coronary occlusion, short term addition of an intravenous glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonist to aspirin prevented a further 20 (4) vascular events per 1000 (P<0.0001) but caused 23 major (but rarely fatal) extracranial bleeds per 1000. Aspirin (or another oral antiplatelet drug) is protective in most types of patient at increased risk of occlusive vascular events, including those with an acute myocardial infarction or ischaemic stroke, unstable or stable angina, previous myocardial infarction, stroke or cerebral ischaemia, peripheral arterial disease, or atrial fibrillation. Low dose aspirin (75-150 mg daily) is an effective antiplatelet regimen for long term use, but in acute settings an initial loading dose of at least 150 mg aspirin may be required. Adding a second antiplatelet drug to aspirin may produce additional benefits in some clinical circumstances, but more research into this strategy is needed.","A meta-analysis evaluated 158 randomized trials involving primary and secondary prevention of stroke, concluding that antiplatelet therapy results in a 30% reduction in occurrence of ischemic stroke (95% confidence interval [CI], 24-35; P<.0001). Data that evaluate the antiplatelet efficacy following a TIA while on aspirin therapy are limited."
"What is the clinical workup for failure to thrive
The term 'failure to thrive' (FTT) is widely used to describe inadequate growth in early childhood. However, no consensus exists concerning the specific anthropometrical criteria to define this description. The aim of this study was to make an updated assessment concerning the use of FTT definitions and describe possible trends regarding the use of specific criteria. A cross-sectional review was done covering English-language articles published from January 2003 until June 2004, and recent textbooks of general pediatrics. Most of the reviewed literature broadly defined FTT as inadequate growth and total agreement existed to define FTT based solely on anthropometrical parameters. Large differences, however, were seen regarding which growth parameters to use and whether to use attained values or velocities. Weight was the most predominant choice, but many included more than one anthropometrical parameter. Failure to thrive in children is currently described solely based on anthropometrical indicators, with weight gain as the predominant choice of indicator and cut off around the 5th percentile. Discussion is needed as to whether the term 'failure to thrive' is still a useful common term for pediatric undernutrition of different types.","failure to thrive is a generic term used to describe a child whose current weight (or trajectory of weight gain) does not equal that of other children of similar age, gender, and ethnicity. No single accepted anthropometric measure can be used to diagnose the condition."
"Which treatments are effective for cervical radiculopathy
Cervical spondylosis causes pain and disability by compressing the spinal cord or roots. Surgery to relieve the compression may reduce the pain and disability, but is associated with a small but definite risk. We sought to assess the balance of risk and benefit from surgery. To determine whether: 1) surgical treatment of cervical radiculopathy or myelopathy is associated with improved outcome, compared with conservative management and 2) timing of surgery (immediate or delayed upon persistence/progression of relevant symptoms and signs) has an impact on outcome. We searched Medline (between 1966 and 1998), Embase (between 1980 and 1998) and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register. Authors of the identified randomised controlled trials were contacted to detect any additional published or unpublished data. All unconfounded truly or quasi-randomised controlled trials allocating patients with cervical radiculopathy or myelopathy to 1) ""best medical management"" or ""decompressive surgery (with or without some form of fusion) plus best medical management"" 2) ""early decompressive surgery"" or ""delayed decompressive surgery"". Two authors independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed trial quality and extracted the data. Two trials involving a total of 130 patients were included. One trial with 81 patients compared surgical decompression with either physiotherapy or cervical collar immobilization in patients with cervical radiculopathy. The short-term effects of surgery, in terms of pain, weakness or sensory loss were superior, however, at one year no significant differences between groups were present. One trial with 49 patients compared the effects of surgery with those of conservative treatment in patients with mild functional deficit associated with cervical myelopathy. No significant differences were observed between groups, up to two years following treatment. The available small randomised trials do not provide reliable evidence on the effects of surgery for cervical spondylotic radiculopathy or myelopathy. It is not clear whether the short-term risks of surgery are offset by any long-term benefits.","A Cochrane review found only one randomized controlled trials (N=81) that compared surgery with conservative treatment (physiotherapy and the cervical collar). Twenty patients crossed over to another treatment, including 3 surgical patients who improved before surgery and 11 who did postop physiotherapy. Patients were still analyzed by intention to treat, however. The surgery group showed greater pain improvement at 3 months, as assessed by visual analogue scale (0 to 100), than the physiotherapy group (mean difference [MD]=-14; 95% confidence interval [CI], -27.84 to -0.16) and the cervical collar (MD=-21; 95% CI, -33.32 to -8.68). At 1 year, however, no difference was seen between surgery and physiotherapy (MD=-9; 95% CI, -23.39 to 5.39) or between surgery and the cervical collar (MD=-5; 95% CI, -18.84 to 8.84). Laminectomy to reduce nerve compression may alleviate pain and improve function, but it has risks. Surgical procedures for cervical radiculomyelopathy have reported death rates of 0% to 1.8%; nonfatal complications occurred in 1% to 8% of patients."
"What is the most effective treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in children
Atomoxetine is an investigational, nonstimulant pharmacotherapy being studied as potential treatment for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). It is thought to act via blockade of the presynaptic norepinephrine transporter in the brain. We assessed the efficacy of 3 doses of atomoxetine compared with placebo in children and adolescents with ADHD. A total of 297 children and adolescents who were 8 to 18 years of age and had ADHD as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition, were randomized to placebo or atomoxetine dosed on a weight-adjusted basis at 0.5 mg/kg/day, 1.2 mg/kg/day, or 1.8 mg/kg/day for an 8-week period. ADHD symptoms, affective symptoms, and social and family functioning were assessed using parent and investigator rating scales. Approximately 71% of children enrolled were male, approximately 67% met criteria for mixed subtype (both inattentive and hyperactive/impulsive symptoms), and the only common psychiatric comorbidity was oppositional defiant disorder (approximately 38% of the sample). At baseline, symptom severity was rated as moderate to severe for most children. At endpoint, atomoxetine 1.2 mg/kg/day and 1.8 mg/kg/day were consistently associated with superior outcomes in ADHD symptoms compared with placebo and were not different from each other. The dose of 0.5 mg/kg/day was associated with intermediate efficacy between placebo and the 2 higher doses, suggesting a graded dose-response. Social and family functioning also were improved in the atomoxetine groups compared with placebo with statistically significant improvements in measures of children's ability to meet psychosocial role expectations and parental impact. Discontinuations as a result of adverse events were <5% for all groups. Among children and adolescents aged 8 to 18, atomoxetine was superior to placebo in reducing ADHD symptoms and in improving social and family functioning symptoms. Atomoxetine was associated with a graded dose-response, and 1.2 mg/kg/day seems to be as effective as 1.8 mg/kg/day and is likely to be the appropriate initial target dose for most patients. Treatment with atomoxetine was safe and well tolerated.","Based on 3 RCTs of 588 children between the ages of 7 and 18 years, atomoxetine showed dose-related improvement in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder rating scales. Side effects of atomoxetine are similar to stimulants and include mild but significant increases in blood pressure and pulse."
"When should we treat isolated high triglycerides
An unresolved issue in preventive cardiology is whether the serum triglyceride level is an independent risk factor for coronary heart disease and, as a direct practical consequence, whether it has value as a diagnostic test. Evidence published in the past year has contributed substantially to clarifying these issues. In this review, we discuss the data that bears upon the importance of triglycerides as a risk factor and the implications of recent clinical trials directed at lipid lowering. We then discuss the alternatives for triglyceride lowering therapy in the light of this new knowledge.","Truly isolated hypertriglyceridemia is rare. To date, no good trials directly address the effect of reducing truly isolated hypertriglyceridemia on cardiovascular morbidity or mortality. High triglycerides are usually accompanied by other features of the ""metabolic syndrome"" (low HDL, high LDL, insulin resistance, diabetes, hypertension, and obesity), making it almost impossible to look at these in isolation or attribute risk to a specific component."
"How safe is vaginal birth after cesarean section for the mother and fetus
When a woman has had a previous caesarean birth, there are two options for her care in a subsequent pregnancy: planned elective repeat caesarean or planned vaginal birth. While there are risks and benefits for both planned elective repeat caesarean birth and planned vaginal birth after caesarean, current sources of information are limited to non-randomised cohort studies. Studies designed in this way have significant potential for bias and consequently conclusions based on these results are limited in their reliability and should be interpreted with caution. To assess, using the best available evidence, the benefits and harms of a policy of planned elective repeat caesarean section with a policy of planned vaginal birth after caesarean section for women with a previous caesarean birth. We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group trials register (24 June 2004), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library, Issue 1, 2004), and PubMed (1966 to 24 June 2004). Randomised controlled trials with reported data that compared outcomes in mothers and babies who planned a repeat elective caesarean section with outcomes in women who planned a vaginal birth, where a previous birth had been by caesarean. Two reviewers independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. There were no randomised controlled trials identified. Planned elective repeat caesarean section and planned vaginal birth after caesarean section for women with a prior caesarean birth are both associated with benefits and harms. Evidence for these care practices is drawn from non-randomised studies, associated with potential bias. Any results and conclusions must therefore be interpreted with caution. Randomised controlled trials are required to provide the most reliable evidence regarding the benefits and harms of both planned elective repeat caesarean section and planned vaginal birth for women with a previous caesarean birth.","The most recent Cochrane Review found that both vaginal birth after cesarean and repeat lowtransverse cesarean section have benefits and risks associated with them; however, after reviewing the limited data, they concluded that no trial exists to adequately help women and their caregivers make an informed decision between the two. A strong theme in the Cochrane Review, echoed in most reviews, was the absence of high-quality prospective randomized data."
"What is the best treatment for hypertension in African Americans
Incidence of end-stage renal disease due to hypertension has increased in recent decades, but the optimal strategy for treatment of hypertension to prevent renal failure is unknown, especially among African Americans. To compare the effects of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (ramipril), a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (amlodipine), and a beta-blocker (metoprolol) on hypertensive renal disease progression. Interim analysis of a randomized, double-blind, 3 x 2 factorial trial conducted in 1094 African Americans aged 18 to 70 years with hypertensive renal disease (glomerular filtration rate [GFR] of 20-65 mL/min per 1.73 m(2)) enrolled between February 1995 and September 1998. This report compares the ramipril and amlodipine groups following discontinuation of the amlodipine intervention in September 2000. Participants were randomly assigned to receive amlodipine, 5 to 10 mg/d (n = 217), ramipril, 2.5 to 10 mg/d (n = 436), or metoprolol, 50 to 200 mg/d (n = 441), with other agents added to achieve 1 of 2 blood pressure goals. The primary outcome measure was the rate of change in GFR; the main secondary outcome was a composite index of the clinical end points of reduction in GFR of more than 50% or 25 mL/min per 1.73 m(2), end-stage renal disease, or death. Among participants with a urinary protein to creatinine ratio of >0.22 (corresponding approximately to proteinuria of more than 300 mg/d), the ramipril group had a 36% (2.02 [SE, 0.74] mL/min per 1.73 m(2)/y) slower mean decline in GFR over 3 years (P =.006) and a 48% reduced risk of the clinical end points vs the amlodipine group (95% confidence interval [CI], 20%-66%). In the entire cohort, there was no significant difference in mean GFR decline from baseline to 3 years between treatment groups (P =.38). However, compared with the amlodipine group, after adjustment for baseline covariates the ramipril group had a 38% reduced risk of clinical end points (95% CI, 13%-56%), a 36% slower mean decline in GFR after 3 months (P =.002), and less proteinuria (P<.001). Ramipril, compared with amlodipine, retards renal disease progression in patients with hypertensive renal disease and proteinuria and may offer benefit to patients without proteinuria.",A randomized controlled trial demonstrated that African Americans may be less responsive to monotherapy with angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors.
"Is an outpatient workup safe for patients with a transient ischemic attack
Patients with transient ischemic attack (TIA) or stroke frequently first contact their primary care physician rather than seeking care at a hospital emergency department. The purpose of the present study was to identify a group of patients seen by primary care physicians in an office setting for a first-ever TIA or stroke and characterize their evaluation and management. Practice audit based on retrospective, structured medical record abstraction from 27 primary care medical practices in 2 geographically separate communities in the eastern United States. Ninety-five patients with a first-ever TIA and 81 with stroke were identified. Seventy-nine percent of those with TIA vs 88% with stroke were evaluated on the day their symptoms occurred (P =.12). Only 6% were admitted to a hospital for evaluation and treatment on the day of the index visit (2% TIA; 10% stroke; P =.03); only an additional 3% were admitted during the subsequent 30 days. Specialists were consulted for 45% of patients. A brain imaging study (computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging) was ordered on the day of the index visit in 30% (23% TIA, 37% stroke; P =.04), regardless of whether the patient was referred to a specialist. Carotid ultrasound studies were obtained in 28% (40% TIA, 14% stroke; P<.001), electrocardiograms in 19% (18% TIA, 21% stroke; P =.60), and echocardiograms in 16% (19% TIA, 14% stroke; P =.34). Fewer than half of patients with a prior history of atrial fibrillation (n = 24) underwent anticoagulation when evaluated at the index visit. Thirty-two percent of patients (31% TIA, 33% stroke; P =.70) were not hospitalized and had no evaluations performed during the first month after presenting to a primary care physician with a first TIA or stroke. Of these patients, 59% had a change in antiplatelet therapy on the day of the index visit. Further primary care physician education regarding the importance of promptly and fully evaluating patients with TIA or stroke may be warranted, and barriers to implementation of established secondary stroke prevention strategies need to be carefully explored. Arch Intern Med. 2000;160:2941-2946","In a study, 31% of the TIA patients had no diagnostic studies performed during the first month after presenting to their primary care physician."
"Which lab tests are best when you suspect hypothyroidism
These clinical practice guidelines summarize the recommendations of the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists for the diagnostic evaluation of hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism and for treatment strategies in patients with these disorders. The sensitive thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH or thyrotropin) assay has become the single best screening test for hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism, and in most outpatient clinical situations, the serum TSH is the most sensitive test for detecting mild thyroid hormone excess or deficiency. Therapeutic options for patients with Graves' disease include thyroidectomy (rarely used now in the United States), antithyroid drugs (frequently associated with relapses), and radioactive iodine (currently the treatment of choice). In clinical hypothyroidism, the standard treatment is levothyroxine replacement, which must be tailored to the individual patient. Awareness of subclinical thyroid disease, which often remains undiagnosed, is emphasized, as is a system of care that incorporates regular follow-up surveillance by one physician as well as education and involvement of the patient.",Experts recommend thyroid-stimulating hormone level as the most cost-effective initial laboratory test for suspected primary hypothyroidism.
"What's the most effective treatment for giardiasis
Giardia duodenalis is the most commonly detected parasite in the intestinal tract of humans and 5-nitroimidazole compounds, quinacrine and furazolidone have been used against giardiasis. However, cases refractory to treatment with these drugs are becoming more common worldwide. To compare the efficacy and safety of mebendazole versus tinidazole in the treatment of giardiasis. 122 children (aged 5 to 15 years) of both sexes with confirmed Giardia duodenalis cysts or trophozoites in their stool samples were randomly separated into two groups of 61 individuals. Each group received either mebendazole 200 mg three times for 1 day or tinidazole 50 mg/kg in a single dose. The evaluation of the efficacy was based on parasitological response. Parents or legal guardians of each child were asked to provide three fecal samples on days 3, 5, and 7 after treatment completion. A child was considered to be cured if no Giardia trophozoites or cysts were found in any of the three post-treatment fecal specimens evaluated by direct wet mounts and/or after Ritchie concentration techniques. The frequency of cure was higher for tinidazole (81.97%) than for mebendazole (63.93%); the difference was statistically significant (p < 0.05). Transient abdominal pain was more common in children treated with mebendazole (p < 0.05), whereas loss of appetite, bitter taste, headache, vomiting, and nausea were more common in the tinidazole-treated group (p < 0.05). Three doses of mebendazole, in a single day, are inferior to a single dose tinidazole in the treatment of giardiasis.",Single-dose tinidazole was superior to 3 doses of mebendazole in a single day in an randomized controlled trials of 122 Cuban children that measured microbiologic cure (NNT=5.5 patients with tinidazole vs mebendazole).
"What gastrointestinal stress ulcer prophylaxis should we provide hospitalized patients
Bleeding from gastroduodenal lesions is a potentially life-threatening complication in patients subjected to overwhelming physiologic stress. Titration of gastric contents with antacid was the first prophylactic treatment regimen proved to decrease the incidence of bleeding and remains the standard by which other methods are compared. We designed a prospective double-blind, double-placebo study comparing the effectiveness of antacid titration with fixed doses of a synthetic prostaglandin E1 analog (misoprostol) for preventing stress gastritis and bleeding. To assess the success of each treatment regimen, we did endoscopic examinations before operation, 72 hours after operation, and after the patient had completed the study. A total of 281 patients entered the study (140 misoprostol, 141 antacid). The two groups were comparable with respect to preoperative parameters and type of operation. We found no statistically significant differences between the two treatment groups concerning upper gastrointestinal tract lesions or serious adverse effects. No clinically evident upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage occurred in either group. Mean gastric pH, measured at two-hour intervals during the initial 72 hours, was maintained at 4.0 or higher in both groups. We conclude that fixed-dose misoprostol is as effective as intensive antacid titration in preventing stress ulcers and bleeding in surgical ICU patients.","Critically ill patients are at increased risk of bleeding from stress-induced gastroduodenal ulceration. Decades ago, ICUs began using pharmacologic prophylaxis on most patients to prevent gastrointestinal bleeding, which had a mortality rate as high as 80%. Before the advent of prophylaxis, the incidence of upper gastro-intestinal bleeding was 6% to 25%."
"How effective are lifestyle changes for controlling hypertension
""The Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure"" provides a new guideline for hypertension prevention and management. The following are the key messages(1) In persons older than 50 years, systolic blood pressure (BP) of more than 140 mm Hg is a much more important cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor than diastolic BP; (2) The risk of CVD, beginning at 115/75 mm Hg, doubles with each increment of 20/10 mm Hg; individuals who are normotensive at 55 years of age have a 90% lifetime risk for developing hypertension; (3) Individuals with a systolic BP of 120 to 139 mm Hg or a diastolic BP of 80 to 89 mm Hg should be considered as prehypertensive and require health-promoting lifestyle modifications to prevent CVD; (4) Thiazide-type diuretics should be used in drug treatment for most patients with uncomplicated hypertension, either alone or combined with drugs from other classes. Certain high-risk conditions are compelling indications for the initial use of other antihypertensive drug classes (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers); (5) Most patients with hypertension will require 2 or more antihypertensive medications to achieve goal BP (<140/90 mm Hg, or <130/80 mm Hg for patients with diabetes or chronic kidney disease); (6) If BP is more than 20/10 mm Hg above goal BP, consideration should be given to initiating therapy with 2 agents, 1 of which usually should be a thiazide-type diuretic; and (7) The most effective therapy prescribed by the most careful clinician will control hypertension only if patients are motivated. Motivation improves when patients have positive experiences with and trust in the clinician. Empathy builds trust and is a potent motivator. Finally, in presenting these guidelines, the committee recognizes that the responsible physician's judgment remains paramount.","Thirteen randomized controlled trials of community-based interventions involving various combinations of lifestyle change advice show mixed results. In general, studies of interventions that were more intensive (ie, longer in duration, larger number of sessions, small group or one-on-one as opposed to large group lectures) and studies with shorter follow-up periods showed more positive results. The magnitude of the blood pressure improvements tended to be lower than exercise, diet, sal reduction or alcohol moderation."
"Which drugs are most effective for moderate to severe depression in adolescents
The safety, efficacy, and tolerability of venlafaxine extended release (ER) in subjects ages 7 to 17 years with major depressive disorder were evaluated in two multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials conducted between October 1997 and August 2001. Participants received venlafaxine ER (flexible dose, based on body weight; intent to treat, n = 169) or placebo (intent to treat, n = 165) for up to 8 weeks. The primary efficacy variable was the change from baseline in the Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised score at week 8. There were no statistically significant differences between venlafaxine ER and placebo on the Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised in either study. A post hoc age subgroup analysis of the pooled data showed greater improvement on the Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised with venlafaxine ER than with placebo (-24.4 versus -19.9; p = .022) among adolescents (ages 12-17), but not among children (ages 7-11). The most common adverse events were anorexia and abdominal pain. Hostility and suicide-related events were more common in venlafaxine ER-treated participants than in placebo-treated participants. There were no completed suicides. Venlafaxine ER may be effective in depressed adolescents. However, its safety and efficacy in pediatric patients has not been established. Prescribers should monitor for signs of suicidal ideation and hostility in pediatric patients taking venlafaxine ER.","A post hoc subgroup analysis of 2 combined RCTs comparing extended-release venlafaxine with placebo showed modest, statistically significant improvement in depressive symptoms in adolescents, but not children."
"What medications are effective for treating symptoms of premenstrual syndrome PMS
Previous reports have suggested that disturbances in calcium regulation may underlie the pathophysiologic characteristics of premenstrual syndrome and that calcium supplementation may be an effective therapeutic approach. To evaluate the effect of calcium carbonate on the luteal and menstrual phases of the menstrual cycle in premenstrual syndrome, a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter clinical trial was conducted. Healthy, premenopausal women between the ages of 18 and 45 years were recruited nationally across the United States at 12 outpatient centers and screened for moderate-to-severe, cyclically recurring premenstrual symptoms. Symptoms were prospectively documented over 2 menstrual cycles with a daily rating scale that had 17 core symptoms and 4 symptom factors (negative affect, water retention, food cravings, and pain). Participants were randomly assigned to receive 1200 mg of elemental calcium per day in the form of calcium carbonate or placebo for 3 menstrual cycles. Routine chemistry, complete blood cell count, and urinalysis were obtained on all participants. Daily documentation of symptoms, adverse effects, and compliance with medications were monitored. The primary outcome measure was the 17-parameter symptom complex score. Seven hundred twenty women were screened for this trial; 497 women were enrolled; 466 were valid for the efficacy analysis. There was no difference in age, weight, height, use of oral contraceptives, or menstrual cycle length between treatment groups. There were no differences between groups in the mean screening symptom complex score of the luteal (P = .659), menstrual (P = .818), or intermenstrual phase (P = .726) of the menstrual cycle. During the luteal phase of the treatment cycle, a significantly lower mean symptom complex score was observed in the calcium-treated group for both the second (P = .007) and third (P < .001) treatment cycles. By the third treatment cycle calcium effectively resulted in an overall 48% reduction in total symptom scores from baseline compared with a 30% reduction in placebo. All 4 symptom factors were significantly reduced by the third treatment cycle. Calcium supplementation is a simple and effective treatment in premenstrual syndrome, resulting in a major reduction in overall luteal phase symptoms.","One well-designed, randomized controlled trial of calcium therapy showed > 50% decrease in symptom complex scores after 3 months in more than half of subjects taking 1200 mg/d supplemental elemental calcium NNT=6."
"Do acetaminophen and an nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs combined relieve osteoarthritis pain better than either alone
To determine the efficacy, gastrointestinal safety, and tolerability of celecoxib (a cyclo-oxygenase 2 (COX 2) inhibitor) used in the treatment of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Systematic review of randomised trials that compared at least 12 weeks' celecoxib treatment with another non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) or placebo and reported efficacy, tolerability, or safety. Trials identified from manufacturer and by searching electronic databases and evaluated according to predefined inclusion and quality criteria. Data combined through meta-analysis. 15 187 patients with osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis. Efficacy: Western Ontario and McMaster universities osteoarthritis index; American College of Rheumatology responder index and joint scores for rheumatoid arthritis. Tolerability: withdrawal rates for adverse effects. Gastrointestinal safety: incidence of ulcers, bleeds, perforations, and obstructions. Nine randomised controlled trials were included. Celecoxib and NSAIDS were equally effective for all efficacy outcomes. Compared with those taking other NSAIDs, in patients taking celecoxib the rate of withdrawals due to adverse gastrointestinal events was 46% lower (95% confidence interval 29% to 58%; NNT 35 at three months), the incidence of ulcers detectable by endoscopy was 71% lower (59% to 79%; NNT 6 at three months), and the incidence of symptoms of ulcers, perforations, bleeds, and obstructions was 39% lower (4% to 61%; NNT 208 at six months). Subgroup analysis of patients taking aspirin showed that the incidence of ulcers detected by endoscopy was reduced by 51% (14% to 72%) in those given celecoxib compared with other NSAIDs. The reduction was greater (73%, 52% to 84%) in those not taking aspirin. Celecoxib is as effective as other NSAIDs for relief of symptoms of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis and has significantly improved gastrointestinal safety and tolerability.",The COX-2 inhibitors rofecoxib (Vioxx) and celecoxib (Celebrex) have been shown to provide equal pain relief compared with naproxen for patients with osteoarthritis.
"Should induction of labor be considered in a woman with a macrosomic baby
The accuracy of estimating birth weight clinically, sonographically (using femur length and abdominal circumference), and by maternal prediction was studied prospectively in 106 term parous women who were in active labor. Estimates of birth weight by these women had lower standardized error (86.8 +/- 78.0 g/kg) than either clinical estimates (90.2 +/- 84.8 g/kg) or sonographically derived estimates (155.8 +/- 118.0 g/kg) of birth weight (P = not significant). Maternal estimates of birth weight were within +/- 10% of the actual weight in 69.8%, compared with 66.1% for clinical estimates and 42.4% for sonography. A term parous woman in labor can predict the birth weight with accuracy comparable to a clinical estimation by a physician or a sonographic estimate based on infant measurements.","Detection of fetal macrosomia is difficult, because there are no reliable methods for determining EFW. Ultrasound estimate of fetal weight may be less accurate than estimates by multiparous patients and clinicians using Leopold maneuvers."
"What is the best way to evaluate and manage diarrhea in the febrile infant
To develop an evidence and consensus based guideline for the management of the child who presents to hospital with diarrhoea (with or without vomiting), a common problem representing 16% of all paediatric medical attenders at an accident and emergency department. Clinical assessment, investigations (biochemistry and stool culture in particular), admission, and treatment are addressed. The guideline aims to aid junior doctors in recognising children who need admission for observation and treatment and those who may safely go home. A systematic review of the literature was performed. Selected articles were appraised, graded, and synthesised qualitatively. Statements on recommendation were generated. CONSENSUS: An anonymous, postal Delphi consensus process was used. A panel of 39 selected medical and nursing staff were asked to grade their agreement with the generated statements. They were sent the papers, appraisals, and literature review. On the second and third rounds they were asked to re-grade their agreement in the light of other panelists' responses. Consensus was predefined as 83% of panelists agreeing with the statement. Clinical signs useful in assessment of level of dehydration were agreed. Admission to a paediatric facility is advised for children who show signs of dehydration. For those with mild to moderate dehydration, estimated deficit is replaced over four hours with oral rehydration solution (glucose based, 200-250 mOsm/l) given ""little and often"". A nasogastric tube should be used if fluid is refused and normal feeds started following rehydration. Children at high risk of dehydration should be observed to ensure at least maintenance fluid is tolerated. Management of more severe dehydration is detailed. Antidiarrhoeal medication is not indicated. The guideline has been successfully implemented and evaluated in a paediatric accident and emergency department.","Effective management of infant diarrhea is based on the degree of dehydration, which can be estimated by percent body weight loss-the difference between the baseline and acute weights, divided by the baseline weight."
"Should we screen for bacterial vaginosis in those at risk for preterm labor
To evaluate whether a screening strategy in pregnancy lowers the rate of preterm delivery in a general population of pregnant women. Multicentre, prospective, randomised controlled trial. Non-hospital based antenatal clinics. 4429 pregnant women presenting for their routine prenatal visits early in the second trimester were screened by Gram stain for asymptomatic vaginal infection. In the intervention group, the women's obstetricians received the test results and women received standard treatment and follow up for any detected infection. In the control group, the results of the vaginal smears were not revealed to the caregivers. The primary outcome variable was preterm delivery at less than 37 weeks. Secondary outcome variables were preterm delivery at less than 37 weeks combined with different birth weight categories equal to or below 2500 g and the rate of late miscarriage. Outcome data were available for 2058 women in the intervention group and 2097 women in the control group. In the intervention group, the number of preterm births was significantly lower than in the control group (3.0% v 5.3%, 95% confidence interval 1.2 to 3.6; P = 0.0001). Preterm births were also significantly reduced in lower weight categories at less than 37 weeks and <or= 2500 g. Eight late miscarriages occurred in the intervention group and 15 in the control group. Integrating a simple infection screening programme into routine antenatal care leads to a significant reduction in preterm births and reduces the rate of late miscarriage in a general population of pregnant women.","A study evaluating screening for vaginal infections in pregnancy has demonstrated a reduction in preterm delivery. In this study, looking at a general obstetrical population in Austria, 4429 asymptomatic pregnant women between 15 and 19.6 weeks gestation had a vaginal screen for bacterial vaginosis, candidiasis and trichomoniasis. The 2048 women in the intervention group were given the results of the screen from their maternity care provider. The 2097 women in the control group and their providers did not receive the results of the vaginal screen. There were 447 women in the intervention group and 441 women in the control group with positive screens. Using the Nugent criteria, women who were diagnosed with bacterial vaginosis received a 6-day course of intravaginal clindamycin 2% cream. Those with positive test results for Candida were treated with intravaginal clotrimazole 0.1 g; those with positive results for trichomonas received intravaginal metronidazole 500 mg for 7 days. After treatment, women with a positive test result in the intervention group had a second vaginal smear between 24 and 28 weeks. Persistent bacterial vaginosis was treated with oral clindamycin 300 mg twice daily for 7 days. If Candida or trichomonas were noted, women were treated with the intravaginal clotrimazole or metronidazole.

"Does tight control of blood glucose in pregnant women with diabetes improve neonatal outcomes
Impaired glucose metabolism in pregnancy may be associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. Primary dietary therapy is used in the management of diabetes, including gestational diabetes. The objective of this review was to assess the effects of primary dietary therapy in women identified as having gestational diabetes on fetal growth and neonatal outcomes. I searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group trials register. Randomised trials of primary dietary therapy compared with no specific treatment in pregnant women with abnormal glucose tolerance test results. Trial quality was assessed. Four studies involving 612 women were included. Trials were small and of variable quality. No differences were detected between primary dietary therapy and no primary dietary therapy for birthweight greater than 4000 grams (odds ratio 0.78, 95% confidence interval 0.45 to 1.35) or caesarean deliveries (odds ratio 0.97, 95% confidence interval 0.65 to 1.44). There is not enough evidence to evaluate the use of primary dietary therapy for women who show impaired glucose metabolism during pregnancy.","A Cochrane systematic review evaluating a small number of trials, with variable quality and inconsistent outcome measures, compared dietary management to routine care in gestational diabetics. While fewer infants with birth weights >4000 g were delivered in the diet therapy group (OR=0.78; 95% CI, 0.45-1.35), the results were not statistically significant. No other important clinical differences were found."
"How safe is vaginal birth after cesarean section for the mother and fetus
The proportion of women who attempt vaginal delivery after prior cesarean delivery has decreased largely because of concern about safety. The absolute and relative risks associated with a trial of labor in women with a history of cesarean delivery, as compared with elective repeated cesarean delivery without labor, are uncertain. We conducted a prospective four-year observational study of all women with a singleton gestation and a prior cesarean delivery at 19 academic medical centers. Maternal and perinatal outcomes were compared between women who underwent a trial of labor and women who had an elective repeated cesarean delivery without labor. Vaginal delivery was attempted by 17,898 women, and 15,801 women underwent elective repeated cesarean delivery without labor. Symptomatic uterine rupture occurred in 124 women who underwent a trial of labor (0.7 percent). Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy occurred in no infants whose mothers underwent elective repeated cesarean delivery and in 12 infants born at term whose mothers underwent a trial of labor (P<0.001). Seven of these cases of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy followed uterine rupture (absolute risk, 0.46 per 1000 women at term undergoing a trial of labor), including two neonatal deaths. The rate of endometritis was higher in women undergoing a trial of labor than in women undergoing repeated elective cesarean delivery (2.9 percent vs. 1.8 percent), as was the rate of blood transfusion (1.7 percent vs. 1.0 percent). The frequency of hysterectomy and of maternal death did not differ significantly between groups (0.2 percent vs. 0.3 percent, and 0.02 percent vs. 0.04 percent, respectively). A trial of labor after prior cesarean delivery is associated with a greater perinatal risk than is elective repeated cesarean delivery without labor, although absolute risks are low. This information is relevant for counseling women about their choices after a cesarean section.","The effect of vaginal birth after cesarean on neonatal morbidity and mortality is unclear. A large, multicenter, prospective, nonrandomized trial involving 33,699 patients found no significant difference between vaginal birth after cesarean and planned cesarean for hysterectomy (0.2% vs 0.3%; odds ratio [OR]=0.77; 95% CI, 0.51-1.17), maternal death (0.02% vs 0.04%; OR=0.38; 95% CI, 0.1-1.46), and neonatal death (0.08% vs 0.05%; OR=1.82; 95% CI, 0.73-4.57). Significant associations were found for uterine rupture rates in spontaneous labor (24/6685 [0.4%] vs no cases; number needed to harm [NNH]=279) and neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (0.46 cases per 1000 vs no cases; NNH=2174)."
"What is the best macrolide for atypical pneumonia
We evaluated 260 previously healthy children ages 3 through 12 years who had clinical signs and symptoms of pneumonia, radiographically confirmed. Patients were randomized 1:1 to a 10-day course of either clarithromycin suspension 15 mg/kg/day divided twice a day or erythromycin suspension 40 mg/kg/day divided twice a day or three times a day. Evidence of infection with Chlamydia pneumoniae was detected in 28% (74) of patients: 13% (34) by nasopharyngeal culture and 18% (48) by serology with the microimmunofluorescence assay. Evidence of infection with Mycoplasma pneumoniae was detected in 27% (69) of patients: 20% (53) by nasopharyngeal culture or polymerase chain reaction and 17% (44) by serology with the use of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Serologic confirmation of infection was observed in 23% (8) and 53% (28) of patients with bacteriologically detected C. pneumoniae and M. pneumoniae, respectively. Treatment with clarithromycin vs. erythromycin, respectively, yielded the following outcomes: clinical success 98% (121 of 124) vs. 95% (105 of 110); radiologic success 98% (109 of 111) vs. 94% (92 of 110); and eradication by pathogen, C. pneumoniae 79% (15 of 19) vs. 86% (12 of 14) and M. pneumoniae 100% (9 of 9) vs. 100% (4 of 4). Adverse events were primarily gastrointestinal occurring in almost one-fourth of patients in both groups, and were mild to moderate in severity. Clarithromycin and erythromycin were similarly effective and safe for the treatment of radiographically proved, community-acquired pneumonia in children older than 2 years old.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Clarithromycin and erythromycin were compared in children aged 3 to 12 years with CAP. M pneumoniae or C pneumoniae was identified in 42 cases. Two of 18 patients did not respond to erythromycin; 3 of 27 patients did not respond to clarithromycin.
"How effective are leukotriene inhibitors for asthma in children
The objective of our study was to compare the efficacy and safety of fluticasone propionate (an inhaled corticosteroid) with zafirlukast (a leukotriene modifier) for persistent asthma. In this randomized placebo-controlled, parallel-group, double-blind, double-dummy trial, patients underwent an 8- to 14-day run-in period followed by 12 weeks of treatment with inhaled fluticasone propionate (88 mg twice daily by metered-dose inhaler), oral zafirlukast (20 mg twice daily), or placebo. We included a total of 338 persistent asthma patients, 12 years of age or older, using short-acting b2-agonists alone. measured Efficacy outcomes included changes in pulmonary function, asthma symptoms, rescue albuterol use, nighttime awakenings due to asthma, and quality of life. Safety outcomes included asthma exacerbations, adverse events, and clinically significant laboratory test results. After 12 weeks of treatment, patients taking fluticasone propionate experienced significantly greater improvements in all clinical parameters (symptom scores, percentages of symptom-free and albuterol-free days, albuterol use, and nighttime awakenings) compared with patients taking zafirlukast (P <.05) or placebo (P <.05). Treatment with fluticasone propionate resulted in significantly greater improvements in pulmonary function compared with zafirlukast (P <.05) or placebo (P <.05). Fewer fluticasone propionate patients (4%) had an exacerbation requiring oral corticosteroids compared with those taking zafirlukast (12%) or placebo (10%). Inhaled fluticasone propionate is more effective than zafirlukast in controlling asthma symptoms, improving pulmonary function, and improving quality of life for patients who are symptomatic with the use of short-acting b2-agonists alone.","A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 338 patients aged 12 years to adult compared zafirlukast (Accolate) with fluticasone propionate (Flovent) for control of persistent asthma. This study concluded that fluticasone was superior for all clinical outcomes measured including symptom scores, albuterol use, nighttime awakenings pulmonary function, and number of exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids. Pooling of adult and adolescent cases in this study limits generalized application of these results to pediatric practice."
"What medications are safe and effective for heartburn during pregnancy
A double blind comparative study comparing Mucaine, Mucaine without oxethazaine, and placebo was carried out with 50 patients with symptoms of heartburn during late pregnancy. We found that the 2 active treatments were more effective than placebo for the relief of heartburn, but there was no statistically significant difference between groups for the relief of nausea and regurgitation. There was a significant difference in the percentage of days of use of each medication, with the placebo being used least frequently. Although not statistically significant, for the 3 measures for which placebo differed from the active treatments, patients showed a better response to mucaine. This suggests that the addition of oxethazaine may be of benefit. The lack of statistical significance may be due to the relatively small number of cases, and the findings are promising. No side effects were recorded for any treatment.",Patients who received a combination of magnesium and aluminum hydroxide for 7 days had no more relief of symptoms than the placebo group.
"What measures relieve postherpetic neuralgia
The cause of postherpetic neuralgia is damage to peripheral neurons, dorsal root ganglia, and the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, secondary to herpes zoster infection (shingles). In postherpetic neuralgia, peripheral neurons discharge spontaneously and have lowered activation thresholds, and exhibit an exaggerated response to stimuli. Topical lidocaine dampens peripheral nociceptor sensitisation and central nervous system hyperexcitability, and may benefit patients with postherpetic neuralgia. To examine the efficacy and safety of topical lidocaine in the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia. We searched the Cochrane Pain, Palliative and Supportive Care Group Trials Register, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and LILACS, SIGLE for conference proceedings, Citation Index, the reference lists of all eligible trials, key textbooks, and previous systematic reviews. We also wrote to authors of all identified trials. Randomised or quasi-randomised trials comparing all topical applications of lidocaine, including gels and patches in patients of all ages with postherpetic neuralgia (pain persisting at the site of shingles at least one month after the onset of the acute rash). Two review authors extracted data, and a third checked them. We obtained some missing data from the US Food and Drugs Administration. Three trials involving 182 topical lidocaine treated participants and 132 control participants were included. Two trials gave data on pain relief, and the remaining study provided data on secondary outcome measures. The largest trial published as an abstract compared topical lidocaine patch to a placebo patch and accounted for 150 of the 314 patients (48%).A meta-analysis combining two of the three studies identified a significant difference between the topical lidocaine and control groups for the primary outcome measure: a mean improvement in pain relief according to a pain relief scale. Topical lidocaine relieved pain better than placebo (P = 0.003). There was a statistical difference between the groups for the secondary outcome measure of mean VAS score reduction (P = 0.03), but this was only for a single small trial. There were a similar number of adverse skin reactions in both treatment and placebo groups. The highest recorded blood lidocaine concentration varied between 59 ng/ml and 431 ng/ml between trials. The latter figure is high and the authors of the study suggest that the sample had been contaminated during the assay procedure. There is insufficient evidence to recommend topical lidocaine as a first-line agent in the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia with allodynia. Further research should be undertaken on the efficacy of topical lidocaine for other chronic neuropathic pain disorders, and also to compare different classes of drugs (e.g. topical anaesthetics versus anti-epileptics).","The anesthetic lidocaine patch 5% has shown efficacy in PHN with allodynia based on 3 RCTs of lower quality (short duration, recruitment of patients who had improved on lidocaine previously, no report of baseline levels of pain); the number needed to treat was 2 (95% CI, 1.4-3.3). A systematic review of these 3 RCTs concluded that evidence is insufficient to recommend the lidocaine patch as treatment for PHN."
"What are the treatment options for SSRI-related sexual dysfunction
Several different classes of antidepressants have been associated with sexual adverse effects. This double-blind, randomized trial compared the effects of nefazodone and sertraline on reemergence of sexual dysfunction in depressed patients who had experienced sexual dysfunction as a result of sertraline treatment. Depressive symptoms were also monitored. One hundred five patients with DSM-III-R major depressive episode who were experiencing sexual dysfunction attributable to sertraline (100 mg/day) were screened for entry. Eligible patients entered a 1-week washout period that was followed by a 7- to 10-day single-blind placebo phase. Patients without symptoms of sexual dysfunction at the end of the single-blind placebo phase were randomly assigned to receive double-blind treatment with either nefazodone (400 mg/day) or sertraline (100 mg/day) for 8 weeks. Nearly 3 times more sertraline-treated patients (76%; 25/33) experienced reemergence of sexual dysfunction (ejaculatory and/or orgasmic difficulty) than did nefazodone-treated patients (26%; 10/39) (p < .001). In addition, patients treated with nefazodone were more satisfied with their sexual functioning than were patients treated with sertraline. Both treatment groups demonstrated a similar and sustained improvement in depressive symptoms. Both drugs were well tolerated, and the overall incidence of adverse reactions was similar for both treatment groups; however, 9 sertraline-treated patients (26%) discontinued because of adverse events compared with 5 nefazodone-treated patients (12%). Of the patients discontinuing therapy for adverse events, 5 of the sertraline-treated patients did so because of sexual dysfunction reported as an adverse event, whereas only 1 of the nefazodone-treated patients discontinued therapy secondary to sexual dysfunction. In this sample of patients with major depression who had recovered from sexual dysfunction induced by treatment with sertraline, nefazodone treatment resulted in significantly less reemergence of sexual dysfunction than did renewed treatment with sertraline and provided continued antidepressant activity.","In a randomized double-blind study, patients experiencing sexual dysfunction on sertraline improved when switched to nefazodone 400 mg daily."
"Do preparticipation clinical exams reduce morbidity and mortality for athletes
To review available evidence establishing the validity of the preparticipation evaluation (PPE) as a method for screening health risk prior to participation in exercise and sport. Specific emphasis was placed on reviewing original research evaluating methods to screen participants for risk of sudden cardiovascular death. Literature on the current state of the PPE as a screening tool for athletic participation was examined. Electronic databases were searched for articles relating to mass screening for sports participation and sudden cardiac death in athletes published up to January 2004. Databases searched included Medline (OVID Web, 1966-2004), PubMed (1966-2004), Sport Discuss (1975-2004), Current Contents, CISTI Source (1993-2004), Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and EBM Reviews. Additional references from the bibliographies of retrieved articles were also reviewed. All study designs were retrieved, but only those studying athletes and/or student-athletes under age 36 years were reviewed. Of the original research retrieved, the majority of the articles sought to establish incidence or prevalence of cardiovascular causes of sudden death in athletes or the validity of various screening tools. Original research articles seeking to establish the current use of the PPE in all its various forms were also reviewed. All of the articles selected for review consisted of type II, population-based data. The initial literature search identified 639 papers. Of these, 310 articles that met the selection criteria were reviewed, and 25 articles were identified as original research directly relating to the PPE. All of these contained type II evidence-population-based clinical studies. The majority of the literature on the PPE consists of type III evidence-case-based opinion papers and position papers from respected authors and sports medicine societies and reports of expert committees. This literature was also reviewed, but only original research relevant to the PPE is reported in this article. The majority of these studies examined cardiovascular diseases and screening procedures. The 5 studies that assessed the format or effectiveness of the PPE concluded that it was inadequate. The format of the PPE is not standardized and does not consistently address the American Heart Association recommendations for cardiovascular screening history and physical exams. A variety of health care professionals, some without proper training, administer the PPE. The 12 original studies that looked at specific cardiovascular screening techniques were divided on the effectiveness of history, physical examination, electrocardiogram, and echocardiography for detecting cardiovascular risks for sudden death in athletes. A PPE is required by most sport organizations in America, but research as to its effectiveness is very limited. PPEs have been mandatory in Italy for many years, and we can draw on some the data recorded over this time. Otherwise, very few studies in America or elsewhere have been performed on the PPE process. The research available indicates that the PPE is not implemented adequately or uniformly. An opportunity exists to create a standardized, validated PPE that meets medical standards for quality and provides sensitive, specific screening of potential participants in sport and exercise.","A systematic review of the literature on preparticipation evaluation identified 310 studies of athletes age <36 years. The authors searched multiple electronic databases and reviewed the bibliographies of retrieved articles but did not perform hand searches of journals or contact authors directly. The review did not find any prospective cohort or randomized trials addressing the effectiveness of clinical PPE. The 5 studies that assessed the format of the preparticipation evaluation concluded that it is not adequately standardized, does not consistently address the American Heart Association (AHA) recommendations for cardiovascular screening and exam, and is administered by a variety of health care professionals, some without proper training."
"What's the best drug treatment for premature ejaculation
The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to evaluate whether the design and methodology of drug-treatment studies of premature ejaculation affect the efficacy outcome differently. Therefore, methodological, design and efficacy data from 79 studies (3034 males), published between 1943 and 2003, are reviewed. A meta-analysis is performed on 43 selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and clomipramine studies (1514 males), published between 1973 and 2003; these studies were pooled to provide a summary variance-weighted effect size. The antidepressant-induced percentage increase of the intravaginal ejaculation latency time (IELT) was calculated and examined against various methodological items. A significant difference in efficacy between SSRIs was observed. Using daily treatment, paroxetine appeared more effective than the other SSRIs. Retrospective use of a questionnaire, subjective reports, single-blind and open study designs generate far greater variability of ejaculation time both at baseline and during active drug treatment than real time assessment by stopwatch. In conclusion, at daily treatment, the overall efficacy of paroxetine, clomipramine, sertraline and fluoxetine is comparable, but paroxetine exerts the strongest ejaculation delay. Only eight (18.5%) studies on antidepressant treatment fulfilled all criteria used in evidence-based medicine, for example, randomised, double-blind studies with prospective real time (stopwatch) assessment of the IELT at each intercourse. Single-blind studies, open designs, retrospective reporting, or the use of a questionnaire to assess ejaculation time should be avoided.","A meta-analysis of 35 treatment studies with serotonergic antidepressants from 1943 to 2003 shows that, despite major differences in design and drug dosing, clomipramine, fluoxetine (Prozac), paroxetine, and sertraline (Zoloft) significantly delay ejaculation compared with placebo. The percentage increase in IELT was the primary outcome measured. The rank order of efficacy was: 1) paroxetine (1492% IELT increase; 95% confidence interval [CI], 918-2425), 2) sertraline (790% IELT increase; 95% CI, 532-1173), 3) clomipramine (512% IELT increase; 95% CI, 234-1122) and 4) fluoxetine (295% IELT increase; 95% CI, 172-506). Of the 35 studies used, 8 studies (N=263) were prospective, double-blind, real-time stopwatch studies that were separately analyzed in a subsequent meta-analysis. These 8 studies evaluated clomipramine, fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, citalopram (Celexa), fluvoxamine (Luvox), mirtazapine (Remeron), and nefazodone (Serzone) against placebo. Paroxetine (783% IELT increase, 95% CI, 499-1228), clomipramine (360% IELT increase, 95% CI, 200-435), sertraline (313%, 95% CI, 161-608), and fluoxetine (295%, 95% CI, 200-435) exerted a significant delay in the IELT compared with placebo."
"Can patients with steatohepatitis take statins
Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a serious disorder with the potential to gradually progress to cirrhosis. It is generally associated with obesity, diabetes and hyperlipidemia. Currently, there is no established therapy for NASH. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness of atorvastatin and ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) in the treatment of NASH. This prospective study included 44 adult patients (24 men, 20 women) with a mean age of 48.90+/-7.69 years and mean body mass index (BMI) of 29.40+/-3.82. Ten patients had a history of diabetes. Serological markers for viral hepatitis were negative in all patients and there was no history of alcohol or drug abuse. Patients who had autoimmune hepatitis were excluded from the study. Liver biopsy was performed before therapy to confirm the diagnosis. Among NASH patients, 17 normolipidemic cases received UDCA 13 to 15 mg/kg/day (group 1), while hyperlipidemic cases (n=27) received atorvastatin 10 mg/day (group 2) for six months. The BMI, serum lipids, liver function tests and liver density, assessed by computerized tomography, were evaluated before and after the treatment period. The BMI, serum aminotransferase levels, histological parameters (steatosis, inflammation, fibrosis scores) and liver densities were not statistically different between the groups at the beginning of therapy. The BMI, serum glucose, and triglyceride levels did not change in either group after the treatment period. In group 1, serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and gamma-glutamyl-transferase (GGT) levels reduced significantly, and in group 2, serum cholesterol, aspartate aminotransferase, ALT, alkaline phosphatase and GGT levels reduced significantly. Liver densities increased only in group 2, probably as a result of diminishing fat content of liver. The normalization of transaminases was also more prevalent in group 2. Liver steatosis was closely correlated with liver density, but inflammation and fibrosis were not. The use of atorvastatin in NASH patients with hyperlipidemia was found to be both effective and safe. The benefit of statin and UDCA therapy in normolipidemic patients with NASH requires confirmation with further placebo-controlled trials.","A 6-month unblinded study found similar results among 44 adult patients with biopsy-confirmed NASH. Twenty-seven hyperlipidemic patients (aged 50Â±1.4 years) with an average alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 81.8 U/L took 10 mg of atorvastatin daily. Seventeen normolipidemic patients (aged 43.7Â±1.8 years) with an average alanine transaminase of 76.0 U/L took ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) 13-15 mg/kg/d for the same duration; 59% of atorvastatin-treated patients normalized liver enzyme levels compared with 23% in the UDCA group. On computed tomography scanning, both groups showed improvement in liver densities, suggesting improvement of fatty liver."
"How should we manage a patient with a positive PPD and prior BCG vaccination
The tuberculin skin test for immunologic diagnosis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection has many limitations, including being confounded by bacillus Calmette-GuÃ©rin (BCG) vaccination or exposure to nontuberculous mycobacteria. M. tuberculosis-specific antigens that are absent from BCG and most nontuberculous mycobacteria have been identified. We examined the use of two of these antigens, CFP-10 and ESAT-6, in a whole blood IFN-gamma assay as a diagnostic test for tuberculosis in BCG-vaccinated individuals. Because of the lack of an accurate standard with which to compare new tests for M. tuberculosis infection, specificity of the whole blood IFN-gamma assay was estimated on the basis of data from people with no identified risk for M. tuberculosis exposure (216 BCG-vaccinated Japanese adults) and sensitivity was estimated on the basis of data from 118 patients with culture-confirmed M. tuberculosis infection who had received less than 1 week of treatment. Using a combination of CFP-10 and ESAT-6 responses, the specificity of the test for the low-risk group was 98.1% and the sensitivity for patients with M. tuberculosis infection was 89.0%. The results demonstrate that the whole blood IFN-gamma assay using CFP-10 and ESAT-6 was highly specific and sensitive for M. tuberculosis infection and was unaffected by BCG vaccination status.",A Japanese study of 216 BCG-vaccinated individuals showed interferon-gamma assays to be 98.1% specific. The same study reported 89.0% sensitivity for the combination of 2 interferon-gamma assays among 118 tuberculosis culture-confirmed individuals.
"What is the best management for patients who have a TIA while on aspirin therapy
We report the results of the Ticlopidine Aspirin Stroke Study, a blinded trial at 56 North American centers that compared the effects of ticlopidine hydrochloride (500 mg daily) with those of aspirin (1300 mg daily) on the risk of stroke or death. The medications were randomly assigned to 3069 patients with recent transient or mild persistent focal cerebral or retinal ischemia. Follow-up lasted for two to six years. The three-year event rate for nonfatal stroke or death from any cause was 17 percent for ticlopidine and 19 percent for aspirin--a 12 percent risk reduction (95 percent confidence interval, -2 to 26 percent) with ticlopidine (P = 0.048 for cumulative Kaplan-Meier estimates). The rates of fatal and nonfatal stroke at three years were 10 percent for ticlopidine and 13 percent for aspirin--a 21 percent risk reduction (95 percent confidence interval, 4 to 38 percent) with ticlopidine (P = 0.024 for cumulative Kaplan-Meier estimates). Ticlopidine was more effective than aspirin in both sexes. The adverse effects of aspirin included diarrhea (10 percent), rash (5.5 percent), peptic ulceration (3 percent), gastritis (2 percent), and gastrointestinal bleeding (1 percent). With ticlopidine, diarrhea (20 percent), skin rash (14 percent), and severe but reversible neutropenia (less than 1 percent) were noted. The mean increase in total cholesterol level was 9 percent with ticlopidine and 2 percent with aspirin (P less than 0.01). The ratios of high-density lipoprotein and low-density lipoprotein to total cholesterol were similar in both treatment groups. We conclude that ticlopidine was somewhat more effective than aspirin in preventing strokes in this population, although the risks of side effects were greater.","An randomized controlled trials studying secondary prevention of stroke, in which 50% of the study population experienced a TIA as their qualifying event, concluded that ticlopidine (Ticlid) reduced the risk of stroke by 21% (95% CI, 0.04-0.38; P=.024)."
"How soon should serum potassium levels be monitored for patients started on diuretics
In a study of 50 patients with uncomplicated arterial hypertension the administration of hydrochlorothiazide, 50 to 100 mg daily or every other day, with or without reserpine, 0.25 mg daily, resulted in a fall in the mean blood pressure from 182/113 to 144/92 mm Hg. The mean duration of therapy was 19 months. The mean serum potassium concentration was 4.3 mmol/l before the onset of therapy. It fell during the first 6 weeks of treatment, but seldom below 3.5 mmol/l, then rose gradually and spontaneously to 4.1 mmol/l after 19 months of therapy. All the patients remained asymptomatic. These findings bring into question the routine use of potassium supplements or a potassium-sparing diuretic, such as spironolactone or triamterene, during the treatment of hypertension with diuretics such as the thiazides. The use of potassium supplements or a potassium-sparing agent may induce hyperkalemia in spite of the simultaneous administration of a diuretic that acts more proximally. Since hyperkalemia is potentially lethal, the serum potassium concentration should be carefully monitored in any patient receiving potassium supplements or a potassium-sparing agent.","Lemieux and colleagues followed 50 patients receiving a variety of diuretic regimens (hydrochlorothiazide 50 to 100 mg daily or every other day with or without reserpine 0.25 mg daily). Only 3 patients in this group had potassium levels below 3.5 mmol/L, and all decreases were only transient. Peters and coworkers6 documented potassium levels below 3.5 mEq/L in 6 of 19 patients taking hydrochlorothiazide 25 or 50 mg for 20 weeks. Three of these patients normalized without therapy. One of these transiently hypokalemic patients was also taking triamterene, a potassium-sparing diuretic. Potassium-sparing diuretics may not free the clinician from checking a potassium level, however."
"When are empiric antibiotics appropriate for urinary tract infection symptoms
Symptoms suggestive of acute urinary tract infection (UTI) constitute one of the most common reasons for women to visit clinicians. Although the clinical encounter typically involves taking a history and performing a physical examination, the diagnostic accuracy of the clinical assessment for UTI remains uncertain. To review the accuracy and precision of history taking and physical examination for the diagnosis of UTI in women. We conducted a MEDLINE search for articles published from 1966 through September 2001 and manually reviewed bibliographies, 3 commonly used clinical skills textbooks, and contacted experts in the field. Studies were included if they contained original data on the accuracy or precision of history or physical examination for diagnosing acute uncomplicated UTI in women. One author initially screened titles and abstracts found by our search. Nine of 464 identified studies met inclusion criteria. Two authors independently abstracted data from the included studies. Disagreements were resolved by discussion and consensus with a third author. Four symptoms and 1 sign significantly increased the probability of UTI: dysuria (summary positive likelihood ratio [LR], 1.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2-2.0), frequency (LR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.1-3.0), hematuria (LR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.3-2.9), back pain (LR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.2-2.1), and costovertebral angle tenderness (LR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.1-2.5). Four symptoms and 1 sign significantly decreased the probability of UTI: absence of dysuria (summary negative LR, 0.5; 95% CI, 0.3-0.7), absence of back pain (LR, 0.8; 95% CI, 0.7-0.9), history of vaginal discharge (LR, 0.3; 95% CI, 0.1-0.9), history of vaginal irritation (LR, 0.2; 95% CI, 0.1-0.9), and vaginal discharge on examination (LR, 0.7; 95% CI, 0.5-0.9). Of all individual diagnostic signs and symptoms, the 2 most powerful were history of vaginal discharge and history of vaginal irritation, which significantly decreased the likelihood of UTI when present (LRs, 0.3 and 0.2, respectively). One study examined combinations of symptoms, and the resulting LRs were more powerful (24.6 for the combination of dysuria and frequency but no vaginal discharge or irritation). One study of patients with recurrent UTI found that self-diagnosis significantly increased the probability of UTI (LR, 4.0). In women who present with 1 or more symptoms of UTI, the probability of infection is approximately 50%. Specific combinations of symptoms (eg, dysuria and frequency without vaginal discharge or irritation) raise the probability of UTI to more than 90%, effectively ruling in the diagnosis based on history alone. In contrast, history taking, physical examination, and dipstick urinalysis are not able to reliably lower the posttest probability of disease to a level where a UTI can be ruled out when a patient presents with 1 or more symptoms.",A patient presenting to a clinician with 1 or more urinary tract infection symptoms had approximately a 50% chance of having significant bacteriuria on culture. The authors estimated the pretest probability of urinary tract infection as 5% from the incidence of asymptomatic bacteriuria among healthy women. This produced a LR+ of 19 simply for presenting to a clinician with 1 or more urinary tract infection symptoms.
"Are there any known health risks to early introduction of solids to an infant's diet
To assess the relations between early introduction of solid food and infant weight, gastrointestinal illness, and allergic illnesses during the first two years of life. Prospective observational study of infants followed up for 24 months after birth. Community setting in Dundee. 671 newborn infants, of whom 455 were still available for study at 2 years of age. Infants' diet, weight, and incidence of gastrointestinal illness, respiratory illness, napkin dermatitis, and eczema at 2 weeks and 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, and 24 months of age. The infants given solid food at an early age (at < 8 weeks or 8-12 weeks) were heavier than those introduced to solids later (after 12 weeks) at 4, 8, 13, and 26 weeks of age (p < 0.01) but not at 52 and 104 weeks. At their first solid feed those given solids early were heavier than infants of similar age who had not yet received solids. The incidence of gastrointestinal illness, wheeze, and nappy dermatitis was not related to early introduction of solids. There was a significant but less than twofold increase in respiratory illness at 14-26 weeks of age and persistent cough at 14-26 and 27-39 weeks of age among the infants given solids early. The incidence of eczema was increased in the infants who received solids at 8-12 weeks of age. Early introduction of solid food to infants is less harmful than was previously reported. Longer follow up is needed, but, meanwhile, a more relaxed approach to early feeding with solids should be considered.","A cohort study (N=455) in Dundee, Scotland, reported that infants fed solids before 12 weeks were ""significantly heavier"" at 26 weeks but not at 52 or 104 weeks; this finding has limited validity, however, because the study did not control for parental weight. The Dundee study also found no significant association between gastrointestinal illness and the timing of introduction of solids."
"Does digoxin decrease morbidity for those in sinus rhythm with heart failure
The Digitalis Investigation Group trial reported that treatment with digoxin did not decrease overall mortality among patients with heart failure and depressed left ventricular systolic function, although it did reduce hospitalizations slightly. Even though the epidemiologic features, causes, and prognosis of heart failure vary between men and women, sex-based differences in the effect of digoxin were not evaluated. We conducted a post hoc subgroup analysis to assess whether there were sex-based differences in the effect of digoxin therapy among the 6800 patients in the Digitalis Investigation Group study. The presence of an interaction between sex and digoxin therapy with respect to the primary end point of death from any cause was evaluated with the use of Mantel-Haenszel tests of heterogeneity and a multivariable Cox proportional-hazards model, adjusted for demographic and clinical variables. There was an absolute difference of 5.8 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 0.5 to 11.1) between men and women in the effect of digoxin on the rate of death from any cause (P=0.034 for the interaction). Specifically, women who were randomly assigned to digoxin had a higher rate of death than women who were randomly assigned to placebo (33.1 percent vs. 28.9 percent; absolute difference, 4.2 percent, 95 percent confidence interval, -0.5 to 8.8). In contrast, the rate of death was similar among men randomly assigned to digoxin and men randomly assigned to placebo (35.2 percent vs. 36.9 percent; absolute difference, -1.6 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, -4.2 to 1.0). In the multivariable analysis, digoxin was associated with a significantly higher risk of death among women (adjusted hazard ratio for the comparison with placebo, 1.23; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.02 to 1.47), but it had no significant effect among men (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.93; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.85 to 1.02; P=0.014 for the interaction). The effect of digoxin therapy differs between men and women. Digoxin therapy is associated with an increased risk of death from any cause among women, but not men, with heart failure and depressed left ventricular systolic function.","A post-hoc subgroup analysis focusing only on sex-based differences in the digoxigenin trial suggested women benefit less than men from reduced hospitalizations: -4.2% (95% CI, -8.9 to 0.5) vs -8.9% (95% CI, -11.4 to -6.5) (P=.053). When a multivariable analysis was performed, digoxin use for women was associated with a higher risk of mortality (adjusted hazard ratio vs placebo=1.23; 95% CI, 1.02-1.47)."
"Are nasal steroid sprays effective for otitis media with effusion
Forty-five children aged two to 10 years with persistent eustachian tube dysfunction received a three-week course of aerosolized nasal dexamethasone phosphate or placebo. Patients were randomly assigned to the drug or placebo group and received one spray in each nostril three times a day for three weeks. Middle ear pressure and gradient were assessed with tympanometry. Tympanic membrane mobility, position and presence of middle ear fluid were assessed by the investigators initially and at weekly intervals during the study. Fasting morning plasma cortisol levels were obtained prior to starting the study and at its conclusion. The dexamethasone-treated group showed a significant increase in patients with normal middle ear pressure compared to placebo after one week and a significant increase in the number of patients with normal middle ear gradient at the second week. By the conclusion of the study there were no significant differences between the groups. Within the dexamethasone group, however, there were statistically significant increases in patients achieving normal middle ear pressure, tympanic membrane mobility and position in one or both ears. Plasma cortisol levels fluctuated widely from one determination to another and did not show an over-all declining trend for the dexamethasone group. However, two dexamethasone patients had a transient fall in cortisol level to below the normal range. These results support some therapeutic efficacy for nasal aerosolized dexamethasone but also point out the therapeutic value of time alone. The observation that most improvement occurred in the first two weeks and that some worrisome cortisol changes occurred suggests that dexamethasone therapy should be limited to two weeks and be undertaken with caution.","The Shapiro study enrolled children who had documented allergic rhinitis and OME with failure to respond to 4 weeks of oral antihistamine and decongestant therapy at time of entry. This was the only study with short-term follow-up comparing intranasal steroids with control. The odds ratio for OME persisting after 3 weeks was 2.12 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.65-6.90)."
"Which oral antifungal is best for toenail onychomycosis
Diabetes mellitus (DM) affects an estimated 175 million people world-wide. Approximately one-third of patients with DM have toenail onychomycosis. To determine the efficacy and safety of terbinafine treatment of toenail onychomycosis in patients with DM receiving insulin and/or oral antidiabetic agents. Special interest was focused on potential drug interactions with oral hypoglycaemic substances. In a multicentre trial, patients suffering from insulin-dependent DM (IDDM) or non- insulin-dependent DM (NIDDM) with toenail onychomycosis were treated for 12 weeks with oral terbinafine 250 mg daily and followed up to 48 weeks. In addition to clinical, mycological and laboratory investigations, blood glucose levels were monitored. At the end of the trial (week 48), a mycological cure rate of 73% was achieved. The rates of clinical cure and complete cure (mycological cure plus clinical cure) were 57% and 48%, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference between the NIDDM and IDDM groups with respect to the cure rates (P > 0.05). No hypoglycaemic episode was reported and none of the patients had hypoglycaemia during the treatment phase. With excellent cure rates and a good tolerability profile, terbinafine should continue to be a drug of choice for the treatment of toenail onychomycosis in the rising number of NIDDM patients receiving multiple medication.","A multicenter trial of diabetic patients with onychomycosis (meanÂ±SD age, 55.7Â±11.7 years) revealed that terbinafine had comparable efficacy and caused no hypoglycemic reactions in this group, who were being treated with insulin or oral hypoglycemics."
"What are appropriate screening tests for infants and children
Although the benefits of vision screening seem intuitive, the value of such programmes in junior and senior schools has been questioned. In addition to this there exists a lack of clarity regarding the optimum age, and frequency at which to carry out screening. The objective of this review is to evaluate the effectiveness of vision screening programmes carried out in schools in reducing the prevalence of undetected, correctable visual acuity deficits due to refractive error in school-age children. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials - CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) on The Cochrane Library (Issue 3 2004), MEDLINE (1966 to August 2004) and EMBASE (1980 to August 2004). No language or date restrictions were placed on these searches. To date it has not been possible to carry out any manual searches but it is hoped to include these in a future update. We planned to include randomised controlled trials including randomised cluster controlled trials. Two reviewers independently assessed study abstracts identified by the electronic searches. No trials were identified that met the inclusion criteria. As no trials were identified, no formal analysis was performed. A narrative synthesis of other retrieved studies was undertaken in order to explain current practice. At present there are no robust trials available that allow the benefits of school vision screening to be measured. The disadvantage of attending school with a visual acuity deficit also needs to be quantified. The impact of a screening programme will depend on the geographical, and socio-economic setting in which it is conducted. There is therefore clearly a need for well planned randomised controlled trials, in various settings, to be undertaken so that the potential benefits and harms of vision screening can be measured.","A Cochrane review of this topic showed insufficient evidence for visual screening of older (school-aged) children; for amblyopia, no data sufficient for analysis was found."
"At what age do patients no longer need colorectal cancer screening
Although tests for occult blood in the feces are widely used to screen for colorectal cancers, there is no conclusive evidence that they reduce mortality from this cause. We evaluated a fecal occult-blood test in a randomized trial and documented its effectiveness. We randomly assigned 46,551 participants 50 to 80 years of age to screening for colorectal cancer once a year, to screening every two years, or to a control group. Participants who were screened submitted six guaiac-impregnated paper slides with two smears from each of three consecutive stools. About 83 percent of the slides were rehydrated. Participants who tested positive underwent a diagnostic evaluation that included colonoscopy. Vital status was ascertained for all study participants during 13 years of follow-up. A committee determined causes of death. A single pathologist determined the stage of each tissue specimen. Differences in mortality from colorectal cancer, the primary study end point, were monitored with the sequential log-rank statistic. The 13-year cumulative mortality per 1000 from colorectal cancer was 5.88 in the annually screened group (95 percent confidence interval, 4.61 to 7.15), 8.33 in the biennially screened group (95 percent confidence interval, 6.82 to 9.84), and 8.83 in the control group (95 percent confidence interval, 7.26 to 10.40). The rate in the annually screened group, but not in the biennially screened group, was significantly lower than that in the control group. Reduced mortality in the annually screened group was accompanied by improved survival in those with colorectal cancer and a shift to detection at an earlier stage of cancer. Annual fecal occult-blood testing with rehydration of the samples decreased the 13-year cumulative mortality from colorectal cancer by 33 percent.","The upper age limits of patients was 80. In the study that included subjects to age 80, only 13% were older than 70 years."
"Do antiarrhythmics prevent sudden death in patients with heart failure
There have been 13 randomised controlled trials of prophylactic amiodarone in patients with recent myocardial infarction (MI) or congestive heart failure (CHF). None of these was powered to detect a mortality reduction of about 20%. We undertook a meta-analysis, based on data from individual patients, to provide a more sensitive and accurate assessment of the benefits and risks of prophylactic amiodarone. Individual data from the studies were abstracted according to a predefined protocol. The summary odds ratios were calculated according to standard methods. There were eight post-MI and five CHF trials; nine trials were double-blind and placebo-controlled, and four compared amiodarone with usual care. 6553 patients were randomly assigned treatment, of which 78% were in post-MI trials and 22% in CHF trials. 89% had had previous MI. The mean left-ventricular ejection fraction was 31%, and median frequency of ventricular premature depolarisation 18 per h. Total mortality was reduced by 13% (odds ratio 0.87 [95% CI 0.78-0.99], p = 0.030) based on classic fixed-effects meta-analysis and by 15% (0.85 [0.71-1.02], p = 0.081) with the more conservative random-effects approach. Arrhythmic/sudden death was reduced by 29% (0.71 [0.59-0.85], p = 0.0003). There was no effect on non-arrhythmic deaths (1.02 [0.87-1.19], p = 0.84). There was no difference in treatment effect between post-MI and CHF studies. The risk of arrhythmic/sudden death in control-group patients was higher in CHF than in post-MI studies (10.7 vs 4.1%), and the best single predictor of risk of arrhythmic/sudden death among all patients was symptomatic CHF. The excess (amiodarone minus control) risk of pulmonary toxicity was 1% per year. Prophylactic amiodarone reduces the rate of arrhythmic/sudden death in high-risk patients with recent MI or CHF and this effect results in an overall reduction of 13% in total mortality.","Possible benefits must be balanced against the risk of harm from amiodarone, including excess rates of pulmonary infiltrate (1.1% per year), thyroid dysfunction (6.8% per year), liver enzyme abnormalities (0.6% per year), neuropathy (0.3% per year), and bradycardia (1.6% per year), as well as a discontinuation rate of 41% compared with 27% for placebo."
"What measures relieve postherpetic neuralgia
A systematic review of the literature on postherpetic neuralgia was performed. The authors identified studies using the National Library of Medicine's Medline database and Cochrane Library database. The authors determined absolute reduction rate, number needed to treat (NNT), 95% CI for NNT, and number needed to harm (NNH) for successful therapies of postherpetic neuralgia. Tricyclic antidepressants, gabapentin, pregabalin, opioids, and lidocaine patch were found to be effective in reducing the pain of postherpetic neuralgia.","A systematic review found that controlled-release oxycodone reduced pain by 50%, based on the VAS. Tramadol, a selective opioid agonist, showed moderate effectiveness in a small randomized controlled trials (N=125), with an number needed to treat of 4.76 (95% CI, 2.61-26.97)."
"What is the best way to manage benign paroxysmal positional vertigo
'Vestibular rehabilitation' (VR) is an increasingly popular treatment option for patients with persistent dizziness. Previous clinical trials have only evaluated the effects of specialist therapy programmes in small, selective, or uncontrolled patient samples. To determine the benefits of VR compared with standard medical care, using a brief intervention for dizzy patients in primary care. Adults consulting their general practitioner (GP) with dizziness or vertigo were randomly assigned to treatment or control groups. Patients in both groups received the same evaluation at baseline, six-week follow-up, and six-month follow-up, comprising examination of nystagmus, postural control, and movement-provoked dizziness, and a questionnaire assessment of subjective status, symptoms, handicap, anxiety, and depression. At baseline and six weeks later, the treatment group also received an individualized 30-minute therapy session, in which they were taught head, eye, and body exercises designed to promote vestibular compensation and enhance skill and confidence in balance. The treatment group (n = 67) improved on all measures, whereas the control group (n = 76) showed no improvement, resulting in a significant difference between the two groups on physical indices of balance and subjective indices of symptoms and distress. Odds ratios for improvement in treated patients relative to untreated patients were 3.1:1 at six weeks (95% CI = 1.4-6.8) and 3.8:1 at six months (95% CI = 1.6-8.7). VR is a simple, inexpensive, and beneficial treatment, and may be an appropriate first stage of management for many dizzy patients in primary care.","In a trial of vestibular rehabilitation for prolonged, undifferentiated dizziness, patients were randomized to usual care (n=76) or treatment with two 30-minute home education sessions at baseline and 6 weeks (n=67). A nurse, who had received 2 weeks of training, led the sessions, which included basic education on the vestibular system, causes of dizziness, and the rationale for exercise therapy. The nurse then taught the patients 8 sets of standard head and body movements to be performed twice daily. At 6 months, 69% of the treatment group vs 37% of the control group reported subjective improvement (OR=3.8 at 6 months; 95% CI, 1.6-8.7)."
"What screening tests should you use to evaluate a man with low testosterone
Male osteoporosis represents an important, although long underestimated, public health problem. Both in men and in women aging is accompanied by continuous bone loss and by an exponential increase in the incidence of osteoporotic fracture, with a female to male incidence ratio of about 2 to 3 to 1 in the elderly for hip and vertebral fractures. Morbidity after osteoporotic fractures appears to be more serious and mortality more common in men than in women. To date, no single treatment has been proved to be effective and safe in published prospective studies. The present report, based on a systematic search of the literature on male osteoporosis, summarises the state of the art on the clinical consequences of male osteoporosis and its risk factors, in relation to the present state of knowledge about female osteoporosis. This constitutes the background for the design of rational clinical development strategies for therapeutic interventions in male osteoporosis. From this review of the literature it is apparent that notwithstanding the existing sex differences in pathophysiology of osteoporosis and the difference in age-specific incidence of osteoporotic fractures, there are also important similarities between osteoporosis in women and men. The higher incidence of fracture in women than in men results from quantitative differences in risk factors rather than from different risk factors. Even though there are sex differences in bone geometry, incidence of fracture seems to be similar in men and women for a same absolute areal bone mineral density. However, the lack of data on the changes in fracture rates in men resulting from pharmacological intervention, leading to changes in bone mineral density or bone turnover, remains the main limitation for extrapolation of established treatment outcomes from women to men.","Because chronic hypogonadism leads to low bone density and increased risk of fracture, baseline bone densitometry may be prudent."
"What are contraindications to IUDs
This study aimed to assess the prevalence of bacterial vaginosis (BV) and other cervicovaginal infections, as well as the incidence of complications among new users of IUD, 1 and 6 months after its insertion, in the City of Campinas, Brazil. A total of 223 women who had a TCu-380A IUD inserted from May through November 2001, were included in the study. After the IUD insertion all women were scheduled to two additional visits: after 1 month and after 6 months, when they were interviewed and a pelvic examination was performed, along with a collection of specimens from the vagina and the endocervix for laboratory testing. The Nugent's criterion was used for the BV diagnosis. They were also evaluated with regard to presence of complications possibly related to IUD insertion and use, i.e., abnormal bleeding, dysmenorrhea, expulsion and pelvic inflammatory disease. The prevalence of cervicovaginal infections was 29.1%, BV being the most frequent (19.7%). Dysmenorrhea was more frequent among women with BV than among women without BV (p = 0.03). A trend of abnormal bleeding being more frequent among women with BV was also found. In conclusion, BV after 1 month of IUD insertion was not associated with IUD complications, with the exception of dysmenorrhea.","Bacterial vaginosis may increase dysmenorrhea for women with IUDs (34.8 vs 13.9%, P=.03)."
"Does anticoagulation prevent thrombosis for persons with fractures distal to the hip
The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in patients immobilized in plaster cast and the possible efficacy of prophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH). The study was a randomized, assessor-blinded, open multicenter (three centers) study. All patients over 18 years of age with planned plaster cast on a lower extremity of at least 3 weeks were eligible for participation. Written informed consent was obtained from 300 patients and they were randomized to either 3.500 IU anti-Xa of tinzaparin (Innohep) subcutaneously once daily or no prophylaxis. On the day the cast was removed, ascending unilateral venography was performed. Two experienced radiologists, unaware of treatment, assessed the pictures independently. The radiologist had to obtain consensus as to whether DVT was present or not. 300 patients were included (148 in the treatment group and 152 in the control group). Ninety-five were subsequently withdrawn. DVT was diagnosed in 10/99 patients in the treatment group and in 18/106 patients in the control group. This difference is not significant (P=.15, chi(2) test) and the odds ratio was 0.55 (95% confidence interval=0.34-1.26). DVT in legs after plaster casting is a big problem, with an incidence of almost 20%. An effective prophylactic regime is required. Once-daily dose of 3.500 IU anti-Xa of tinzaparin was not sufficient.","An randomized controlled trials evaluated tinzaparin (yet another European LMWH) in 300 adult outpatients immobilized in plaster for at least 3 weeks. Most patients (205 out of 300) underwent venography, and the overall deep venous thrombosis rate was 10% (tinzaparin) vs 17% (controls). Among the 150 fracture patients who underwent venography, the deep venous thrombosis rate was 11% (tinzaparin) vs 13% (controls). This difference was not significant, probably due to insufficient numbers. None of the DVTs was clinically detectable."
"When should a child with an undescended testis be referred to a urologist
In a cohort of Danish boys characterized by (1) being born between 1941 and 1957, (2) having attended schools in a defined area of Denmark, and (3) having a school health record available, 183 were registered in the Danish Cancer Registry with testicular cancer diagnosed before January 1, 1985. We selected 366 age- and sex-matched controls from the same cohort. Using information recorded by school physicians, we performed logistic regression analyses to estimate the relative risks (RR) associated with various genital anomalies. We found the risk for testicular cancer to be raised for men with a history of cryptorchidism [RR = 5.2; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 2.1-13.0], inguinal hernia (RR = 1.8; 95% CI = 0.9-3.7), hypospadias (RR = 4.2; 95% CI = 0.4-42.7), and hydrocele (RR = 2.4; 95% CI = 0.6-9.0). We observed no decrease in the risk associated with cryptorchidism after correction of the maldescent in early childhood. The RR of testicular cancer in the contralateral, normally descended testis in unilateral cryptorchid men was increased to 3.6. The results add to the growing evidence for a common causal factor for both testicular cancer and cryptorchidism and support the findings from other studies of associations between other genital anomalies involving the closure of the processus vaginalis and the risk of testicular cancer.","A cohort study of boys with cryptorchidism showed an increased risk of testicular cancer (relative risk=5.2). However, risk did not decrease after orchiopexy in early childhood."
"Which imaging modality is best for suspected stroke
To determine the cost-effectiveness of computed tomographic (CT) scanning after acute stroke. To assess the contribution of brain imaging to the diagnosis and management of stroke, and to estimate the costs, benefits and risks of different imaging strategies in order to provide data to inform national and local policy on the use of brain imaging in stroke. A decision-analysis model was developed to represent the pathway of care in acute stroke using 'scan all patients within 48 hours' as the comparator against which to cost 12 alternative scan strategies. Hospitals in Scotland. Subjects were patients admitted to hospital with a first stroke and those managed as outpatients. The effect on functional outcome after ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke, tumours or infections, of correctly administered antithrombotic or other treatment; of time to scan and stroke severity on diagnosis by CT or MRI; on management, including length of stay, functional outcome, and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), of the diagnostic information provided by CT scanning; the cost-effectiveness (cost versus QALYs) of different strategies for use of CT after acute stroke. Death and functional outcome at long-term follow-up; accuracy of CT and MRI; cost of CT scanning by time of day and week; effect of CT diagnosis on change in health outcome, length of stay in hospital and QALYs; cost-effectiveness of various scanning strategies. CT is very sensitive and specific for haemorrhage within the first 8 days of stroke only. Suboptimal scanning used in epidemiology studies suggests that the frequency of primary intracerebral haemorrhage (PICH) has been underestimated. Aspirin increases the risk of PICH. There were no reliable data on functional outcome or on the effect of antithrombotic treatment given long term after PICH. In 60% of patients with recurrent stroke after PICH, the cause is another PICH and mortality is high among PICH patients. A specific MR sequence (gradient echo) is required to identify prior PICH reliably. CT scanners were distributed unevenly in Scotland, 65% provided CT scanning within 48 hours of stroke, and 100% within 7 days for hospital-admitted patients, but access out of hours was very variable, and for outpatients was poor. The average cost of a CT brain scan for stroke was pounds 30.23 to pounds 89.56 in normal working hours and pounds 55.05 to pounds 173.46 out of hours. Average length of stay was greatest for severe strokes and those who survived in a dependent state. For a cohort of 1000 patients aged 70-74 years, the policy 'scan all strokes within 48 hours', cost pounds 10,279,728 and achieved 1982.3 QALYS. The most cost-effective strategy was 'scan all immediately' (pounds 9,993,676 and 1982.4 QALYS). The least cost-effective was to 'scan patients on anticoagulants, in a life-threatening condition immediately and the rest within 14 days'. In general, strategies in which most patients were scanned immediately cost least and achieved the most QALYs, as the cost of providing CT (even out of hours) was less than the cost of inpatient care. Increasing independent survival by even a small proportion through early use of aspirin in the majority with ischaemic stroke, avoiding aspirin in those with haemorrhagic stroke, and appropriate early management of those who have not had a stroke, reduced costs and increased QALYs.","The British National Health Service Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Programme published a systematic review on optimal brain imaging strategies for the diagnosis of stroke in July 2004. The HTA searched Medline and EMBASE from 1980 to 1999 and found 1903 studies relevant to diagnostic imaging for stroke. Only 25 studies reported the type of stroke diagnosed and the imaging reference standard. Thirteen of these 25 studies describe the time interval from symptom onset to imaging. The Programme advises ""scan all immediately"" for diagnosing new neurological deficits with the understanding that computerized tomography scans were most available and cost-effective."
"What is the best treatment for hypertension in African Americans
It is known that obesity, sodium intake, and alcohol consumption factors influence blood pressure. In this clinical trial, Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension, we assessed the effects of dietary patterns on blood pressure. We enrolled 459 adults with systolic blood pressures of less than 160 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressures of 80 to 95 mm Hg. For three weeks, the subjects were fed a control diet that was low in fruits, vegetables, and dairy products, with a fat content typical of the average diet in the United States. They were then randomly assigned to receive for eight weeks the control diet, a diet rich in fruits and vegetables, or a ""combination"" diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy products and with reduced saturated and total fat. Sodium intake and body weight were maintained at constant levels. At base line, the mean (+/-SD) systolic and diastolic blood pressures were 131.3+/-10.8 mm Hg and 84.7+/-4.7 mm Hg, respectively. The combination diet reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressure by 5.5 and 3.0 mm Hg more, respectively, than the control diet (P<0.001 for each); the fruits-and-vegetables diet reduced systolic blood pressure by 2.8 mm Hg more (P<0.001) and diastolic blood pressure by 1.1 mm Hg more than the control diet (P=0.07). Among the 133 subjects with hypertension (systolic pressure, > or =140 mm Hg; diastolic pressure, > or =90 mm Hg; or both), the combination diet reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressure by 11.4 and 5.5 mm Hg more, respectively, than the control diet (P<0.001 for each); among the 326 subjects without hypertension, the corresponding reductions were 3.5 mm Hg (P<0.001) and 2.1 mm Hg (P=0.003). A diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy foods and with reduced saturated and total fat can substantially lower blood pressure. This diet offers an additional nutritional approach to preventing and treating hypertension.","An randomized controlled trials compared the effects of consuming the DASH diet (consisting of 4-5 servings of fruit, 4-5 servings of vegetables, 2-3 servings of low-fat dairy per day, and <25% fat) with a typical high-fat control diet among 459 adults with normal or elevated blood pressure. Among 133 patients with hypertension, the DASH diet reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressure by 11.4 mm Hg (97.5% confidence interval [CI], -15.9 to -6.9) and 5.5 mm Hg (97.5% CI, -8.2 to -2.7) respectively when compared with the control diet."
"Does surgery for carpal tunnel syndrome improve outcomes
Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is a common disorder for which several surgical treatment options are available. However, there is no consensus on the most effective method of treatment. The object of this systematic review is to compare the efficacy of the various surgical techniques in relieving the symptoms of CTS and promoting return to work and/or activities of daily living. Computer-aided searches of Medline, EMBASE and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register were conducted, together with reference checking. A rating system, based on the number of studies and their methodological quality and findings, was used to determine the strength of the available evidence for the efficacy of the treatment. Fourteen studies were included in the review. None of the alternatives to standard open carpal tunnel release (OCTR) seems to offer better relief of symptoms. There is conflicting evidence about whether endoscopic carpal tunnel release results in earlier return to work and/or activities of daily living. Standard OCTR is still the preferred method of treatment for CTS. It is just as effective as the alternatives, but is technically less demanding, so incurs a lower risk of complications and of added costs.","One systematic review of 14 RCTs comparing types of surgical therapies for carpal tunnel syndrome concluded that none of the alternative surgical procedures, including closed endoscopic release, appeared to give better symptom relief than open release; and that the evidence is conflicting as to whether endoscopic release results in earlier return to work or improved level of function."
"Which strategies work best to prevent obesity in adults
To conduct a descriptive systematic review into the nature and effectiveness of family involvement in weight control, weight maintenance and weight-loss interventions. We searched Medline and Psyclit for English language papers describing randomised trials with at least 1-y follow-up that evaluated interventions incorporating a family-based component. Studies involving people with eating disorders, learning disabilities and undernutrition or malnutrition were excluded. Data were extracted on characteristics of the participants, study design, target behaviours, nature of the intervention and study outcomes. A taxonomy was developed and used to classify family involvement in behaviour change interventions. Interventions were also classified according to an existing taxonomy that characterised the behaviour change techniques employed. A total of 21 papers describing 16 intervention studies were identified. Studies were small (mean sample size: 52), heterogeneous, poorly described but with few losses to follow-up (median 15%). The majority were North American and aimed at weight loss. Few studies described a theoretical underpinning to the behaviour change techniques employed. There was a suggestion that spouse involvement increased effectiveness but that adolescents achieved greater weight loss when treated alone. In studies including children, beneficial effects were seen when greater numbers of behaviour change techniques were taught to both parents and children. Relatively few intervention studies exist in this important area, particularly studies targeting adolescents, and they highlight continued uncertainty about how best to involve family members. The studies provide limited support for the involvement of spouses. They suggest that parental involvement is associated with weight loss in children, and that use of a greater range of behaviour change techniques improves weight outcomes for both parents and children. The development of future interventions and assessment of factors influencing effectiveness may be improved by paying careful attention to which family members are targeted and how they are involved in the intervention in terms of setting goals for behaviour change, providing support and training in behaviour change techniques.",A systematic review of family-spouse involvement in weight control and weight loss found that involving spouses tended to improve the effectiveness of weight control.
"Does heat or cold work better for acute muscle strain
Cochrane systematic review. To assess the effects of superficial heat and cold therapy for low back pain in adults. Heat and cold are commonly used in the treatment of low back pain. We searched electronic databases from inception to October 2005. Two authors independently assessed inclusion, methodologic quality, and extracted data, using the criteria recommended by the Cochrane Back Review Group. Nine trials involving 1,117 participants were included. In two trials of 258 participants with a mix of acute and subacute low back pain, heat wrap therapy significantly reduced pain after 5 days (weighted mean difference [WMD], 1.06; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.68-1.45, scale range, 0-5) compared with oral placebo. One trial of 90 participants with acute low back pain found that a heated blanket significantly decreased pain immediately after application (WMD, -32.20; 95% CI, -38.69 to -25.71; scale range, 0-100). One trial of 100 participants with a mix of acute and subacute low back pain examined the additional effects of adding exercise to heat wrap and found that it reduced pain after 7 days. The evidence base to support the common practice of superficial heat and cold for low back pain is limited, and there is a need for future higher-quality randomized controlled trials. There is moderate evidence in a small number of trials that heat wrap therapy provides a small short-term reduction in pain and disability in a population with a mix of acute and subacute low back pain, and that the addition of exercise further reduces pain and improves function. There is insufficient evidence to evaluate the effects of cold for low back pain and conflicting evidence for any differences between heat and cold for low back pain.","A 2006 Cochrane review that addressed treatment of lower back muscular strain, not soft-tissue injuries in general, found moderate evidence that heat therapy reduces pain by 17% and disability in the acute setting (P=.001). The review also cited 2 head-to-head trials that compared heat and cryotherapy; however, the study designs were poor and the results were contradictory."
"How should we follow up a positive screen for anemia in a 1-year old
The goal of detecting iron deficiency in children is to identify those whose Hb concentration will rise in response to treatment with iron. In a controlled treatment trial conducted among Eskimo children, we examined the effectiveness of various measures of iron nutrition in predicting a response to iron therapy (greater than 1.0 g/dl rise in Hb). A response was seen in 43%, and an additional 26% had an intermediate response (0.5 to 1.0 g/dl rise). When individual Hb values were expressed as SD scores of the Hb distribution of a reference population, a marked skew toward low scores was seen before treatment. After treatment, the distribution became more Gaussian, indicating that iron deficiency had been the major cause of anemia. Serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, and free erythrocyte protoporphyrin levels moved toward normal with treatment, however, none of the tests used was very effective in distinguishing individuals who would have a response t Hb from those who would not (sensitivities: 63 to 42%, specificities: 45 to 61%). Laboratory measures of iron nutrition were far more helpful in depicting the iron status of the population than they were in distinguishing iron-responsive from nonresponsive individuals.",Similar results were found in a prospective controlled treatment trial among Alaskan Native children.
"When is neuroimaging warranted for headache
Headache is a very common patient complaint but secondary causes for headache are unusual. Neuroimaging is both expensive and has a low yield in this group. Most patients with intracranial pathology have clinical features that would raise a ""red flag"". Appropriate selection of patients with headache for neuroimaging to look for secondary causes is very important. Red flags act as screening tools to help in identifying those patients presenting with headache who would benefit from prompt neuroimaging, and may increase the yield. The aim of this study is to evaluate clinical features in patients with headache using neuroimaging as a screening tool for intracranial pathology. 20 red flags were defined. A retrospective study of 111 patients was performed and the outcomes were divided into positive and negative. Abnormal neuroimaging was present in 39 patients. Results were analysed using the Logistic Regression model. Sensitivity and specificity of red flags were analysed to establish the cut-off point to predict abnormal neuroimaging and a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve plotted to show the sensitivity of the diagnostic test. Three red flag features proved to be statistically significant with the p-value of less than 0.05 on both univariate and multivariate analysis. These were: paralysis; papilloedema; and ""drowsiness, confusion, memory impairment and loss of consciousness"". In addition, if three or more red flags from the list were present, this showed strong indication of abnormal neuroimaging, from cut-off point of ROC curve (area under the curve =0.76).","A retrospective study reviewed records of 111 patients seen in an emergency department with headache and who had undergone neuroimaging (CT or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]). Three symptoms predicted a lesion: decreased level of consciousness (sensitivity=23%; positive likelihood ratio [LR+]=3.8), paralysis (sensitivity=25%; LR+=3.5), and papilledema (numbers not reported). In this study, 35% (39/111) of those receiving neuroimaging had intracranial pathology."
"What is the best test to detect herpes in skin lesions
These guidelines for the treatment of patients who have sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) were developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) after consultation with a group of professionals knowledgeable in the field of STDs who met in Atlanta on September 26-28, 2000. The information in this report updates the 1998 Guidelines for Treatment of Sexually Transmitted Diseases (MMWR 1998;47 [No. RR-1]). Included in these updated guidelines are new alternative regimens for scabies, bacterial vaginosis, early syphilis, and granuloma inguinale; an expanded section on the diagnosis of genital herpes (including type-specific serologic tests); new recommendations for treatment of recurrent genital herpes among persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); a revised approach to the management of victims of sexual assault; expanded regimens for the treatment of urethral meatal warts; and inclusion of hepatitis C as a sexually transmitted infection. In addition, these guidelines emphasize education and counseling for persons infected with human papillomavirus, clarify the diagnostic evaluation of congenital syphilis, and present information regarding the emergence of quinolone-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae and implications for treatment. Recommendations also are provided for vaccine-preventable STDs, including hepatitis A and hepatitis B.",Clinical suspicion needs to be confirmed by laboratory testing because it has a direct impact on counseling and prognosis.
"What are effective medication combinations for dyslipidemia
Colesevelam hydrochloride is a novel, potent, non-absorbed lipid-lowering agent previously shown to reduce low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. To examine the efficacy and safety of coadministration of colesevelam and atorvastatin, administration of these agents alone or in combination was examined in a double-blind study of 94 hypercholesterolemic men and women (baseline LDL cholesterol > or =160 mg/dl). After 4 weeks on the American Heart Association Step I diet, patients were randomized among five groups: placebo; colesevelam 3.8 g/day; atorvastatin 10 mg/day; coadminstered colesevelam 3.8 g/day plus atorvastatin 10 mg/day; or atorvastatin 80 mg/day. Fasting lipids were measured at screening, baseline and 2 and 4 weeks of treatment. LDL cholesterol decreased by 12-53% in all active treatment groups (P<0.01). LDL cholesterol reductions with combination therapy (48%) were statistically superior to colesevelam (12%) or low-dose atorvastatin (38%) alone (P<0.01), but similar to those achieved with atorvastatin 80 mg/day (53%). Total cholesterol decreased 6-39% in all active treatment groups (P<0.05). High density lipoprotein cholesterol increased significantly for all groups including placebo (P<0.05). Triglycerides decreased in patients taking atorvastatin alone (P<0.05), but were unaffected by colesevelam alone or in combination. The frequency of side effects did not differ among groups. At recommended starting doses of each agent, coadministration of colesevelam and atorvastatin was well tolerated, efficacious and produced additive LDL cholesterol reductions comparable to those observed with the maximum atorvastatin dose.",A randomized placebo-controlled trial demonstrated that combination therapy with colesevelam has similar effects. The absolute low density lipoprotein cholesterol reduction of with atorvastatin (Lipitor) alone (10 mg daily) increased from 38% to 48% after adding colesevelam 3.8 g daily (10% absolute low density lipoprotein cholesterol reduction).
"Are there big differences among beta-blockers in treating essential hypertension
Beta blockers have been used widely in the treatment of hypertension and are recommended as first-line drugs in hypertension guidelines. However, a preliminary analysis has shown that atenolol is not very effective in hypertension. We aim to substantially enlarge the data on atenolol and analyse the effect of different beta blockers. The Cochrane Library and PubMed were searched for beta blocker treatment in patients with primary hypertension. Data were then entered into the Cochrane Collaboration Review Manager package and were summarised in meta-analyses. 13 randomised controlled trials (n=105 951) were included in a meta-analysis comparing treatment with beta blockers with other antihypertensive drugs. Seven studies (n=27 433) were included in a comparison of beta blockers and placebo or no treatment. The relative risk of stroke was 16% higher for beta blockers (95% CI 4-30%) than for other drugs. There was no difference for myocardial infarction. When the effect of beta blockers was compared with that of placebo or no treatment, the relative risk of stroke was reduced by 19% for all beta blockers (7-29%), about half that expected from previous hypertension trials. There was no difference for myocardial infarction or mortality. In comparison with other antihypertensive drugs, the effect of beta blockers is less than optimum, with a raised risk of stroke. Hence, we believe that beta blockers should not remain first choice in the treatment of primary hypertension and should not be used as reference drugs in future randomised controlled trials of hypertension.","A meta-analysis covered 13 randomized controlled trials (n=105,951) comparing treatment with beta-blockers with other antihypertensive drugs.

"What is the best approach to a solitary pulmonary nodule identified by chest x-ray
Focal pulmonary lesions are commonly encountered in clinical practice, and positron emission tomography (PET) with the glucose analog 18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) may be an accurate test for identifying malignant lesions. To estimate the diagnostic accuracy of FDG-PET for malignant focal pulmonary lesions. Studies published between January 1966 and September 2000 in the MEDLINE and CANCERLIT databases; reference lists of identified studies; abstracts from recent conference proceedings; and direct contact with investigators. Studies that examined FDG-PET or FDG with a modified gamma camera in coincidence mode for diagnosis of focal pulmonary lesions; enrolled at least 10 participants with pulmonary nodules or masses, including at least 5 participants with malignant lesions; and presented sufficient data to permit calculation of sensitivity and specificity were included in the analysis. Two reviewers independently assessed study quality and abstracted data regarding prevalence of malignancy and sensitivity and specificity of the imaging test. Disagreements were resolved by discussion. We used a meta-analytic method to construct summary receiver operating characteristic curves. Forty studies met inclusion criteria. Study methodological quality was fair. Sample sizes were small and blinding was often incomplete. For 1474 focal pulmonary lesions of any size, the maximum joint sensitivity and specificity (the upper left point on the receiver operating characteristic curve at which sensitivity and specificity are equal) of FDG-PET was 91.2% (95% confidence interval, 89.1%-92.9%). In current practice, FDG-PET operates at a point on the summary receiver operating characteristic curve that corresponds approximately to a sensitivity and specificity of 96.8% and 77.8%, respectively. There was no difference in diagnostic accuracy for pulmonary nodules compared with lesions of any size (P =.43), for semiquantitative methods of image interpretation compared with qualitative methods (P =.52), or for FDG-PET compared with FDG imaging with a modified gamma camera in coincidence mode (P =.19). Positron emission tomography with 18-fluorodeoxyglucose is an accurate noninvasive imaging test for diagnosis of pulmonary nodules and larger mass lesions, although few data exist for nodules smaller than 1 cm in diameter. In current practice, FDG-PET has high sensitivity and intermediate specificity for malignancy.","A meta-analysis of 40 studies of FDG PET scanning for solitary pulmonary nodules yielded a maximum joint sensitivity and specificity of 90% (95% CI, 86.4%- 92.7%). The methodological quality of studies included in the meta-analysis was fair, with small sample sizes (inclusion criteria were for a minimum of 10 patients with pulmonary nodules and malignant prevalence of at least 0.5); masking was frequently incomplete."
"How should we manage a patient with a positive PPD and prior BCG vaccination
Household contacts <15 years of age of adults with tuberculosis (TB) attending a reference center in Aracaju, Sergipe, Northeast Brazil. To assess the use of purified protein derivative (PPD) and frequency of infection in children with high Calmette-GuÃ©rin bacillus (BCG) coverage who were recently exposed to TB. Cross-sectional study of 141 exposed household contacts <15 years of age and 506 nonexposed neighborhood controls. Children were examined and assessed for degree of exposure to index cases, BCG vaccination and scar and were tested with PPD. Exposed children were younger and less up to date in their vaccination schedule than controls (P < 0.05). BCG had been given to 95.6% of exposed children and 97.4% of controls, but only 80.9% of exposed vs. 88.5% of controls had a scar (P < 0.05). Scar sizes of exposed children were smaller (medians, 4.5 and 7 mm, respectively; P < 0.05). Children had lower weight for age z scores and height than the National Center for Health Statistics standards. Exposed children had lower weight for age z scores than controls (P < 0.05). Sixty-seven (47.5%) exposed children and 18 (3.6%) controls had PPD readings of >10 mm. Positivity and induration sizes increased with age, although this was significant only in the controls. The presence of a BCG scar was not associated with having a positive PPD. The degree of exposure was an important factor for PPD positivity; 66 (60.6%) of the 109 children with close exposure were positive compared with 1 (3.1%) of 32 with less intimate exposure. PPD indurations among close contacts were also larger than those with restricted exposure and controls (16.3, 11 and 9.4 mm, respectively; P < 0.05). PPD positivity was associated with the quantification of acid-fast bacilli in the adult; 38.5% of contacts with adults with sputum with (+) were positive, compared with 42.3% of those with (++) and 58.4% with (+++) (P < 0.05). PPD is a useful test to identify children infected with TB independently of whether they had received BCG or not. Children exposed to adults with TB are at high risk of infection. The risk of infection is associated with the intimacy of contact and the number of bacilli expectorated in sputum.","A Brazilian case-control study found that reactions by those BCG recipients later exposed to tuberculosis were significantly greater than those with no tuberculosis exposure.3 The study noted that 47.5% of exposed children (defined as those with a household contact) had PPD readings of >10 mm, compared with just 3.6% of control children."
"Do antibiotics prevent recurrent urinary tract infection in children with anatomic abnormalities
To assess the benefits and harms of antimicrobial prophylaxis to prevent urinary tract infections (UTIs) in persons with neurogenic bladders caused by spinal cord dysfunction. A broad search strategy with no language restriction was conducted of MEDLINE (1966-January 1998), EMBASE (1974-January 1998), and CINAHL (1982-July 1998) using the general search terms urinary tract, urinary tract infections, bacteriuria, paraplegia, quadriplegia, spinal cord injuries, multiple sclerosis, neurogenic bladder, and neuropathic bladder. Additional articles were identified by experts and by reviewing reference lists of articles obtained from searches. Criteria included human studies of adults and adolescents who had neurogenic bladder due to spinal cord dysfunction; the studies had to address antimicrobial prophylaxis of UTI and include bacteriuria or UTI as an outcome. We excluded any study that was clearly not a controlled trial or that only included children under the age of 13 years. Two reviewers independently abstracted data, and disagreements were resolved by consensus. Two reviewers independently abstracted data, and disagreements were resolved by consensus. Studies were graded by 1 project investigator according to quality criteria developed by Jadad and Schulz. The sizes of the effect of antimicrobial prophylaxis on weekly infection rates from 15 trials that met the inclusion criteria were pooled by using a random effects model. Antimicrobial prophylaxis did not significantly decrease symptomatic infections. Prophylaxis was associated with a reduction in asymptomatic bacteriuria among acute patients (<90d after spinal cord injury; P <.05); 1 patient would require 3.7 weeks of treatment on average to prevent 1 asymptomatic infection. For nonacute patients, the reduction approached statistical significance (P =.06). Prophylaxis resulted in an approximately twofold increase in antimicrobial-resistant bacteria. The regular use of antimicrobial prophylaxis for most patients who have neurogenic bladder caused by spinal cord dysfunction is not supported. A clinically important effect, however, has not been excluded. Future research should focus on randomized trials in those patients who have recurrent UTIs that limit their daily functioning and well-being.","A meta-analysis of 15 controlled clinical trials in children with neurogenic bladder due to spinal cord dysfunction. This analysis showed that antibiotic prophylaxis was associated with a reduction in asymptomatic bacteruria among children with acute spinal cord injury (P<.05), but there was no significant reduction in symptomatic infections. Prophylaxis resulted in an approximately twofold increase in antimicrobial-resistant bacteria. The researchers concluded that although a clinically important effect has not been excluded, the regular use of antimicrobial prophylaxis for most patients who have neurogenic bladder caused by spinal cord dysfunction is not supported at this time."
"Are ARBs or angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors preferred for nephropathy in diabetes
Microalbuminuria and hypertension are risk factors for diabetic nephropathy. Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system slows the progression to diabetic nephropathy in patients with type 1 diabetes, but similar data are lacking for hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes. We evaluated the renoprotective effect of the angiotensin-II-receptor antagonist irbesartan in hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria. A total of 590 hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria were enrolled in this multinational, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of irbesartan, at a dose of either 150 mg daily or 300 mg daily, and were followed for two years. The primary outcome was the time to the onset of diabetic nephropathy, defined by persistent albuminuria in overnight specimens, with a urinary albumin excretion rate that was greater than 200 microg per minute and at least 30 percent higher than the base-line level. The base-line characteristics in the three groups were similar. Ten of the 194 patients in the 300-mg group (5.2 percent) and 19 of the 195 patients in the 150-mg group (9.7 percent) reached the primary end point, as compared with 30 of the 201 patients in the placebo group (14.9 percent) (hazard ratios, 0.30 [95 percent confidence interval, 0.14 to 0.61; P< 0.001] and 0.61 [95 percent confidence interval, 0.34 to 1.08; P=0.081 for the two irbesartan groups, respectively). The average blood pressure during the course of the study was 144/83 mm Hg in the placebo group, 143/83 mm Hg in the 150-mg group, and 141/83 mm Hg in the 300-mg group (P=0.004 for the comparison of systolic blood pressure between the placebo group and the combined irbesartan groups). Serious adverse events were less frequent among the patients treated with irbesartan (P=0.02). Irbesartan is renoprotective independently of its blood-pressure-lowering effect in patients with type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria.","The 2-year IRMA Irbesartan Microalbuminuria study, a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, randomized 590 patients with type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and persistent microalbuminuria to receive 150 or 300 mg of irbesartan Avapro or placebo. Additional antihypertensive agents were allowed in each arm with the exception of angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, ARBs, and dihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers. The primary outcome was the development of overt nephropathy defined by a urinary albumin excretion rate >200 Âµg/min that is at least 30% higher than the baseline rate. This trial showed that irbesartan delayed progression to nephropathy independent of its effect on blood pressure compared with conventional therapy NNT=16 at the 150-mg dose and NNT=11 at the 300-mg dose."
"Does combining aspirin and warfarin decrease the risk of stroke for patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation
Atrial fibrillation is associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke. Data on individual patients were pooled from five recently completed randomized trials comparing warfarin (all studies) or aspirin (the Atrial Fibrillation, Aspirin, Anticoagulation Study and the Stroke Prevention in Atrial Fibrillation Study) with control in patients with atrial fibrillation. The purpose of the analysis was to (1) identify patient features predictive of a high or low risk of stroke, (2) assess the efficacy of antithrombotic therapy in major patient subgroups (eg, women), and (3) obtain the most precise estimate of the efficacy and risks of antithrombotic therapy in atrial fibrillation. For the warfarin-control comparison there were 1889 patient-years receiving warfarin and 1802 in the control group. For the aspirin-placebo comparison there were 1132 patient-years receiving aspirin and 1133 receiving placebo. The daily dose of aspirin was 75 mg in the Atrial Fibrillation, Aspirin, Anticoagulation Study and 325 mg in the Stroke Prevention in Atrial Fibrillation Study. To monitor warfarin dosage, three studies used prothrombin time ratios and two used international normalized ratios. The lowest target intensity was a prothrombin time ratio of 1.2 to 1.5 and the highest target intensity was an international normalized ratio of 2.8 to 4.2. The primary end points were ischemic stroke and major hemorrhage, as assessed by each study. At the time of randomization the mean age was 69 years and the mean blood pressure was 142/82 mm Hg. Forty-six percent of the patients had a history of hypertension, 6% had a previous transient ischemic attack or stroke, and 14% had diabetes. Risk factors that predicted stroke on multivariate analyses in control patients were increasing age, history of hypertension, previous transient ischemic attack or stroke, and diabetes. Patients younger than 65 years who had none of the other predictive factors (15% of all patients) had an annual rate of stroke of 1.0%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.3% to 3.0%. The annual rate of stroke was 4.5% for the control group and 1.4% for the warfarin group (risk reduction, 68%; 95% CI, 50% to 79%). The efficacy of warfarin was consistent across all studies and subgroups of patients. In women, warfarin decreased the risk of stroke by 84% (95% CI, 55% to 95%) compared with 60% (95% CI, 35% to 76%) in men. The efficacy of aspirin was not as consistent. The risk reduction with 75 mg of aspirin in the Atrial Fibrillation, Aspirin, Anticoagulation Study was 18% (95% CI, 60% to 58%), and with 325 mg of aspirin in the Stroke Prevention in Atrial Fibrillation Study the risk reduction was 44% (95% CI, 7% to 66%). When both studies were combined the risk reduction was 36% (95% CI, 4% to 57%). The annual rate of major hemorrhage (intracranial bleeding or a bleed requiring hospitalization or 2 units of blood) was 1.0% for the control group, 1.0% for the aspirin group, and 1.3% for the warfarin group. In these five randomized trials warfarin consistently decreased the risk of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation (a 68% reduction in risk) with virtually no increase in the frequency of major bleeding. Patients with atrial fibrillation younger than 65 years without a history of hypertension, previous stroke or transient ischemic attack, or diabetes were at very low risk of stroke even when not treated. The efficacy of aspirin was less consistent. Further studies are needed to clarify the role of aspirin in atrial fibrillation.",Pooled analysis with more than 2900 patients revealed an annual stroke risk of 4.5% for control patients and 1.4% for patients receiving adjusted-dose warfarin (number needed to treat [NNT] for 1 year=32).
"Do topical antibiotics improve wound healing
To evaluate the ability of a novel topical antimicrobial gel containing cetrimide, bacitracin, and polymyxin B sulfate to prevent infections of minor wounds. A clinical trial compared the test preparation with placebo and a povidone iodine antiseptic cream. Five primary schools in Sydney, Australia, participated in the study over a 6-week spring/summer school term. Children aged 5-12 years with parental consent were eligible for study participation. Accidental injuries occurring at school were treated in a standardized manner by nurses at each site. Wounds were evaluated by the medical practitioner after 3 days of topical treatment. The clinical outcome was classified as resolution or suspected infection. If a clinical infection was suspected, the injury was swabbed for microbiologic evaluation. Growth of a dominant microorganism was classified as a microbiologic infection. Of the 177 injuries treated, there were nine clinical infections. A comparison of these showed a significant difference among treatment groups (p < 0.05). This difference was associated with the test preparation and placebo; the test preparation reduced the incidence of clinical infection from 12.5% to 1.6% (p < 0.05; 95% CI, 0.011 to 0.207). A comparison of microbiologic infections showed no significant differences among treatment groups (p > 0.05). The novel gel preparation containing cetrimide, bacitracin, and polymyxin B sulfate showed therapeutic action and reduced the incidence of clinical infections in minor accidental wounds. It may be a suitable product for first aid prophylaxis.","A clinical trial compared the efficacy of a cetrimide, bacitracin zinc, and polymyxin B sulfate gel (a combination not available in the US) with placebo and povidone-iodine cream in preventing infections in 177 minor wounds (cuts, grazes, scrapes, and scratches) among children. The antibiotic gel was found to be superior to placebo and equivalent to povidone-iodine, in that it reduced clinical infections from 12.5% to 1.6% (absolute risk reduction [ARR]=0.109; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.011-0.207; NNT=11)."
"Does routine amniotomy have a role in normal labor
Intentional artificial rupture of the amniotic membranes during labour, sometimes called amniotomy or 'breaking of the waters', is one of the most commonly performed procedures in modern obstetric and midwifery practice. The primary aim of amniotomy is to speed up contractions and, therefore, shorten the length of labour. However, there are concerns regarding unintended adverse effects on the woman and baby. To determine the effectiveness and safety of amniotomy alone for (1) routinely shortening all labours that start spontaneously, and (2) shortening labours that have started spontaneously, but have become prolonged. We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 March 2007). Randomised controlled trials comparing amniotomy alone versus intention to preserve the membranes. We excluded quasi-randomised trials. Two authors assessed identified studies for inclusion. Both authors extracted data. Primary analysis was by intention to treat. We have included 14 studies in this review, involving 4893 women. There was no evidence of any statistical difference in length of first stage of labour (weighted mean difference -20.43 minutes, 95% confidence interval (CI) -95.93 to 55.06), maternal satisfaction with childbirth experience (standardised mean difference 0.27, 95% CI -0.49 to 1.04) or low Apgar score less than seven at five minutes (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.05). Amniotomy was associated with an increased risk of delivery by caesarean section compared to women in the control group, although the difference was not statistically significant (RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.62). There was no consistency between papers regarding the timing of amniotomy during labour in terms of cervical dilatation. On the basis of the findings of this review, we cannot recommend that amniotomy should be introduced routinely as part of standard labour management and care. We do recommend that the evidence presented in this review should be made available to women offered an amniotomy and may be useful as a foundation for discussion and any resulting decisions made between women and their caregivers.","A Cochrane review of 14 trials (4893 women) investigated the risks and benefits of routine amniotomy vs intention to leave membranes intact. All trials included only very-low-risk women in spontaneous labor at term with a singleton fetus in vertex presentation. Nine trials (4370 women) included in the Cochrane review reported cesarean section rates. Women in the amniotomy group had an increased risk of cesarean delivery compared with the control group, but the difference did not reach statistical significance (relative risk=1.26; 95% CI, 0.98-1.62). Because cesarean section was surprisingly rare in this low-risk patient population compared with the national average, the studies were not powered to show statistical significance in this secondary outcome."
"How do you evaluate macrocytosis without anemia
Elevation of mean cell volume (MCV) is a common clinical problem, but the etiologic spectrum and optimal diagnostic evaluation of macrocytosis are not well defined. We studied 300 consecutive hospitalized adult patients with MCV values > or = 100 fL. Assessment included complete blood counts, morphologic review, liver function tests, and levels of serum cobalamin (Cbl), methylmalonic acid, and total homocysteine. The most common cause of macrocytosis was drug therapy, followed by alcohol, liver disease, and reticulocytosis. Megaloblastic hematopoiesis accounted for less than 10% of cases. MCV values > 120 fL were usually caused by Cbl deficiency. Anisocytosis, macro-ovalocytosis, and teardrop erythrocytes were most prominent in megaloblastic hematopoiesis. Elevated levels of serum methylmalonic acid and total homocysteine were useful in the diagnosis of Cbl deficiency. Drugs and alcohol are the most common causes of macrocytosis in hospitalized patients in a New York City teaching hospital. We have formulated tentative guidelines for the evaluation of high MCV values in this setting.",A prospective study of 300 hospitalized patients with macrocytosis found that 100% of marrow disorders and hemolysis that caused macrocytosis also caused an associated anemia.
"What is the most effective beta-blocker for heart failure
The survival benefit of beta-blocker treatment in patients with heart failure has been established in recent trials. Yet, the impact of beta-blockers added on high dose angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors has not been reported. To investigate the effect of atenolol, a hydrophilic, selective beta1-adrenergic antagonist, added on enalapril 40 mg/day in patients with advanced left ventricular dysfunction in a double-blind placebo-controlled trial. One hundred and nineteen patients with class II or III heart failure, left ventricular ejection fraction < or = 25% and treatment with 40 mg enalapril daily were given an initial challenge dose of atenolol 12. 5 mg. One hundred patients (54 with idiopathic, 28 with ischemic, 18 with other dilated cardiomyopathy) tolerated challenge and were randomized to atenolol (maintenance dose 89+/-11 mg/day, range 50-100 mg/day) or placebo. The primary endpoint was combined worsening heart failure or death within 2 years, the secondary endpoint was hospitalization for cardiac events. After 395+/-266 days interim analysis revealed a significant difference between the atenolol and placebo group (log rank P<0.01) and the trial was concluded. Twenty-seven patients had developed worsening heart failure (8 in the atenolol group vs. 19 in the placebo group) and 13 patients had died (5 in the atenolol vs. 8 in the placebo group). Overall there were 23 hospitalizations for cardiac events (6 in the atenolol group vs. 21 in the placebo group, P=0.07); 17 hospitalizations were due to worsening heart failure (5 in the atenolol group, 12 in the placebo-group, P=0.05) and 10 due to arrhythmias (1 in the atenolol group vs. 9 in the placebo group, P<0.01) The data suggest that in patients with advanced left ventricular dysfunction, beta-blockers can provide substantial benefits supplementary to that already achieved with high dose enalapril treatment.",A study of atenolol versus placebo in subjects with ejection fraction â‰¤25% from various causes (N=100) was halted early when atenolol produced a 50% reduction in worsening heart failure and a 71% reduction in cardiac hospitalizations. A trend toward improved survival was noted but did not reach statistical significance.
"Which treatments work best for hemorrhoids
This study was performed according to a prospective, randomized, open design. The aim was to test the efficacy of local application of nifedipine ointment in healing acute thrombosed external hemorrhoids. Ninety-eight patients who gave their informed consent were recruited; they received clinical examination and anoscopy. A questionnaire to evaluate symptoms, pain, and concurrent use of analgesics was administered. Patients treated with nifedipine (n = 50) used topical 0.3 percent nifedipine and 1.5 percent lidocaine ointment every 12 hours for two weeks. The control group, consisting of 48 patients, received topical 1.5 percent lidocaine ointment during therapy. Results obtained were as follows: complete relief of pain in 43 patients (86 percent) of the nifedipine-treated group as opposed to 24 patients (50 percent) of the control group after 7 days of therapy (P < 0.01); oral analgesics were used by 4 patients (8 percent) in the nifedipine-treated group as opposed to 26 patients (54.1 percent) of the control group after 7 days of therapy (P < 0.01); and resolution of acute thrombosed external hemorrhoids was achieved after 14 days of therapy in 46 patients (92 percent) of the nifedipine-treated group, as opposed to 22 patients (45.8 percent) of the control group (P < 0.01). We did not observe any systemic side effect in patients treated with nifedipine. Our study clearly demonstrates that the use of topical nifedipine, which at present is for treatment of cardiovascular disorders, is a reliable new option in the conservative treatment of thrombosed external hemorrhoids.","A prospective, randomized controlled trial (RCT) of 98 patients treated nonsurgically found improved pain relief with a combination of topical nifedipine 0.3% and lidocaine 1.5% compared with lidocaine alone. The number needed to treat for complete pain relief at 7 days was 3."
"What steps can reduce morbidity and mortality caused by hip fractures
To study the effectiveness of haloperidol prophylaxis on incidence, severity, and duration of postoperative delirium in elderly hip-surgery patients at risk for delirium. Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Large medical school-affiliated general hospital in Alkmaar, The Netherlands. A total of 430 hip-surgery patients aged 70 and older at risk for postoperative delirium. Haloperidol 1.5 mg/d or placebo was started preoperatively and continued for up to 3 days postoperatively. Proactive geriatric consultation was provided for all randomized patients. The primary outcome was the incidence of postoperative delirium (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, and Confusion Assessment Method criteria). Secondary outcomes were the severity of delirium (Delirium Rating Scale, revised version-98 (DRS-R-98)), the duration of delirium, and the length of hospital stay. The overall incidence of postoperative delirium was 15.8%. The percentage of patients with postoperative delirium in the haloperidol and placebo treatment condition was 15.1% and 16.5%, respectively (relative risk=0.91, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.6-1.3); the mean highest DRS-R-98 score+/-standard deviation was 14.4+/-3.4 and 18.4+/-4.3, respectively (mean difference 4.0, 95% CI=2.0-5.8; P<.001); delirium duration was 5.4 versus 11.8 days, respectively (mean difference 6.4 days, 95% CI=4.0-8.0; P<.001); and the mean number of days in the hospital was 17.1+/-11.1 and 22.6+/-16.7, respectively (mean difference 5.5 days, 95% CI=1.4-2.3; P<.001). No haloperidol-related side effects were noted. Low-dose haloperidol prophylactic treatment demonstrated no efficacy in reducing the incidence of postoperative delirium. It did have a positive effect on the severity and duration of delirium. Moreover, haloperidol reduced the number of days patients stayed in the hospital, and the therapy was well tolerated.",One study showed that prophylaxis with haloperidol for hip fracture patients did not decrease the incidence of postoperative delirium but did reduce its duration and severity.
"Do any folk remedies or herbals help induce labor
There is a lack of basic knowledge on the part of both clinicians and patients as to the indications for use and safety of herbal medicines in pregnancy and lactation. This is one article in a series that systematically reviews the evidence for commonly used herbs during pregnancy and lactation. To systematically review the literature for evidence on the use, safety, and pharmacology of black cohosh focusing on issues pertaining to pregnancy and lactation. We searched 7 electronic databases and compiled data according to the grade of evidence found. Black cohosh, alone or in combination with other medicinal herbs as ""mother's cordial"", has a long traditional use and is frequently used by midwives as a uterine stimulant and labour-inducing aid. Low-level evidence based on theory and expert opinion shows the following concerns with respect to black cohosh use during pregnancy: 1) labour-inducing effects, 2) hormonal effects, 3) emmenagogue properties and, 4) anovulatory effects. During lactation, there is low-level evidence from theoretical and expert opinion of black cohosh having hormonal properties. Black cohosh should be used with caution during pregnancy, particularly during the first trimester where its purported labour-inducing effects could be of concern, and during lactation. Black cohosh should undergo rigorous high quality human studies to determine its safety in pregnancy and lactation.",A systematic review of the literature on black cohosh in pregnancy found no trials that evaluated its efficacy for inducing labor. The article described black cohosh as potentially unsafe because of the lack of trials demonstrating safety and possible deleterious estrogenic effects.
"Should we screen for bacterial vaginosis in those at risk for preterm labor
Bacterial vaginosis has been associated with preterm birth. In clinical trials, the treatment of bacterial vaginosis in pregnant women who previously had a preterm delivery reduced the risk of recurrence. To determine whether treating women in a general obstetrical population who have asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis (as diagnosed on the basis of vaginal Gram's staining and pH) prevents preterm delivery, we randomly assigned 1953 women who were 16 to less than 24 weeks pregnant to receive two 2-g doses of metronidazole or placebo. The diagnostic studies were repeated and a second treatment was administered to all the women at 24 to less than 30 weeks' gestation. The primary outcome was the rate of delivery before 37 weeks' gestation. Bacterial vaginosis resolved in 657 of 845 women who had follow-up Gram's staining in the metronidazole group (77.8 percent) and 321 of 859 women in the placebo group (37.4 percent). Data on the time and characteristics of delivery were available for 953 women in the metronidazole group and 966 in the placebo group. Preterm delivery occurred in 116 women in the metronidazole group (12.2 percent) and 121 women in the placebo group (12.5 percent) (relative risk, 1.0; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.8 to 1.2). Treatment did not prevent preterm deliveries that resulted from spontaneous labor (5.1 percent in the metronidazole group vs. 5.7 percent in the placebo group) or spontaneous rupture of the membranes (4.2 percent vs. 3.7 percent), nor did it prevent delivery before 32 weeks (2.3 percent vs. 2.7 percent). Treatment with metronidazole did not reduce the occurrence of preterm labor, intraamniotic or postpartum infections, neonatal sepsis, or admission of the infant to the neonatal intensive care unit. The treatment of asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis in pregnant women does not reduce the occurrence of preterm delivery or other adverse perinatal outcomes.","A large study in 2000 that looked at the use of metronidazole in the treatment of asymptomatic women for bacterial vaginosis did not demonstrate any reduction in preterm birth. In this study, 21,965 asymptomatic women between 8 and 22 weeks gestation were screened for bacterial vaginosis with Gram stain using Nugent's criteria. Then, 1953 women with bacterial vaginosis were randomized to receive either 1 g of metronidazole orally for 2 days or placebo. Between 24 and 29 weeks, all of the women were then rescreened for bacterial vaginosis by Gram stain. Even if the results were negative, women received another course of the metronidazole or placebo. In this study, preterm delivery rates did not improve for either low- or high-risk women. Specifically, a subgroup analysis of 213 women with previous preterm delivery did not show any benefit to treatment with metronidazole."
"What hormonal contraception is most effective for obese wome
This report looks at data from 17 032 women who took part in the Oxford Family Planning Association contraceptive study. Thirty-eight first accidental pregnancies occurred during 6779 woman-years of use of progestogen-only oral contraceptives (0.56 per 100) and 95 first accidental pregnancies occurred during 48 692 woman-years of combined oral contraceptive use (0.20 per 100). Although associations with age and parity were found, there was no evidence of any influence of body weight on the risk of accidental pregnancy with either form of oral contraceptive.","A large cohort study did not find any association between failure of the oral contraceptive pill or progestin-only pill and obesity; however, the total number of pregnancies among obese women was too small to achieve statistical significance."
"Does early detection of suspected atherosclerotic renovascular hypertension change outcomes
Renal artery stenosis (RAS) may cause hypertension, azotemia, episodes of flash pulmonary edema and congestive heart failure. Renal artery angioplasty and stenting was performed in 207 patients from 1991 to 1997. Thirty-nine of these patients (19%) underwent renal artery stenting for the control of recurrent episodes of congestive heart failure and flash pulmonary edema. All patients had angiographic evidence of severe (>70%) bilateral RAS (n = 18) or severe RAS to a solitary functioning kidney (n = 21). Sixteen patients (41%) were male and 23 (59%) were female, mean age 69.9 years (range 50-85 years). Of the 18 patients with bilateral RAS, 12 (66.6%) underwent bilateral stenting. Mean blood pressure decreased from 174/85 +/- 32/23 mmHg to 148/72 +/- 24/14 mmHg (p < 0.001). Mean number of blood pressure medications decreased from 3 +/- 1 to 2.5 +/- 1 (p = 0.006). Twenty-eight patients (71.8%) had improvement in blood pressure control. The mean serum creatinine decreased from 3.16 +/- 1.61 to 2.65 +/- 1.87 (p = 0.06). Six of 39 patients (15.4%) used angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors prior to stenting whereas 19 of 39 patients (48.7%) used ACE inhibitors poststenting (p = 0.004). Twenty of 39 patients (51.4%) demonstrated improvement in serum creatinine, 10 of 39 patients (25.6%) had stabilization of serum creatinine and nine of 39 patients (23%) demonstrated worsening. The number of hospitalizations due to congestive heart failure in the year preceding renal artery stenting was 2.4 +/- 1.4 and poststenting was 0.3 +/- 0.7 (p < 0.001). The New York Heart Association Functional Class decreased from 2.9 +/- 0.9 prestenting to 1.6 +/- 0.9 poststenting (p < 0.001). Thirty of 39 patients (77%) had no hospitalizations for congestive heart failure during a mean follow-up period of 21.3 months. Nine patients expired during the course of follow up; eight of the nine patients died within the first year after renal artery stenting. Renal artery stenting decreased the frequency of congestive heart failure, flash pulmonary edema, and the need for hospitalization in most patients. Blood pressure was markedly improved in the majority of patients with improved or stabilized renal function. Evaluation for RAS is important in hypertensive patients who present with recurrent congestive heart failure or flash pulmonary edema.",Patients who have recurrent episodes of congestive heart failure or flash pulmonary edema with severe RAS have marked functional improvement following percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty with stenting. One retrospective cohort study (n=39) reported a decrease in hospitalizations (from 2.4 Â±1.4 per year to 0.3 Â±0.7 per year; P<.001) and improvement in New York Heart Association heart failure functional classification (2.9 Â±0.9 to 1.6 Â±0.9).
"Can you differentiate bacterial from viral pediatric infections based on the CBC
Occult bacteremia affects approximately 5% of febrile children ages 2 to 36 months. Many physicians empirically treat children who have a temperature higher than 39 degrees C, a white blood cell (WBC) count of more than 15.0 x 10(9)/L, and no focus of infection with antibiotics. We undertook this investigation to better define predictive indicators for bacteremia. Specifically we were concerned with determining whether the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is a better diagnostic indicator than the total WBC count and whether the manual differential (which includes a band cell count) is necessary or helpful. Three separate groups of patients aged 2 to 36 months were assessed retrospectively. Group A consisted of febrile children (temperature, > 39 degrees C) who had positive blood cultures (50 patients). Group B included febrile children (temperature, > 39 degrees C) who had negative blood cultures (59 patients). Group C, nonfebrile children admitted to the hospital was the control group (61 patients). The ANC and the total WBC count were significantly higher in group A than in group B. Although they were equally sensitive, the ANC was more specific than the total WBC count. Band cell counts of greater than 10% and the percentage of total neutrophils also were greater in group A than in group B. The values for group C were not significantly different from those for group B. Although a total WBC count of 15.0 x 10(9)/L is currently used to identify children at risk for occult bacteremia, the ANC seems to be as sensitive an indicator and may be more specific. Our study demonstrated that (1) the WBC count is a good indicator of occult bacteremia, (2) the ANC is as sensitive as the WBC count and may be more specific, (3) automated ANCs are comparable to manual ANCs, and (4) the band cell count is insensitive as an indicator and does not add any predictive value.","To improve the diagnostic utility of the CBC, some studies have examined individual components of the white blood cell differential count. In particular, the use of the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) has been proposed as a superior marker of serious bacterial infection."
"Which interventions are best for alleviating nipple pain in nursing mothers
To review the literature on nipple pain and to delineate effective strategies for the prevention and treatment of nipple pain in breastfeeding mothers. Computerized searches on MEDLINE, Pre-MEDLINE, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library. Articles from indexed journals relevant to the objective were reviewed from January 1983 to April 2004. Preference was given to research-based studies in English. Data were extracted and organized under two headings: prevention of nipple pain or trauma and treatment of nipple pain or trauma. The Critical Appraisal Form by J. Briggs was used to extract the data from research-based articles. The health benefits of breastfeeding for mother and infant are well documented; however, nipple pain is a common reason reported by women for the early termination of breastfeeding. Several studies have compared various treatments for either the prevention of or treatment for nipple pain. These treatments include warm water compresses, tea bag compresses, heat, application of expressed mother's milk, lanolin, vitamin A, collagenase, dexpanthenol, hydrogel therapy, glycerin gel therapy, moist occlusive dressing, education regarding proper latch-on and positioning, and no treatment. No one topical agent showed superior results in the relief of nipple discomfort. The most important factor in decreasing the incidence of nipple pain is the provision of education in relation to proper breastfeeding technique and latch-on as well as anticipatory guidance regarding the high incidence of early postpartum nipple pain.",The only topical agent found to have any detrimental effect was a glycerin-based hydrogel dressing that was associated with an increased incidence of breast infections.
"Which patients with suspected exposure to pertussis should receive prophylaxis
We assessed the quality of evidence for the use of erythromycin in preventing secondary transmission of pertussis to close contacts of primary cases. A literature search was undertaken and identified papers were reviewed critically. Thirteen original papers and 1 manuscript met the inclusion criteria for review (3 randomized controlled trials, 4 analytical studies and 7 descriptive studies). Evidence from both experimental and analytical studies showed little effect of the use of erythromycin in preventing secondary transmission. Its effect is at best modest when compared with the protection conferred by use of good quality whole cell vaccine. Three studies reported adverse events with erythromycin prophylaxis; these were mainly nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. In countries where effective pertussis vaccines are in use, erythromycin use should be confined to close contacts of cases, particularly unimmunized children or partially immunized infants who would be most susceptible to the complications of pertussis, or adults who come into close contact with vulnerable children.","Macrolides (erythromycin, clarithromycin, or azithromycin) are recommended for postexposure prophylaxis. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is a second-line agent. A short course of erythromycin (7 days), azithromycin (3-5 days), or clarithromycin (7 days) is as effective as a 2-week course of erythromycin in eradicating Bordetella pertussis from the nasopharynx."
"Are nasal steroid sprays effective for otitis media with effusion
Following otitis media, 10% to 50% of children develop residual middle ear effusion with concurrent hearing loss and potential cognitive, behavioral, and language impairment. Prophylactic antibiotics and tympanostomy tubes are currently recommended treatments for chronic middle ear effusion. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study of chronic middle ear effusion, we assessed the effectiveness of topical intranasal beclomethasone as an adjunct to prophylactic antibiotic therapy. Sixty-one children, aged 3 to 11 years with persistent middle ear effusion greater than 3 months, were randomized into three treatment groups: (1) prophylactic antibiotics; (2) prophylactic antibiotics plus intranasal beclomethasone (336 micrograms/day); and (3) prophylactic antibiotics plus intranasal placebo. Patients were evaluated with aeroallergen skin tests at entry; and tympanogram, otoscopic examination, and symptom questionnaire at 0, 4, 8, and 12 weeks. While middle ear pressures, otoscopic examinations, and symptom scores were improved for each treatment group over 12 weeks of therapy, the beclomethasone plus antibiotics group improved all three measures more rapidly than the antibiotics-alone and placebo nasal spray plus antibiotics groups over the first 8 weeks. Only the beclomethasone group significantly improved left (P = .004) and right (P = .01) middle ear pressures over 12 weeks. Resolution of chronic middle ear effusions was more frequent in the beclomethasone group (P < or = .05 at 4 and 8 weeks). No difference in response to nasal steroids was observed between atopic and nonatopic subjects. We conclude that intranasal beclomethasone may be a useful adjunct to prophylactic antibiotic treatment of chronic middle ear effusion.","The Tracy study enrolled children with chronic OME referred to a chronic ear clinic from October to June. Inclusion criteria included 3 episodes of acute otitis media in the prior 6 months or 4 episodes in the prior 12 months. This was a randomized comparison study with 3 treatment arms: an active nasal spray group and 2 control groups. The odds ratio for OME persisting after short-term follow-up was 0.79 (95% CI, 0.20-3.19); after intermediate follow-up the odds ratio was 0.72 (95% CI, 0.21-2.44). This study, which included a symptom score after 3 months, favored treatment, with a weighted mean difference of -4.5, but with wide 95% CI of -10.28 to 1.28. An effect was demonstrated on clearing effusions in the short term, but the advantage appeared to vanish for the most part by 3 months. The study did not evaluate improvements in hearing."
"What's the best drug treatment for premature ejaculation
To evaluate the efficacy and safety of sildenafil citrate in the treatment of premature ejaculation (PE) complicated by erectile dysfunction (ED). Forty-five patients of PE complicated by ED received flexible doses of sildenafil from 50 to 100 mg for 1 to 3 months. Intravaginal ejaculatory latency time (IELT) and sexual satisfaction ratio (SSR) of partner were recorded to evaluate the effect of PE treatment, as well as the general efficacy and satisfaction of ED treatment. And the difference of IIEF-5 before and after the treatment were compared. Twenty-seven patients had their PE improved and the effective rate was 60%. Forty patients reported the improvement in erection and the percentage of erectile improvement was 88.88%. All the 27 patients with improvement of PE achieved effective erection through the administration of 50 mg sildenafil and the satisfaction rate reached 81.48%. On the other hand, only 1 case (5.56%) reported satisfaction over the treatment in the 18 patients who did not obtain improvement of PE. Between the PE improvement group and non-improvement group, there were significant differences (P < 0.001) shown in IIEF-5 scores before and after the treatment. Mild or moderate side effects were reported in 9 patients(20%), who recovered without any treatment. To premature ejaculation patients with ED, sildenafil can safely and effectively improve their erectile function, the satisfaction over the ED treatment outcome means that their PE symptoms could be alleviated.","A study by Li et al treated 45 men with premature ejaculation and comorbid erectile dysfunction with sildenafil. Eighty-nine percent reported improved erectile function, and 60% reported decreased severity of premature ejaculation."
"In patients with a previous CVA, do antioxidants protect against subsequent stroke
There is conflicting evidence on the benefits of foods rich in vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol), n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), and their pharmacological substitutes. We investigated the effects of these substances as supplements in patients who had myocardial infarction. From October, 1993, to September, 1995, 11,324 patients surviving recent (< or = 3 months) myocardial infarction were randomly assigned supplements of n-3 PUFA (1 g daily, n=2836), vitamin E (300 mg daily, n=2830), both (n=2830), or none (control, n=2828) for 3.5 years. The primary combined efficacy endpoint was death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and stroke. Intention-to-treat analyses were done according to a factorial design (two-way) and by treatment group (four-way). Treatment with n-3 PUFA, but not vitamin E, significantly lowered the risk of the primary endpoint (relative-risk decrease 10% [95% CI 1-18] by two-way analysis, 15% [2-26] by four-way analysis). Benefit was attributable to a decrease in the risk of death (14% [3-24] two-way, 20% [6-33] four-way) and cardiovascular death (17% [3-29] two-way, 30% [13-44] four-way). The effect of the combined treatment was similar to that for n-3 PUFA for the primary endpoint (14% [1-26]) and for fatal events (20% [5-33]). Dietary supplementation with n-3 PUFA led to a clinically important and statistically significant benefit. Vitamin E had no benefit. Its effects on fatal cardiovascular events require further exploration.","The Italian GISSI study of 11,324 patients with a recent myocardial infarction showed no effect of vitamin E on the combined outcomes of death, myocardial infarction, and stroke."
"Does a knee brace decrease recurrent ACL injuries
The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of a knee brace after arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using central third patellar tendon autografts. Fifty patients were randomly allocated to two groups. The patients in Group A wore a brace for three weeks postoperatively, while the patients in Group B were rehabilitated without the use of a brace. Pre-operatively, the groups were comparable in terms of age, sex, activity level, knee laxity and muscle strength. The follow-up examination was performed by one independent observer. All the patients were followed up for a minimum of two years. At the follow-up, there were no significant differences between the study groups in terms of the Tegner activity level, Lysholm score, IKDC evaluation system, one-leg-hop quotient, KT-1000 measurements and isokinetic torque. Using the visual analogue scale, the patients in Group A evaluated their pain during the first two post-operative weeks as 1.0 (0-7), compared with 2.3 (0-9) in Group B (P= 0.04). Furthermore, the patients in Group A had a tendency towards fewer problems with swelling, haemathrosis and wound leakage during the early post-operative period (P=0.08). We conclude that the patients who were rehabilitated with the use of a brace had less pain and a tendency towards fewer complications during the early post-operative period than the patients who were rehabilitated without the use of a brace. However, there were no differences in terms of function or knee laxity at the two-year follow-up.",A similar study of 50 patients demonstrated no significant difference in function or laxity at 2 years.
"What is the best approach to prevention and treatment of osteoporosis
Estrogen deficiency in women is associated with accelerated bone loss, and estrogen replacement therapy has been proven to be effective in preventing osteoporosis and fractures in postmenopausal women. The introduction of selective estrogen receptor modulators that have an estrogen-like effect on the skeleton but have a different pattern of effects on other tissues may have an important role in the management of osteoporosis in women in the near future. In men, androgen deficiency has been shown to be associated with osteoporosis. Although androgen replacement in hypogonadal men may decrease bone resorption and increase bone mass, long-term placebo-controlled trials are needed to better define the benefits and risks of such therapy before it can be recommended. Sex hormone deficiency is linked to the development of osteoporosis in both women and men. In women, hormonal replacement by estrogen or the newly developed selective estrogen receptor modulators may prevent the development of osteoporosis and its related fractures. In men, there is early evidence that testosterone replacement therapy may enhance bone mass in hypogonadal men.","Testosterone replacement in men is less studied; some small studies demonstrate increased BMD, but long-term benefits are unknown."
"How should you treat Candida vaginitis in patients on antibiotics
This cohort study of 182 women attending a sexually transmitted disease clinic evaluated the hypothesis that women colonized by lactobacilli have decreased acquisition of vaginal infections. During a 2-year follow-up, 50 women acquired bacterial vaginosis (BV), 25 acquired symptomatic vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC), and 7 acquired vaginal trichomoniasis. By multivariate analysis, utilizing Cox proportional hazards modeling with time-dependent covariates, acquisition of BV was independently associated with lack of vaginal H2O2-producing lactobacilli (hazard ratio [HR] = 4.0, P < .001) or presence of only non-H2O2-producing lactobacilli (HR = 2.2, P = .02). Acquisition of BV was associated with having a new sex partner (HR = 2.5, P = .004) and with douching for hygiene (HR = 2.1, P = .05). Absence of lactobacilli did not increase acquisition of VVC. Trichomoniasis was associated only with having a new sex partner (HR = 4.7, P = .05). These results support the hypothesis that H2O2-producing vaginal lactobacilli protect against acquisition of BV but do not protect against VVC or vaginal trichomoniasis.",Decreasing Lactobacillus does not increase the risk of VVC.
"What is the target for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in patients with heart disease
In patients with high cholesterol levels, lowering the cholesterol level reduces the risk of coronary events, but the effect of lowering cholesterol levels in the majority of patients with coronary disease, who have average levels, is less clear. In a double-blind trial lasting five years we administered either 40 mg of pravastatin per day or placebo to 4159 patients (3583 men and 576 women) with myocardial infarction who had plasma total cholesterol levels below 240 mg per deciliter (mean, 209) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels of 115 to 174 mg per deciliter (mean, 139). The primary end point was a fatal coronary event or a nonfatal myocardial infarction. The frequency of the primary end point was 10.2 percent in the pravastatin group and 13.2 percent in the placebo group, an absolute difference of 3 percentage points and a 24 percent reduction in risk (95 percent confidence interval, 9 to 36 percent; P = 0.003). Coronary bypass surgery was needed in 7.5 percent of the patients in the pravastatin group and 10 percent of those in the placebo group, a 26 percent reduction (P=0.005), and coronary angioplasty was needed in 8.3 percent of the pravastatin group and 10.5 percent of the placebo group, a 23 percent reduction (P=0.01). The frequency of stroke was reduced by 31 percent (P=0.03). There were no significant differences in overall mortality or mortality from noncardiovascular causes. Pravastatin lowered the rate of coronary events more among women than among men. The reduction in coronary events was also greater in patients with higher pretreatment levels of LDL cholesterol. These results demonstrate that the benefit of cholesterol-lowering therapy extends to the majority of patients with coronary disease who have average cholesterol levels.","The intervention arm in the Cholesterol and Recurrent Events trial was also pravastatin 40 mg daily, with cholestyramine added if the low density lipoprotein level remained higher than 175 mg/dL. Subgroup analyses suggested that patients with coronary artery disease and low initial low density lipoprotein levels (< 125 mg/dL) have little to gain from pravastatin."
"Do endovascular filters prevent pulmonary embolism  as effectively as anticoagulants in patients with deep venous thrombosis
This chapter about antithrombotic therapy for venous thromboembolic disease is part of the seventh ACCP Conference on Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy: Evidence Based Guidelines. Grade 1 recommendations are strong and indicate that the benefits do, or do not, outweigh risks, burden, and costs. Grade 2 suggests that individual patients' values may lead to different choices (for a full understanding of the grading see Guyatt et al, CHEST 2004; 126:179S-187S). Among the key recommendations in this chapter are the following: for patients with objectively confirmed deep vein thrombosis (DVT), we recommend short-term treatment with subcutaneous (SC) low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or, alternatively, IV unfractionated heparin (UFH) [both Grade 1A]. For patients with a high clinical suspicion of DVT, we recommend treatment with anticoagulants while awaiting the outcome of diagnostic tests (Grade 1C+). In acute DVT, we recommend initial treatment with LMWH or UFH for at least 5 days (Grade 1C), initiation of vitamin K antagonist (VKA) together with LMWH or UFH on the first treatment day, and discontinuation of heparin when the international normalized ratio (INR) is stable and > 2.0 (Grade 1A). For the duration and intensity of treatment for acute DVT of the leg, the recommendations include the following: for patients with a first episode of DVT secondary to a transient (reversible) risk factor, we recommend long-term treatment with a VKA for 3 months over treatment for shorter periods (Grade 1A). For patients with a first episode of idiopathic DVT, we recommend treatment with a VKA for at least 6 to 12 months (Grade 1A). We recommend that the dose of VKA be adjusted to maintain a target INR of 2.5 (INR range, 2.0 to 3.0) for all treatment durations (Grade 1A). We recommend against high-intensity VKA therapy (INR range, 3.1 to 4.0) [Grade 1A] and against low-intensity therapy (INR range, 1.5 to 1.9) compared to INR range of 2.0 to 3.0 (Grade 1A). For the prevention of the postthrombotic syndrome, we recommend the use of an elastic compression stocking (Grade 1A). For patients with objectively confirmed nonmassive PE, we recommend acute treatment with SC LMWH or, alternatively, IV UFH (both Grade 1A). For most patients with pulmonary embolism (PE), we recommend clinicians not use systemic thrombolytic therapy (Grade 1A). For the duration and intensity of treatment for PE, the recommendations are similar to those for DVT.","The American College of Chest Physicians recommends considering an IVCF for patients with deep venous thrombosis who have a contraindication to anticoagulation, complication of anticoagulation, or recurrent thromboembolism despite adequate anticoagulation."
"Does the age you introduce food to an infant affect allergies later
The relationship between early solid feeding practices and risks of recurrent or chronic eczema in childhood was examined in a birth cohort of New Zealand children studied to the age of 10. By the age of 10 years, 7.5% of children had chronic or recurrent eczema. There were clear and consistent associations between the diversity of the child's diet during the first 4 months and risks of eczema. Even when due allowance was made for a range of confounding factors--including parental atopic illness, atopic illness in siblings, the child's early milk diet, and family social background--children exposed to four or more different types of solid food before 4 months had risks of recurrent or chronic eczema that were 2.9 times those of children who were not exposed to early solid feeding. It is concluded that early exposure to a diet diverse in potential food antigens may act to predispose susceptible children to recurrent or chronic childhood eczema.",A cohort study (n=1265) comparing children who had been given 4 or more types of solid food before 4 months of age with those whose caregivers delayed solid foods showed an increased incidence of eczema by 10 years of age (relative risk=2.35; P<.05) in the early feeding group.
"Which vaccinations are indicated after splenectomy
Asplenic individuals are known to be at increased risk of infection with encapsulated bacteria. Recent United Kingdom recommendations stated that this at-risk group should receive one dose of the meningococcal serogroup C conjugate (MCC) vaccine. However, the immune response of asplenic individuals to MCC vaccine is unknown. The immune response of asplenics (n = 130) to immunization with the MCC vaccine was investigated. Asplenic individuals had a significantly lower geometric mean titer (GMT) (157.8; 95% confidence interval [CI], 94.5 to 263.3) of bactericidal antibody in serum (SBA) than an age-matched control group (n = 48) (1448.2; 95% CI, 751.1 to 2792.0). However, 80% of asplenic individuals achieved the proposed protective SBA titer of > or =8. No differences were observed between the two groups in the serogroup C-specific immunoglobulin G geometric mean concentration. A significant reduction in SBA GMT or the number of responders achieving an SBA titer of > or =8 was observed if the reason for splenectomy was a medical cause or if MCC vaccination occurred <10 years after splenectomy. Individuals (n = 29) who did not achieve an SBA titer of > or =16 were offered a second dose of MCC vaccine. Analysis of the SBA response revealed that 61% (14 of 23) of the individuals who received a second dose achieved a protective titer. In total, 93% of asplenic individuals achieved a titer of > or =8 following MCC vaccination (one or two doses combined). We recommend that, following vaccination of asplenics, either the level of functional antibody should be determined, with a second dose of MCC vaccine offered to nonresponders, or two doses of MCC vaccine should be routinely offered.","In a study, 130 asplenic individuals were compared with 48 age-matched controls after receiving a meningococcal vaccine. The majority (93%) achieved bactericidal immunoglobulin levels following immunization. This study demonstrated the need to have antibody titers drawn to ensure immunization response, as 20% of the subjects required a second dose of vaccine to achieve adequate levels. No clear evidence supports the timing of the meningococcal vaccine post-splenectomy."
"How should you document a patient's refusal to undergo a necessary intervention
Many physicians believe that documenting a discharge as ""against medical advice"" protects them from legal actions for adverse consequences related to the discharge. The authors examined case law for evidence of such protection. MEDLINE and PsycINFO databases were searched for relevant articles. The medmal. base of Lexis and West Group was searched for annotated case law. Four relevant cases were found in which medical authorities and physicians were sued for medical malpractice even though they discharged a patient against medical advice. In all cases the defendants prevailed. However, their success was not due to the fact that they used the procedure of discharging patients against medical advice. Rather, it was based on the plaintiffs' failure to prove negligence. The authors offer guidelines for physicians faced with the decision to discharge against medical advice. Physicians should perform a careful and well-documented examination. They should assess the severity of illness and the severity of the risk if the patient is discharged. They should engage in a constructive dialogue with the patient about grievances. They should ensure that the patient's withholding of consent for further hospitalization is informed with respect to risks, benefits, and alternatives. If the patient meets criteria for involuntary hospitalization, the patient should be committed. Good clinical practice and thorough documentation remain the best legal protection. Discharging a patient against medical advice may provide partial protection, but it is not a royal road to legal immunity.","A study of annotated case law revealed that the ""discharge against medical advice"" forms used by some hospitals might provide little legal protection."
"Which late-stage Alzheimer's patients should be referred for hospice care
The goal of the present study was to assess the validity of the Medicare hospice eligibility guidelines for dementia patients, as well as identify predictors that could more accurately identify prognosis in dementia patients referred to hospice. A retrospective chart review was conducted, including initial assessment and longitudinal follow-up of patients until the time of death. In addition, a second validation cohort was also followed. Participants consisted of 245 patients admitted to a large community-based hospice with a diagnosis of dementia, including a validation sample of 80 patients. The Kaplan-Meier estimation of survival and a Cox regression analysis (p > 0. 05) revealed no significant relationship between the Medicare guidelines or any component of the guidelines and survival at six months for the initial and validation samples. Significant multivariate predictors of shorter survival in both the initial and validation sample include greater age (p = 0. 02) and anorexia (p < 0. 001), as well as a combination of anorexia and greater functional impairment (p = 0.005). Overall, the results indicated that the Medicare guidelines were not valid predictors of survival in hospice patients with dementia and should be altered to include empirically valid predictors. Advanced age, as well as impaired nutritional and functional status, was associated with shortened survival in these patients. The predictor variables identified are an initial step toward providing improved prognoses for advanced dementia patients, their families, and practitioners. Broader issues in improving access to hospice care for dementia patients are discussed.","A retrospective chart audit of 165 patients, and a subsequent prospective cohort study of 80 patients at comparable stages of progressive dementia who were consecutively admitted to a community-based hospice program. These patients had estimated life expectancy of less than 6 months, as certified by the attending and the hospice medical director, without use of explicit guidelines. The survival curves for patients who, in retrospect, did and did not meet Medicare guidelines were similarie, the Medicare guidelines were not statistically better at predicting 6-month survival than the clinical impressions of the attending and hospice medical director. In the 139 patients from the retrospective cohort included in the Cox regression analysis, 108 patients died within 6 months. Of those, 83 (77%) met Medicare criteria and 25 (23%) did not. Of the 31 who lived longer than 6 months, 22 (71%) met Medicare criteria and 9 (29%) did not. In the prospective cohort, of the 61 patients who died within 6 months, 39 (64%) met Medicare criteria and 22 (36%) did not; of the 18 who lived longer than 6 months, 9 met Medicare criteria (50%) and 9 did not."
"What's the best test for renal artery stenosis in patients with refractory hypertension
To review the published literature comparing the diagnostic accuracy of magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) with and without gadolinium in diagnosing renal artery stenosis, using catheter angiography as reference. A meta-analysis was performed of English language articles identified by computer search using PubMed/MEDLINE, followed by extensive bibliography review from 1985 to May 2001. Inclusion criteria were: (1) blinded comparison with catheter angiography; (2)indication for MRA stated; (3) clear descriptions of imaging techniques; and (4) interval between MRA and catheter angiography < 3 months and only the largest of all studies from one centre was selected in the analysis. A total of 39 studies were identified, of which 25 met the inclusion criteria. The number of patients included in the meta-analysis was 998: 499 with non-enhanced MRA and 499 with gadolinium-enhanced MRA. The sensitivity and specificity of non-enhanced MRA were 94% (95% CI: 90-97%) and 85% (95% CI: 82-87%), respectively. For gadolinium-enhanced MRA sensitivity was 97% (95% CI: 93-98%) and specificity was 93% (95% CI: 91-95%). Thus, specificity and positive predictive value were significantly better for gadolinium-enhanced MRA (P < 0.001). Accessory renal arteries were depicted better by gadolinium-enhanced MRA (82%; 95% CI: 75-87%) than non-gadolinium MRA (49%; 95% CI: 42-60%) (P < 0.001). Gadolinium-enhanced MRA may replace arteriography in most patients with suspected renal artery stenosis, and has major advantages in that it is non-invasive, avoids ionizing radiation and uses a non-nephrotoxic contrast agent.","Among the primary diagnostic tests for RAS, magnetic resonance arthrography is the most consistently accurate and least operator dependent-which makes it the best choice in most situations."
"What is the risk of bowel strangulation in an adult with an untreated inguinal hernia
Despite universal acceptance of the value of elective hernia repair, many patients present with incarceration or strangulation, which are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. We reviewed 147 patients who underwent emergency surgery for incarcerated groin hernias during a 10-year period in order to analyze the presentation and outcome in our practice. Median age of the patients was 70 years. There were 77 men and 70 women. Femoral hernias were seen in 77 patients and inguinal hernias in 70. Coexisting diseases were found in 82 cases (55.8%). Bowel resection was required in 19 patients (12.9%). The overall and major morbidity rates were 41.5% and 9.6%, respectively. The mortality rate was 3.4%. Longer duration of symptoms, late hospitalization, concomitant diseases, and high ASA class were found to be significant factors linked with unfavorable outcomes. Because of high morbidity and mortality associated with incarceration, elective repair of groin hernias should be done whenever possible.",The Spanish retrospective review of emergent surgical repair of incarcerated hernias (noted earlier) reported a 3.4% postoperative mortality rate. All deaths were among patients over 65 years of age and ASA class III or IV. This review also found more postoperative complications and a higher mortality for hernias present for more than 10 years.
"Do insulin-sensitizing drugs increase ovulation rates for women with PCOS
Use of metformin in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is becoming increasingly accepted and widespread, but clinical practice is ahead of the evidence. Although a wide range of benefits in metabolic, reproductive, and clinical measures have been reported from non-randomised trials with metformin, close inspection of results from the adequately controlled studies shows that the benefits are modest. Our aim in this descriptive review is not to define practice guidelines but to improve clinicians' knowledge of the available published clinical evidence, concentrating on the few randomised controlled trials. We also highlight other issues, including hirsutism, acne, pregnancy, and neonatal outcome, that require more attention before clinical recommendations for the use of metformin in PCOS can be formalised. The potentially greater benefits achievable by lifestyle changes alone are also emphasised. We hope that the review will lead to more judicious use of metformin in PCOS and a more structured approach to research.","A review of 7 RCTs describes the evidence accumulated by well-designed trials and its clinical relevance. Metformin improves ovulation and menstrual cyclicity but these improvements were variable and modest. On average, 1 additional ovulation is attained in every 5-month interval with metformin treatment; specifically, the baseline of 1 ovulation per 5-month interval increased to 2 ovulations per 5-month interval. Spontaneous ovulation and normal menstruation are achieved rapidly (within 3 months of the start of therapy). These data corroborate the benefits of metformin but place its clinical significance in perspective. For PCOS patients seeking cycle regulation but not pregnancy, oral contraceptives may remain better therapy because metformin does not normalize menses."
"How should we manage infants at risk for group B streptococcal disease
To determine whether the 1996 consensus guidelines for prevention of early-onset group B streptococcal disease developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, ACOG, and the American Academy of Pediatrics are affecting obstetric practice and disease occurrence. Personnel in hospitals with obstetric services in seven surveillance areas completed surveys about their programs, patient populations, and group B streptococcal disease prevention policies. Survey results were linked to group B streptococcal disease cases identified by active surveillance in 1996 and 1997. An early onset case was defined as a case in which group B streptococci were isolated from a sterile site in the 1st 6 days of life. The number of cases in 1996 and 1997 were compared using a paired t test. Linear regression was used to assess hospital characteristics associated with group B streptococcal disease cases. Of 177 hospitals, 165 (93%) responded, and 96 (58%) of those had group B streptococcal disease prevention policies. Hospitals that established or revised their policies in 1996 had a lower mean number of cases in 1997 than in 1996 (0.58 versus 1.29, P = .006). Linear regression analysis, controlling for number of births, indicated that a hospital's having more black mothers and location in particular states were associated with more cases of disease. Citing the 1996 ACOG reference as the source for hospital group B streptococcal disease prevention policy was associated with fewer cases of group B streptococcal disease (P = .038). The publication and adoption of the guidelines were associated with decreasing occurrence of group B streptococcal disease.",A retrospective study after the release of the 1996 Centers for Disease Control (CDC) guidelines concluded that hospitals with established group B streptococcal disease policies had significantly fewer cases of early-onset disease (P=.038).
"What medication best prevents migraine in children
Migraine according to the criteria of the International Headache Society, occurs in about 3 to 7% of all children. Despite this high incidence, and unlike the situation with adult migraine, only a very few controlled trials have investigated the acute and prophylactic treatment of migraine in children. In the acute migraine attack, ibuprofen 10 mg/kg and paracetamol (acetaminophen) 15 mg/kg have been shown to be effective, with only a few adverse effects. In severe migraine attacks, dihydroergotamine mesylate (dihydroergotamine) administered orally (20 to 40 microg/kg) or intravenously (maximum 1 mg/day) may be helpful, but there have been no large placebo-controlled trials of this treatment. Oral sumatriptan has not been effective in several double-blind and placebo-controlled trials; administered subcutaneously, this drug might be helpful but the only data for this application come from open trials. For migraine prophylaxis, only flunarizine 5 mg/day has been shown to be effective in more than 1 double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Some evidence also exists that propranolol >60 mg/day and pizotifen 0.5 to 1.5 mg/day are effective; however, the results from different trials are contradictory. For all other drugs studied in migraine prophylaxis, the results remain vague (e.g. amitriptyline, nimodipine, trazodone) or suggest inefficacy (e.g. timolol, clonidine, tryptophan). In migraine-related disorders, pizotifen 0.5 to 0.75 mg/day for abdominal migraine and flunarizine 10 to 25 mg/day for alternating hemiplegia have been shown to be effective. Most of the drugs used in the treatment of migraine in children are well tolerated and without relevant adverse effects. In migraine prophylaxis, the most common adverse effects are drowsiness and bodyweight gain.",Cyproheptadine is widely used in children but is not as effective as amitriptyline and propranolol.
"What are effective medication combinations for dyslipidemia
Combination therapy for dyslipidemia holds promise as effective treatment for patients with multiple lipid disorders, especially those at high risk. This study evaluated dose-response relationships and safety of a new dual-component drug product containing niacin extended-release (niacin ER) and lovastatin. The 28-week double-blind multicenter trial randomized 237 patients with type IIA or IIB hyperlipidemia to one of four escalating-dose treatment groups: niacin ER/lovastatin 1,000/20 mg, niacin ER/lovastatin 2,000/40 mg, niacin ER 2,000 mg, or lovastatin 40 mg. Niacin ER/lovastatin was more effective than each of its components for improving levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglycerides (TG), and exhibited a clear dose-response effect and additivity across the dosage range. The 2,000/40 dose achieved greater mean reductions in LDL-C (-42%) than 1,000/20 (-28%, p < 0.001), lovastatin 40 mg (-32%, p < 0.05), or niacin ER 2,000 mg (-14%, p < 0.05). The 2,000/40 dose was significantly more effective in increasing HDL-C levels (+30%) than the 1,000/20 dose (+21%, p = 0.016). The decrease in TG was greater with 2,000/40 (-43%) than with 1,000/20 (-26%, p = 0.009). All three niacin-containing treatments were more effective than lovastatin monotherapy in reducing lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)] levels. Flushing caused 12 (11%) patients receiving niacin ER/lovastatin and I patient receiving lovastatin alone to withdraw. No drug-related myopathy was noted. One patient each in the 2,000/40 group and the lovastatin 40-mg group had reversible elevations in liver transaminases. Niacin ER/lovastatin is well tolerated and effective for patients with multiple lipid disorders.","The combination of statin/niacin may be more desirable than statin/fibrate for patients with more severe mixed dyslipidemia, especially those with very low high density lipoprotein cholesterol values, when monotherapy regimens are not completely effective. A fixed combination of lovastatin with extended-release niacin (Advicor) is commercially available."
"Should patients with acute deep venous thrombosis limit activity
Traditionally, many patients with acute deep vein thrombosis (DVT) are treated not only by anticoagulation therapy but additionally by strict bed rest, which is aimed at reducing the risk of pulmonary embolism (PE) events. However, this risk has not been subjected to empirical verification. The Registro Informatizado de la Enfermedad TromboEmbÃ³lica is a Spanish registry of consecutively enrolled patients with objectively confirmed, symptomatic acute DVT or PE. In this analysis, the clinical characteristics, details of anticoagulant therapy, and clinical outcomes of enrolled patients with and without strict bed rest prescribed during the first 15 days were compared. Patients in whom ambulation was not possible were not included in this analysis. A total of 2,650 patients entered the study (DVT, 2,038 patients; PE, 612 patients). Of these patients, 1,050 DVT patients (52%) and 385 PE patients (63%) were prescribed strict bed rest. New events of symptomatic, objectively confirmed PE developed during the 15-day study period in 11 patients with DVT (0.5%) and 4 patients with PE (0.7%). Five of these 15 patients (33%) died as a result of their PE. Age < 65 years (odds ratio [OR], 3.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.98 to 11) and cancer (OR, 3.0; 95% CI, 0.98 to 9.1) were associated with an increased rate of new PEs. There were not significant differences between bedridden and ambulant patients in terms of new PE events, fatal PE, or bleeding complications. Our findings confirm those from previous reports suggesting that bed rest has no influence on the risk of developing PE among patients with acute DVT of the lower limbs. In addition, our findings show for the first time the lack of influence of bed rest even in patients presenting with acute submassive PE.","Data from the RIETE registry indicated that overall mortality was significantly higher in immobilized patients with a pulmonary embolism  (3.6% vs 0.5% in mobile patients; P=.01).8 Notably, immobilized patients with a pulmonary embolism  were more likely to be hypoxic and also tended to receive lower doses of LMWH. No differences were found in outcomes for patients with DVT."
"Which tests are the most useful for diagnosing pelvic inflammatory disease
A multivariate logistic regression analysis of patient symptoms and signs and laboratory findings associated with the diagnosis of acute pelvic inflammatory disease was performed with use of data from 628 women who were clinically diagnosed as having the disease for the first time at the University of Lund, Sweden. In 414 women (65.9%) acute pelvic inflammatory disease was laparoscopically confirmed. We developed a mathematical model that correctly predicted 87.0% of the cases of acute pelvic inflammatory disease and had an overall correct classification rate of 75.6%. Variables that were good predictors of acute pelvic inflammatory disease were purulent vaginal discharge, erythrocyte sedimentation rate greater than or equal to 15 mm/hr, positive gonorrhea result, adnexal swelling on bimanual examination, and rectal temperature greater than or equal to 38 degrees C. Furthermore, we developed ""mixed model I"" and ""mixed model II,"" which combine simple clinical parameters and laparoscopy in varying degrees. In mixed model I the sensitivity, specificity, and overall classification values were 93%, 67.2%, and 84.5%; in mixed model II these values were 100%, 67.2%, and 89.2%. Use of relatively simple and reproducible clinical parameters can identify those women who would most benefit from laparoscopy to diagnose acute pelvic inflammatory disease.","A study proposed the use of a clinical criteria model including low abdominal pain and 2 or more of the following other criteria: vaginal discharge, temperature greater than 38ÂºC, vomiting, irregular menses, urologic or proctitis symptoms, pelvic tenderness, adnexal mass or swelling, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate â‰¥15. This model had a reported sensitivity of 87%, specificity of 52.5%, and false-positive and false-negative rates of 21.2% and 33.3%, respectively."
"Do OTC remedies relieve cough in acute URIs
Acute cough due to upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) is a common symptom. Non-prescription over-the-counter (OTC) medicines are frequently recommended as a first-line treatment, but there is little evidence as to whether these drugs are effective. To assess the effects of oral OTC cough preparations for acute cough. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2006, Issue 4); MEDLINE (January 1966 to January Week 1, 2007); EMBASE (January 1974 to January 2007); and the UK Department of Health National Research Register (June 2007). Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing oral OTC cough preparations with placebo in children and adults suffering from acute cough in ambulatory settings. We considered all cough outcomes and second outcomes of interest were adverse effects. Two review authors independently screened potentially relevant citations and independently extracted data and assessed study quality. Quantitative analysis was performed where appropriate. Twenty five trials (17 in adults, 8 in children) involving 3492 people (2876 adults and 616 children) were included. RESULTS OF STUDIES IN ADULTS: Six trials compared antitussives with placebo and had variable results. Two trials compared the expectorant, guaifenesin with placebo, one indicated significant benefit whereas the other did not. One trial found that a mucolytic reduced cough frequency and symptom scores. Two studies examined antihistamine-decongestant combinations and found conflicting results. Three studies compared other combinations of drugs with placebo and indicated some benefit in reducing cough symptoms. Three trials found antihistamines were no more effective than placebo in relieving cough symptoms. RESULTS OF STUDIES IN CHILDREN: Antitussives (two studies), antihistamines (two studies), antihistamine decongestants (two studies) and antitussive/bronchodilator combinations (one study) were no more effective than placebo. No studies using expectorants met our inclusion criteria. The results of one trial favoured active treatment with mucolytics over placebo. One trial tested two paediatric cough syrups and both preparations showed a 'satisfactory response' in 46% and 56% of children compared to 21% of children in the placebo group. There is no good evidence for or against the effectiveness of OTC medicines in acute cough. The results of this review have to be interpreted with caution due differences in study characteristics and quality. Studies often showed conflicting results with uncertainty regarding clinical relevance. Higher quality evidence is needed to determine the effectiveness of self-care treatments for acute cough.",Two double-blinded RCTs (total of 155 children) showed that antihistamine-decongestant combinations (brompheniramine-phenylpropanolamine and brompheniramine-phenylephrine-propanolamine) did not reduce cough more than placebo. No studies have evaluated guai-fenesin in children.
"Are there any known health risks to early introduction of solids to an infant's diet
To assess the association between the introduction of solid foods in the first 12 months and the occurrence of eczema during the first 4 years of life in a prospective study of newborns. Data were taken from annually administered questionnaires from a large birth cohort (recruited 1995-1998) comprised of an intervention and a nonintervention group. Outcomes were doctor-diagnosed and symptomatic eczema. Multiple generalized estimation equation models were performed for the 2 study groups. From the 5991 recruited infants, 4753 (79%) were followed up. The 2 study groups were different in their family risk of allergies and feeding practices. No association was found between the time of introduction of solids or the diversity of solids and eczema. In the nonintervention group, a decreased risk was observed for avoidance of soybean/nuts, but an increased risk was seen in doctor-diagnosed eczema for the avoidance of egg in the first year. The evidence from this study supports neither a delayed introduction of solids beyond the fourth month nor a delayed introduction of the most potentially allergenic solids beyond the sixth month of life for the prevention of eczema. However, effects under more extreme conditions cannot be ruled out.",A German prospective cohort study (N=5991) found no benefit in delaying solids longer than 4 months or potentially allergenic solids longer than 6 months to prevent eczema.
"Should you treat carriers of pharyngeal group A strep
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) convened a Working Group in October 1995 to summarize the data regarding the risk of invasive group A streptococcal (GAS) disease among household contacts of an index patient and the potential efficacy of chemoprophylaxis. This statement on chemoprophylaxis for prevention of subsequent cases among household contacts is intended for use by public health professionals and clinicians. The CDC invited representatives of the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists, the Hospital Infection Control Practice Advisory Committee, the Infectious Diseases Society of America, and experts from academia to participate. Data on the transmission of GAS and risk factors for severe infection were considered. Population-based surveillance data were used to estimate the risk of invasive GAS disease among household contacts of a case patient. The potential efficacy of chemoprophylaxis was considered using estimates of the efficacy of various regimens in eradicating pharyngeal carriage. This document summarizes the data considered by the Working Group to develop its position. The consensus achieved by group discussion at the meeting was incorporated in a draft document, which was reviewed by all members and revised to include suggested changes. The Working Group concluded that no definite recommendations can be made at this time regarding chemoprophylaxis for household contacts of persons with invasive GAS infection. More data are needed to assess the risk of subsequent cases and to determine an optimal regimen for chemoprophylaxis. Until such data are available, physicians and health departments should base decisions regarding chemoprophylaxis on their assessment of the risk associated with each individual case.","In 1995, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention convened a consensus group to address the issue of prophylaxis for people exposed to GAS-positive carriers, but the consensus group failed to reach a definitive conclusion."
"History, exam, and labs: Is one enough to diagnose acute adult appendicitis
The importance of specific elements in the clinical diagnosis of appendicitis is controversial. This review analyses the diagnostic value of elements of disease history, clinical findings and laboratory test results in suspected appendicitis. A systematic Medline search was made of all published studies on the clinical and laboratory diagnosis of appendicitis in patients admitted to hospital with suspected disease. Meta-analyses of receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) areas, and positive and negative likelihood ratios, of 28 diagnostic variables described in 24 studies are presented. Inflammatory response variables (granulocyte count, proportion of polymorphonuclear blood cells, white blood cell count and C-reactive protein concentration), descriptors of peritoneal irritation (rebound and percussion tenderness, guarding and rigidity) and migration of pain were the strongest discriminators, with ROC areas of 0.78 to 0.68. The discriminatory power of the inflammatory variables was particularly strong for perforated appendicitis, with ROC areas of 0.85 to 0.87. Appendicitis was likely when two or more inflammatory variables were increased and unlikely when all were normal. Although all clinical and laboratory variables are weak discriminators individually, they achieve a high discriminatory power when combined. Laboratory examination of the inflammatory response, clinical descriptors of peritoneal irritation, and a history of migration of pain yield the most important diagnostic information and should be included in any diagnostic assessment.","Clinicians inherently combine multiple variables when evaluating patients, and when evaluating patients with abdominal pain, this technique can result in identification of adequate likelihood ratios. In general, when 2 or more of the aforementioned inflammatory variables are present, the diagnosis of acute appendicitis is likely. When all markers of inflammation are normal, though acute appendicitis is less likely, the power is insufficient to exclude it as a possible diagnosis."
"What is the best diagnostic approach to postmenopausal vaginal bleeding in women taking hormone replacement therapy
Postmenopausal vaginal bleeding is a common clinical problem. Endovaginal ultrasound (EVUS) is a noninvasive diagnostic test that may help determine which women should undergo endometrial biopsy. To determine the accuracy of EVUS in detecting endometrial disease in postmenopausal women with vaginal bleeding according to hormone replacement use. Literature search of English-language and non-English-language articles published from 1966 through November 1996 using MEDLINE and by a manual search of bibliographies of published articles. Studies were included if they prospectively collected EVUS measurements of endometrial thickness prior to obtaining endometrial tissue for histologic evaluation in postmenopausal women with vaginal bleeding. Of 85 studies that included data on EVUS and endometrial histology, 35 were included in the meta-analysis and included 5892 women. Articles were reviewed and independently selected and abstracted by 2 reviewers. Disagreement was resolved by consensus. The overall summary mean weighted estimates of sensitivity and specificity were calculated for thresholds of endometrial thickness from 3 to 10 mm. Using a 5-mm threshold to define abnormal endometrial thickening, 96% (95% confidence interval [CI], 94%-98%) of women with cancer had an abnormal EVUS result, whereas 92% (95% CI, 90%-93%) of women with endometrial disease (cancer, polyp, or atypical hyperplasia) had an abnormal result. This did not vary by hormone replacement use. However, the number of women with normal histology who had an abnormal EVUS result did vary by hormone replacement use. In women who were not using hormone replacement therapy, 593 (8%) with normal histological findings had an abnormal EVUS result (specificity, 92%; 95% CI, 90%-94%), whereas 1544 (23%) using hormone replacement therapy had an abnormal EVUS result (specificity, 77%; 95% CI, 75%-79%). For a postmenopausal woman with vaginal bleeding with a 10% pretest probability of endometrial cancer, her probability of cancer is 1% following a normal EVUS result. Endovaginal ultrasound has a high sensitivity for detecting endometrial cancer and other endometrial disease and can reliably identify postmenopausal women with vaginal bleeding who are highly unlikely to have significant endometrial disease so that endometrial sampling may be unnecessary.","transvaginal ultrasound showing an endometrial stripe of 5 mm or greater is more than 90% sensitive in detecting endometrial disease (cancer, complex hyperplasia, polyps). Approximately 3% of endometrial stripes are unmeasurable by transvaginal ultrasound and should be treated as abnormal. transvaginal ultrasound also shows many structural abnormalities, including those outside of the endometrium."
"Does screening for diabetes in at-risk patients improve long-term outcomes
Undiagnosed Type 2 diabetes has become a common condition in the US, comprising one-third of all cases of the disease. We believe that screening for and detection of undiagnosed Type 2 diabetes is an important endeavor. In this review we provide evidence that diabetes is a condition that is appropriate for population screening and detection. This includes evidence that: 1. Type 2 diabetes is a significant health problem. It affects more than 16 million adults in the US and places these individuals at high risk for serious complications of the eyes, nerves, kidneys, and cardiovascular system. 2. There is a latent phase before diagnosis of Type 2 diabetes. During this period of undiagnosed disease, risk factors for diabetic micro- and macrovascular complications are markedly elevated and diabetic complications are developing. 3. Diagnostic criteria for diabetes have been established and are based on plasma glucose values. These criteria define a group of individuals with significant hyperglycemia who also have a high frequency of risk factors for micro- and macrovascular disease. 4. The natural history of Type 2 diabetes is understood. In most patients, diabetes proceeds inexorably from genetic predisposition, through the stage of insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia, to beta cell failure and overt clinical disease. 5. There are effective and acceptable therapies available for Type 2 diabetes and its complications. Treating hyperglycemia to prevent complications is more effective than treating these complications after they have developed. Furthermore, guidelines for treatment to prevent cardiovascular disease in people known to have diabetes are more stringent than in those individuals who are not known to have diabetes. 6. There is a suitable test for screening for undiagnosed Type 2 diabetes that has high sensitivity and specificity - measurement of fasting plasma glucose. Guidelines for identifying persons at high risk for diabetes have been established.","It is well documented that diabetes significantly increases the risk of morbidity and mortality, especially due to retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, and coronary artery disease."
"Is an outpatient workup safe for patients with a transient ischemic attack
To determine whether admission to an acute care hospital is medically justified for all patients with acute stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) and whether those patients for whom admission is justified can be identified in the emergency department. Retrospective descriptive study. Urban county teaching hospital. Consecutive adult patients seen in an ED with nonhemorrhagic stroke, TIA, or hemorrhagic stroke. Admission to an acute care hospital was deemed medically justified when the patient had any of the following criteria: another diagnosis that warranted admission, an inadequate home situation, altered mental status, or an adverse event during hospitalization or if they underwent hospital-based treatment that could not be provided on an outpatient basis. One hundred sixty-eight patients were seen during a 1-year period: 120 had an ED diagnosis of nonhemorrhagic stroke, 22 had a diagnosis of TIA, and 26 had a diagnosis of hemorrhagic stroke. One hundred sixty-one patients (96%) were admitted to our hospital. Sixty-three of the 161 admissions (39%) were retrospectively categorized as medically justified. Seventeen of the 63 patients (27%) whose admissions were medically justified developed the criteria justifying their admission after leaving the ED. The practice of admitting all patients with nonhemorrhagic stroke, TIA, or hemorrhagic stroke to an acute care hospital is medically justified because the ED evaluation cannot reliably identify patients whose condition will worsen.","In a retrospective case review of TIA and stroke patients, the hospital admissions of 4 of 21 TIA patients were retrospectively categorized as medically justified. Admission was categorized as medically justified if the patient had 1 or more of the following criteria: another diagnosis that warranted admission, inadequate home situation, altered mental status, an adverse event during hospitalization including worsening of the deficit, and if the patient underwent some hospital-based treatment that could not be provided on an out-patient basis. Ease and rapidity of evaluation was not considered medically justifiable and outcome improvement (stroke prevention) was not studied."
"Should patients with acute deep venous thrombosis limit activity
Treatment of acute deep venous thrombosis (DVT) with low-molecular-weight heparin and vitamin K-antagonists reduces the risk of thrombus progression and pulmonary embolism but has no immediate effect on signs and symptoms. We addressed the question whether adding compression and walking would lead to a more rapid clinical improvement than bed rest. Fifty-three symptomatic outpatients with proximal DVT were randomly treated, in addition to dalteparin and phenprocoumon, with either firm inelastic bandages (n=18), elastic compression stockings (n=18), both combined with immediate deliberate ambulation, or bed rest without any compression (n=17). We assessed daily walking distance, well-being, quality of life, pain, swelling and clinical scores over a period of 9 days. Lung scans and ultrasound of the leg were performed on days 0 and 9. In the compression groups the walking distance increased with time to 4 km/day on average. Improvement of well-being and DVT-related quality of life was significantly faster and more pronounced with compression than with bed rest (p<0.05 for stockings, p<0.001 for bandages). Pain monitored by visual analogue scale decreased with time in a linear pattern in all groups (p<0.001). There was a significant difference between the groups (p<0.01), the best effect being achieved with bandages. Pain assessed by a provocation test was reduced by half on day 3 with bed rest but remained constantly present over the subsequent 6 days. With compression it was reduced to near baseline on day 3. Swelling was almost completely removed with compression and clinical scores also improved more than with bed rest (p<0.001). Thrombus progression, as studied with ultrasound, was less frequent and less pronounced in the compression groups than with bed rest. There was no difference of new pulmonary embolism on repeat lung scans. Leg compression combined with walking is the better alternative to bed rest for the treatment of symptomatic outpatients with proximal DVT.",A multicenter randomized controlled trials showed that thrombus progression occurred more often in patients who were treated with bed rest compared with patients treated with ambulation and compression (P<.01).
"Which treatments are effective for cervical radiculopathy
Cervical spondylosis causes pain and disability by compressing the spinal cord or roots. Surgery to relieve the compression may reduce the pain and disability, but is associated with a small but definite risk. We sought to assess the balance of risk and benefit from surgery. To determine whether: 1) surgical treatment of cervical radiculopathy or myelopathy is associated with improved outcome, compared with conservative management and 2) timing of surgery (immediate or delayed upon persistence/progression of relevant symptoms and signs) has an impact on outcome. We searched Medline (between 1966 and 1998), Embase (between 1980 and 1998) and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register. Authors of the identified randomised controlled trials were contacted to detect any additional published or unpublished data. All unconfounded truly or quasi-randomised controlled trials allocating patients with cervical radiculopathy or myelopathy to 1) ""best medical management"" or ""decompressive surgery (with or without some form of fusion) plus best medical management"" 2) ""early decompressive surgery"" or ""delayed decompressive surgery"". Two authors independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed trial quality and extracted the data. Two trials involving a total of 130 patients were included. One trial with 81 patients compared surgical decompression with either physiotherapy or cervical collar immobilization in patients with cervical radiculopathy. The short-term effects of surgery, in terms of pain, weakness or sensory loss were superior, however, at one year no significant differences between groups were present. One trial with 49 patients compared the effects of surgery with those of conservative treatment in patients with mild functional deficit associated with cervical myelopathy. No significant differences were observed between groups, up to two years following treatment. The available small randomised trials do not provide reliable evidence on the effects of surgery for cervical spondylotic radiculopathy or myelopathy. It is not clear whether the short-term risks of surgery are offset by any long-term benefits.",A 1994 community-based epidemiological survey of 561 patients showed that 75% of patients had a spontaneous symptomatic improvement within 5 years. Earlier studies (6 studies from 1957 to 1972) concluded that untreated patients wouldn't necessarily develop progressive disability and that patients with severe disability sometimes improve without treatment.
"Which asthma patients should get the pneumococcal vaccine
This retrospective cohort study evaluated the effectiveness of a 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine in reducing hospital admission for pneumonia, otitis media and exacerbation of asthma or other syndromes due to Streptococcus pneumoniae in 9170 high-risk individuals. Cohort members were followed from 1 January 1998 to 31 December 2002. With regard to preventing hospitalization due to pneumonia, we observed a decrease in the incidence of 1/10000 person-months and a reduction in the relative risk of 38% in the vaccinated cohort compared with the non-vaccinated subjects. A decrease in the risk of hospital admission for asthma, acute otitis media, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and other respiratory infections was also observed in vaccinated compared with non-vaccinated subjects. The specificity of these findings was confirmed by the lack of a protective effect from vaccination for those outcomes, such as hospitalization 'for all causes' and 'other otorhinolaryngological diagnoses', that were not directly related to pneumococcal disease.","Because the investigators did not analyze asthma-related or pneumonia-related hospitalizations among asthmatic patients 64 years and younger, the effect of pneumococcal vaccination on this younger subgroup can't be differentiated from the entire group of patients with asthma."
"What treatments are effective for varicose veins
Conservative therapy of chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) consists largely of compression treatment. However, this often causes discomfort and has been associated with poor compliance, which renders oral drug treatment an attractive option. To review the evidence from rigorous clinical trials assessing the efficacy and safety of oral horse chestnut seed extract (HCSE) versus placebo, or reference therapy for the treatment of CVI. Publications describing randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of HCSE for chronic venous insufficiency were sought through EMBASE, MEDLINE, Amed, and Phytobase (from inception to January 2001), The Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (Issue 1, 2001) and the Specialised Trials Register of the Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group (April 2001). Manufacturers of HCSE preparations and experts on the subject were contacted and asked to contribute published and unpublished material. There were no restrictions on the language of publication. Randomised controlled trials of oral HCSE mono-preparations for patients with CVI were included. Trials comparing HCSE with placebo or reference medications were included. Trials assessing HCSE as one of several active components in a combination preparation or as a part of a combination treatment were excluded. Data were extracted systematically and methodological quality was evaluated using a standard scoring system. The screening of studies, selection, data extraction and the assessment of methodological quality were performed independently by two reviewers. Disagreements concerning evaluation of individual trials were resolved through discussion. Overall, the included placebo controlled trials suggest an improvement in CVI related signs and symptoms. Leg pain was assessed in six placebo-controlled trials that reported a significant reduction of leg pain in the HCSE groups compared with the placebo groups. One trial, which reported adequate data suggested a weighted mean difference (WMD) of 42.4 mm [95% confidence interval (CI) 34.9-49.9] measured on a 100 mm visual analogue scale. Leg volume was assessed in five placebo-controlled trials. Meta-analysis of four trials (n = 239) reporting adequate data suggested a significant reduction in favour of HCSE compared with placebo (WMD 58.6 ml [95% CI 24.9-92.2]). One trial indicated that HCSE may be as effective as treatment with compression stockings. Adverse effects are usually mild and infrequent. The evidence presented implies that HCSE is an efficacious and safe short-term treatment for CVI. However several caveats exist and more rigorous RCTs are required to assess the efficacy of this treatment option.","A Cochrane Review did find that horse chestnut seed extract significantly improves leg pain, edema, pruritus, and lower leg volume and circumference, but suggests that larger randomized trials are needed to establish conclusively this agent's efficacy."
"What is the best way to diagnose polycystic ovarian syndrome
The diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is primarily achieved through clinical history and physical findings. The principle features are hirsutism or biochemical evidence of excess androgen production and irregular menstrual bleeding caused by the chronic anovulation. Associated findings include insulin resistance with compensatory hyperinsulinemia and obesity. Ultrasound imaging of the ovary has facilitated the diagnosis. It is important to exclude conditions that may mimic PCOS, such as hyperthecosis, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, 21-hydroxylase deficiency, Cushing's syndrome, and androgen-producing neoplasms. These disorders are usually revealed by appropriate laboratory assessment. Screening tests include measurement of serum total testosterone, DHEA sulfate, and 17-hydroxyprogesterone. In addition, in the obese individual, determinations of glucose and insulin levels, as well as a lipid profile, are highly recommended.","Secondary causes of hyperandrogenism may be suggested by clinical findings, including 1) abrupt onset, short duration, or sudden progressive worsening of hirsutism; 2) onset of symptoms in the third decade of life or later; or 3) signs of virilization (deepening voice, clitoromegaly)."
"What interventions reduce the risk of contrast nephropathy for high-risk patients
Contrast nephropathy is associated with increased in-hospital morbidity and mortality and leads to extension of hospital stay in patients with chronic renal insufficiency. Acetylcysteine seems to be a safe and inexpensive way to reduce contrast nephropathy. We aimed to assess the efficacy of acetylcysteine to prevent contrast nephropathy after administration of radiocontrast media in patients with chronic renal insufficiency. We did a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials comparing acetylcysteine and hydration with hydration alone for preventing contrast nephropathy in patients with chronic renal insufficiency. The trials were identified through a combined search of the BIOSIS+/RRM, MEDLINE, Web of Science, Current Contents Medizin, and The Cochrane Library Databases. We used incidence of contrast nephropathy 48 h after administration of radiocontrast media as an outcome measure. Seven trials including 805 patients were eligible according to our inclusion criteria and were analysed. Overall incidence of contrast nephropathy varied between 8% and 28%. Since significant heterogeneity was indicated by the Q statistics (p=0.016) we used a random-effects model to combine the data. Compared with periprocedural hydration alone, administration of acetylcysteine and hydration significantly reduced the relative risk of contrast nephropathy by 56% (0.435 [95% CI 0.215-0.879], p=0.02) in patients with chronic renal insufficiency. Meta-regression revealed no significant relation between the relative risk of contrast nephropathy and the volume of radiocontrast media administered or the degree of chronic renal insufficiency before the procedure. Compared with periprocedural hydration alone, acetylcysteine with hydration significantly reduces the risk of contrast nephropathy in patients with chronic renal insufficiency. The relative risk of contrast nephropathy was not related to the amount of radiocontrast media given or to the degree of chronic renal insufficiency before the procedure.","Periprocedural administration of acetylcysteine reduces the risk of contrast nephropathy in high-risk patients (odds ratio=0.56; 95% confidence interval, 0.37-0.84)."
"Are any alternative therapies effective in treating asthma
A variety of manual therapies with similar postulated biologic mechanisms of action are commonly used to treat patients with asthma. Manual therapy practitioners are also varied, including physiotherapists, respiratory therapists, chiropractic and osteopathic physicians. A systematic review across disciplines is warranted. To evaluate the evidence for the effects of manual therapies for treatment of patients with bronchial asthma. We searched for trials in computerized general (EMBASE, CINAHL and MEDLINE) and specialized databases (Cochrane Complementary Medicine Field, Cochrane Rehabilitation Field, Index to Chiropractic Literature (ICL), and Manual, Alternative and Natural Therapy (MANTIS)). In addition, we assessed bibliographies from included studies, and contacted authors of known studies for additional information about published and unpublished trials. Date of most recent search: August 2004. Trials were included if they: (1) were randomised; (2) included asthmatic children or adults; (3) examined one or more types of manual therapy; and (4) included clinical outcomes with observation periods of at least two weeks. All three reviewers independently extracted data and assessed trial quality using a standard form. From 473 unique citations, 68 full text articles were retrieved and evaluated, which resulted in nine citations to three RCTs (156 patients) suitable for inclusion. Trials could not be pooled statistically because studies that addressed similar interventions used disparate patient groups or outcomes. The methodological quality of one of two trials examining chiropractic manipulation was good and neither trial found significant differences between chiropractic spinal manipulation and a sham manoeuvre on any of the outcomes measured. One small trial compared massage therapy with a relaxation control group and found significant differences in many of the lung function measures obtained. However, this trial had poor reporting characteristics and the data have yet to be confirmed. There is insufficient evidence to support the use of manual therapies for patients with asthma. There is a need to conduct adequately-sized RCTs that examine the effects of manual therapies on clinically relevant outcomes. Future trials should maintain observer blinding for outcome assessments, and report on the costs of care and adverse events. Currently, there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of manual therapy for patients with asthma.","A Cochrane review of 3 moderate- to poor-quality RCTs with 156 participants reported no significant effect of chiropractic spinal manipulation (2 trials) or massage therapy (1 trial) on lung function, asthma symptoms, or medication use."
"Does a low-fat diet help prevent breast cancer
Breast cancer accounts for over one third of invasive cancers in women. Earlier detection and improved initial treatments have resulted in an increasing number of women who have completed standard treatments but who remain at risk for breast cancer recurrence or early death. Epidemiological studies have linked diet composition with prognosis, and many women attempt to modify their diets and improve nutritional status following diagnosis The hypothesis that dietary factors may reduce risk for secondary cancer events and increase survival in this population is currently under study in two large randomized clinical trials: the Women's Intervention Nutrition Study (WINS) and the Women's Healthy Eating and Living (WHEL) Study. The WHEL Study is testing the effect of a diet high in vegetables, fruit, and fiber, and low in fat, on disease-free survival in women with early stage breast cancer. Hypothesized mechanisms include effects of diet modification on gonadal hormones, retinoid-like activities of carotenoids, and other protective effects of biologically active dietary constituents.","Preliminary evidence indicates that lowering dietary fat consumption may help with secondary prevention of breast cancer, but no large studies have been performed to date."
"What is the initial work-up in the diagnosis of hypertension
Microalbuminuria (MA) is a well recognized marker of cardiovascular complications in hypertension, but whether MA can predict adverse outcome in this clinical condition is still a subject for debate. The fact that in hypertensive cohorts those patients who showed an increase in albumin excretion rate also manifested an increased incidence of morbid events indicates that the presence of MA in hypertension may carry an increased cardiovascular risk. However, the prognostic significance of MA remains controversial because no results of prospective studies performed in hypertensive subjects without diabetes mellitus are available. Several factors can affect the prevalence of MA in hypertension, including severity of the disease, selection procedures, concomitant risk factors, degree of obesity, age, and sex distribution. This accounts for the large differences in the prevalence of MA that can be found in the literature, with prevalence rates going from a low of 4.7% to a high of 40%. There is still conflict over whether MA in hypertension is due to increased intraglomerular pressure or to glomerular damage. The data from the literature suggest that in subjects with mild hypertension the main determinant of albumin excretion rate is the haemodynamic load. In subjects with more severe hypertension and hypertensive complications, the augmented urinary albumin leak is probably the consequence of a systemic microvascular disturbance which involves the glomeruli. In this respect, the insulin resistance state often associated to high blood pressure appears as one of the main pathogenetic factors. Whether management of hypertensive populations may be improved by monitoring of albumin excretion rate and whether antihypertensive drugs which are more effective in decreasing urinary albumin can be more beneficial in patients with MA remains to be determined.",It is unclear whether microalbuminuria results from the increased intraglomerular pressure in hypertension or if it represents glomerular damage.
"Should we use SSRIs to treat adolescents with depression
Questions concerning the safety of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in the treatment of depression in children led us to compare and contrast published and unpublished data on the risks and benefits of these drugs. We did a meta-analysis of data from randomised controlled trials that evaluated an SSRI versus placebo in participants aged 5-18 years and that were published in a peer-reviewed journal or were unpublished and included in a review by the Committee on Safety of Medicines. The following outcomes were included: remission, response to treatment, depressive symptom scores, serious adverse events, suicide-related behaviours, and discontinuation of treatment because of adverse events. Data for two published trials suggest that fluoxetine has a favourable risk-benefit profile, and unpublished data lend support to this finding. Published results from one trial of paroxetine and two trials of sertraline suggest equivocal or weak positive risk-benefit profiles. However, in both cases, addition of unpublished data indicates that risks outweigh benefits. Data from unpublished trials of citalopram and venlafaxine show unfavourable risk-benefit profiles. Published data suggest a favourable risk-benefit profile for some SSRIs; however, addition of unpublished data indicates that risks could outweigh benefits of these drugs (except fluoxetine) to treat depression in children and young people. Clinical guideline development and clinical decisions about treatment are largely dependent on an evidence base published in peer-reviewed journals. Non-publication of trials, for whatever reason, or the omission of important data from published trials, can lead to erroneous recommendations for treatment. Greater openness and transparency with respect to all intervention studies is needed.",A meta-analysis including both published and unpublished trials of SSRI medications found that fluoxetine was more likely than placebo to cause remission of symptoms after 7 to 8 weeks of treatment (number needed to treat [NNT]=6). Fluoxetine treatment was also associated with a reduction in symptom scores as measured with the CDRS-R (NNT=5).
"Do endovascular filters prevent pulmonary embolism  as effectively as anticoagulants in patients with deep venous thrombosis
In a randomized trial in patients with proximal deep-vein thrombosis, permanent vena cava filters reduced the incidence of pulmonary embolism but increased that of deep-vein thrombosis at 2 years. An 8-year follow-up was performed to assess their very long-term effect. Four hundred patients with proximal deep-vein thrombosis with or without pulmonary embolism were randomized either to receive or not receive a filter in addition to standard anticoagulant treatment for at least 3 months. Data on vital status, venous thromboembolism, and postthrombotic syndrome were obtained once a year for up to 8 years. All documented events were reviewed blindly by an independent committee. Outcome data were available in 396 patients (99%). Symptomatic pulmonary embolism occurred in 9 patients in the filter group (cumulative rate 6.2%) and 24 patients (15.1%) in the no-filter group (P=0.008). Deep-vein thrombosis occurred in 57 patients (35.7%) in the filter group and 41 (27.5%) in the no-filter group (P=0.042). Postthrombotic syndrome was observed in 109 (70.3%) and 107 (69.7%) patients in the filter and no-filter groups, respectively. At 8 years, 201 (50.3%) patients had died (103 and 98 patients in the filter and no-filter groups, respectively). At 8 years, vena cava filters reduced the risk of pulmonary embolism but increased that of deep-vein thrombosis and had no effect on survival. Although their use may be beneficial in patients at high risk of pulmonary embolism, systematic use in the general population with venous thromboembolism is not recommended.","One randomized controlled trials examined pulmonary embolism  rates in 400 patients with acute proximal deep venous thrombosis who were randomized to receive or not receive a permanent IVCF and also randomized to receive either unfractionated heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin for at least the first 3 months. Patients with a contraindication to anticoagulation or history of anticoagulation failure were excluded. After 8 years of follow-up, symptomatic pulmonary embolism  occurred less often in the filter group than the nonfilter group (6.2% vs 15.1%; P=.008; hazard ratio [HR]=0.36, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.17-0.77; number needed to treat [NNT]=11.2). The filter group had a higher incidence of recurrent deep venous thrombosis than the nonfilter group (35.7% vs 27.5%; HR=1.52, 95% CI, 1.02-2.27; number needed to harm=12.2)."
"Should we screen for bacterial vaginosis in those at risk for preterm labor
To assess the ability of clindamycin vaginal cream to reduce the incidence of preterm birth in women with abnormal genital tract flora in the second trimester of pregnancy. This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, tricenter study. A total of 409 women with abnormal genital tract flora on Gram stain of vaginal secretions at 13-20 weeks' gestation were randomized to receive a 3-day course of clindamycin vaginal cream or placebo. Those women who still had abnormal vaginal flora 3 weeks later received a 7-day course of the original study drug (ie, either clindamycin vaginal cream or placebo as per original randomization). The primary outcome measure was the incidence of preterm birth. There was a statistically significant reduction in the incidence of preterm birth in the clindamycin vaginal cream group (4%) compared with placebo (10%) (P <.03). Significantly more babies born preterm (63%) required admission to the neonatal intensive care unit compared with term infants (4%) (P <.001). A 2% clindamycin vaginal cream, when compared with placebo administered to women with abnormal genital tract flora before 20 weeks' gestation, can reduce the incidence of preterm birth by 60% and hence the need for neonatal intensive care.","In 2003, a randomized controlled trials evaluating the early treatment of asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis in low- and high-risk patients showed a decrease in preterm labor. The randomized controlled trials included 409 asymptomatic women between 13 and 20 weeks gestation with bacterial vaginosis by Gram stain using Nugent's criteria. Investigators randomized women to intravaginal clindamycin each night for 3 days. At a second visit, 20 to 24 days after treatment, women were retested for bacterial vaginosis and if they were positive, they received a 7-day course of intravaginal clindamycin or placebo based on the previous randomization. In this study, the incidence of preterm birth was reduced from 10% to 4% (relative risk [RR]=0.38; 95% CI, 0.16-0.90; NNT=17).

"What treatment works best for tennis elbow
This review is one in a series of reviews of interventions for lateral elbow pain. Lateral elbow pain, or tennis elbow, is a common condition causing pain in the elbow and forearm and lack of strength and function of the elbow and wrist. Acupuncture has long been used to treat lateral elbow pain in China and in Western countries practitioners and consumers are increasingly exploring acupuncture as a first line treatment for musculoskeletal disorders. No previous systematic review of the available evidence has been conducted to determine whether acupuncture is efficacious in the treatment lateral elbow pain. To determine the effectiveness of acupuncture in the treatment of adults with lateral elbow pain with respect to pain reduction, improvement in function, grip strength and adverse effects. We searched MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE and SCISEARCH and the Cochrane Clinical Trials Register and the Musculoskeletal Review Group's specialist trial database from 1966 to June 2001. Identified keywords and authors were searched in an effort to retrieve as many trials as possible. Two independent reviewers assessed all identified trials against pre-determined inclusion criteria. Randomised and pseudo randomised trials in all languages were included in the review provided they were testing acupuncture compared to placebo or another intervention in adults with lateral elbow pain (tennis elbow). Outcomes of interest were pain, function, disability, quality of life, strength, participant satisfaction with treatment and adverse effect. For continuous variables means and standard deviations were extracted or imputed to allow the analysis of weighted mean difference, while for binary data numbers of events and total population were analysed and interpreted as relative risks. Trial results were combined only in the absence of clinical and statistical heterogeneity. Four small randomized controlled trials were included but due to flaws in study designs (particularly small populations, uncertain allocation concealment and substantial loss to follow up) and clinical differences between trials, data from trials could not be combined in a meta-analysis. One randomised controlled trial found that needle acupuncture results in relief of pain for significantly longer than placebo (WMD = 18.8 hours, 95%CI 10.1 to 27.5) and is more likely to result in a 50% or greater reduction in pain after 1 treatment (RR 0.33, 95%CI 0.16 to 0.69) (Molsberger 1994). A second randomized controlled trial demonstrated needle acupuncture to be more likely to result in overall participant reported improvement than placebo in the short term (RR = 0.09 95% CI 0.01 to 0.64) (Haker 1990a). No significant differences were found in the longer term (after 3 or 12 months). A randomized controlled trial of laser acupuncture versus placebo demonstrated no differences between laser acupuncture and placebo with respect to overall benefit (Haker 1990b). A fourth included trial published in Chinese demonstrated no difference between Vitamin B12 injection plus acupuncture, and Vitamin B12 injection alone (Wang 1997). There is insufficient evidence to either support or refute the use of acupuncture (either needle or laser) in the treatment of lateral elbow pain. This review has demonstrated needle acupuncture to be of short term benefit with respect to pain, but this finding is based on the results of 2 small trials, the results of which were not able to be combined in meta-analysis. No benefit lasting more than 24 hours following treatment has been demonstrated. No trial assessed or commented on potential adverse effect. Further trials, utilising appropriate methods and adequate sample sizes, are needed before conclusions can be drawn regarding the effect of acupuncture on tennis elbow.","An individual RCT, cited in a Cochrane review, showed acupuncture had a very short-term benefit for pain relief compared with placebo (WMD=18.8 hours; 95% CI, 10.1-27.5). Another individual RCT, which was not included in the meta-analysis because of methodologic problems in the other studies, found that a short course of 10 acupuncture treatments resulted in an excellent or good outcome as reported by participants compared with placebo (RR=0.09; 95% CI, 0.01-0.64; NNT=4). No benefit was noted after 3 or 12 months."
"For fibromyalgia, which treatments are the most effective
The optimal management of fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) is unclear and comprehensive evidence-based guidelines have not been reported. To provide up-to-date evidence-based guidelines for the optimal treatment of FMS. DATA SOURCES, SELECTION, AND EXTRACTION: A search of all human trials (randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials) of FMS was made using Cochrane Collaboration Reviews (1993-2004), MEDLINE (1966-2004), CINAHL (1982-2004), EMBASE (1988-2004), PubMed (1966-2004), Healthstar (1975-2000), Current Contents (2000-2004), Web of Science (1980-2004), PsychInfo (1887-2004), and Science Citation Indexes (1996-2004). The literature review was performed by an interdisciplinary panel, composed of 13 experts in various pain management disciplines, selected by the American Pain Society (APS), and supplemented by selected literature reviews by APS staff members and the Utah Drug Information Service. A total of 505 articles were reviewed. There are major limitations to the FMS literature, with many treatment trials compromised by short duration and lack of masking. There are no medical therapies that have been specifically approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for management of FMS. Nonetheless, current evidence suggests efficacy of low-dose tricyclic antidepressants, cardiovascular exercise, cognitive behavioral therapy, and patient education. A number of other commonly used FMS therapies, such as trigger point injections, have not been adequately evaluated. Despite the chronicity and complexity of FMS, there are pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions available that have clinical benefit. Based on current evidence, a stepwise program emphasizing education, certain medications, exercise, cognitive therapy, or all 4 should be recommended.","Three RCTs have shown that tramadol (with or without acetaminophen) is more effective than placebo in improving pain, number of tender points and fibromyalgia impact questionnaire score."
"What's the best drug treatment for premature ejaculation
To compare the efficacy of sildenafil (Viagra) only, sildenafil plus topical anesthetic cream (EMLA), and topical EMLA-cream-only to that of placebo in treating premature ejaculation. A total of 84 patients were enrolled in this study. The duration of premature ejaculation in the patients ranged from 9 to 60 months (mean 32.5 +/- 14.6). Patients were randomized into four groups. Group 1 consisted of 20 patients who took placebo for 2 months. Groups 2 and 3 consisted of 20 and 22 patients, respectively, and they received 50 mg sildenafil 45 minutes before coitus for 2 months. In addition, patients in group 3 applied topical EMLA cream to the glans penis 15 minutes before coitus. The 22 patients in group 4 used topical EMLA-cream-only. After at least eight sexual attempts, the patients' clinical responses were assessed using the patient self-description method. Effectiveness was described as improvement plus cure. The effectiveness was 40% in group 1, 55% in group 2, 86.4% in group 3, and 77.3% in group 4. Of the groups, a significant difference was found in the effectiveness of the treatments (Pearson chi-square= 0.00). No significant difference was found between groups 1 and 2 (P = 0.26). Efficacy was more successful in groups 3 and 4 than in the others (P = 0.00). The difference between groups 3 and 4 was not significant (Pearson chi-square = 0.42). Sildenafil-only was not superior to placebo or combination treatment. Topical EMLA-cream-only had equal effectiveness to that of sildenafil plus topical EMLA treatment. The use of topical EMLA-cream-only seems to be an effective treatment of premature ejaculation.","An randomized controlled trials (N=84) compared EMLA cream applied 15 minutes prior to intercourse, sildenafil 50 mg orally 45 minutes prior to intercourse, EMLA cream plus sildenafil, and placebo. In the sildenafil-plus-EMLA group, 32% of the patients reported ""improvement"" and 54% reported ""cure"", which was defined as ejaculation delayed until the patient wished it. In the EMLA-only group, 27% of the patients reported ""improvement"" and 50% reported ""cure."" This was a statistically significant difference when compared with the placebo and sildenafil-only groups (number needed to treat [NNT]=3). There was no significant difference in reports of ""improvement"" or ""cure"" between the placebo and sildenafil-only groups."
"Do endovascular filters prevent PE as effectively as anticoagulants in patients with deep venous thrombosis
This report characterizes risk factors in patients who suffer pulmonary embolus (PE) after insertion of vena caval filter (VCF) and formulates an organized diagnostic and therapeutic plan of management. Three hundred eighteen patients were included in a review of patients undergoing insertion of VCF from 1989 to 1995. Ten patients (six men and four women, ages 25-72 years) from this group (3.1%) experienced PE after VCF insertion. Risk factors for deep venous thrombosis were documented in these ten patients. Venacavography was performed after diagnosis of PE. Thrombus length measured from the apex of the filter was used to determine further therapy. Thrombus 5 cm or greater in length was treated with a second VCF (VCF-2). Smaller clots were treated with anticoagulation (AC). All patients treated with AC underwent repeat vena caval study (CT scan or venacavagram) 10 days to 18 months after treatment. PE occurred from 8 days to 5.5 years after original VCF insertion. Five patients suffered PE longer than 6 months (range, 21-66 months; mean, 39 months) after VCF insertion. Venacavagrams demonstrated thrombus in all ten patients with PE. Six patients were treated with VCF-2 and four patients with AC. Dissolution of thrombus was seen on follow-up in all patients given AC. All 10 patients harbored at least two risk factors for deep venous thrombosis. Malignancy was found in only two patients. Five patients were found to have procoagulant states characterized by decreased levels of anti-thrombin III or protein C or S. No postoperative deaths or early recurrent PE occurred. One patient experienced another PE 5 years after treatment with AC when she discontinued warfarin. Contraindications to AC appeared to be self-limited, and all patients were discharged on warfarin. No significant bleeding occurred during early follow-up. Our findings confirm the reliability and low complication rate for VCF. Patients experiencing PE after insertion of VCF mandate an aggressive diagnostic approach that should include venacavography and a search for identifiable risk factors including procoagulant state. Treatment with AC and insertion of a second VCF both give favorable results. All patients appear to benefit from short- or long-term warfarin therapy, and contraindications to AC frequently are self-limited. Therapy based on clot size warrants further study.","A retrospective cohort study (N=318) concluded that 3.1% of the patients with IVCFs had a recurrent PE, diagnosed radiographically"
"Should patients with acute deep venous thrombosis limit activity
Traditionally, patients with acute deep vein thrombosis (DVT) are treated with strict bed rest for several days to avoid clots from breaking off and causing pulmonary emboli. The purpose of this study is to give a precise estimate of short term complications like pulmonary embolism, bleeding, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) and death in a cohort of consecutive patients who were admitted because of acute symptomatic DVT, all treated by compression and walking exercises instead of conventional bed-rest and nearly all by low-molecular-weight heparin. In 1289 consecutive patients the following five endpoints were registered for the period of hospital-stay: 1. Frequency of pulmonary embolism (PE) at admission (V/Q lung scan), 2. Frequency of new PE's after 10 days (second lung scan), 3. Fatal events (autopsy), 4. Frequency of malignant disease, 5. Bleeding complications and HIT. 1. 190/356 (53.4% of iliofemoral, 355/675 (52.6%) of femoral and 84/239 (35.1%) of lower leg vein thrombosis showed PE (difference iliofemoral and femoral versus lower leg DVT p < 0.001). Two thirds of these PE were asymptomatic. 2. New PE after 10 days in comparison to the baseline scan occurred in 7.4%, 6.4% and 3.4% respectively. 3. Fatal events, all investigated by autopsy, were caused by PE in 3 patients aged over 76 years (0.23%), by malignant diseases in 12 (0.9%) and due to other causes in 2 (0.15%). 4. 232 patients (18%) had associated malignant diseases, from which 33% were detected by our screening. 5. Non-fatal bleeding complications were seen in 3.3%, including 5 patients (0.4%) with major bleeding. Three patients (0.2%) suffered from HIT II. The low incidence of recurrent and fatal pulmonary emboli in this series affirms the value of early ambulation with heavy leg compression in patients with symptomatic acute leg deep venous thrombosis. In addition, the presence of pulmonary emboli in one-third of those with calf vein thrombi emphasizes the importance of fully diagnosing and treating calf clots.","In a cohort, the mortality rate was also 0.2%, and all deaths occurred in patients older than 70 years."
"Are tympanostomy tubes indicated for recurrent acute otitis media
Increasing concerns over drug-resistant bacteria mandate that alternative methods of treatment and prevention, including surgery, be considered to reduce antibiotic usage for acute otitis media (AOM). Meta-analysis of five randomized trials of tubes versus no surgery showed a mean absolute decrease in AOM incidence of 1.0 episode per child-year (95% CI, 0.4-1.6), with a relative decrease of 56%. Similarly, the prevalence of middle-ear effusion decreased by 115 days per child-year (95% CI, 11-220). Within several weeks of tube placement 79% of children had improved quality of life, 17% had trivial change, and 4% were worse. Systematic review of 134 articles revealed transient post-operative otorrhea in 16% of patients with tubes, and later in 26%; recurrent otorrhea occurred in 7.4% of patients and chronic otorrhea in 3.8% Adenoidectomy reduced AOM incidence by 0.32 episodes per child-year (95% CI, 0.03-0.61) for a 3-year period in one study (26% relative decrease), but the effect was only significant for children with prior tubes. Surgical therapy of otitis media offers significant benefits and is an effective prevention strategy in selected children.",A meta-analysis reporting sequelae of tympanostomy tubes found an absolute complication rate of 26% for transient otorrhea and 4% for chronic otorrhea.
"Menstrual disturbances in perimenopausal women: What's best
Heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) or menorrhagia is an important cause of ill health in women. Surgical treatment of HMB often follows failed or ineffective medical therapy and the definitive treatment is hysterectomy but this is a major surgical procedure with significant physical and emotional complications and social and economic costs. A number of less invasive surgical techniques (e.g. endometrial resection and laser ablation) have been developed with the purpose of removing the entire thickness of the endometrium. The benefits claimed for these therapies are reduced trauma and post-operative complications to the woman, reduced need for a general anaesthetic, direct cost savings to the health service due largely to a shift from inpatient to day case treatment and indirect cost savings to society as women return more quickly to their usual activities. However, endometrial hysteroscopic techniques are not always completely successful and additional surgical treatment is required in a proportion of cases. Although initially the resource and patient costs of these techniques are much cheaper than the cost of hysterectomy, the need for re treatment at a later stage may reduce the cost differential. Thus, the effectiveness of these techniques to improve a woman's perception of her own wellbeing long term has yet to be confirmed. The objective of this review is to compare endometrial destruction techniques with hysterectomy by any means for the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB). Electronic searches for relevant randomised controlled trials of the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Sub fertility Group Register of Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychLIT, Current Contents, Biological Abstracts, Social Sciences Index and CINAHL were performed. Attempts were also made to identify trials from citation lists of review articles and hand searching. In most cases, the first or corresponding author of each included trial was contacted for additional information. The inclusion criteria were randomised comparisons of endometrial destruction techniques with hysterectomy by any means for the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding in premenopausal women. Five RCTs were identified that fulfilled the inclusion criteria for this review. For two trials, a number of publications were identified which assessed different outcomes and different follow up time points for the same patients. The reviewers extracted the data independently and odds ratios for dichotomous outcomes and weighted mean differences for continuous outcomes were estimated from the data. Outcomes analysed included improvement in menstrual blood loss, satisfaction, change in quality of life, duration of surgery and hospital stay, time to return to work, adverse events and requirement for repeat surgery because of failure of the initial surgical treatment. There was a significant advantage in favour of hysterectomy in the improvement in HMB and satisfaction rates (up to 4 years post surgery) compared with endometrial destruction techniques. Although many quality of life scales reported no differences between surgery groups, there was some evidence of a greater improvement in general health for hysterectomy patients. Duration of surgery, hospital stay and recovery time were all shorter following endometrial destruction. Most adverse events, both major and minor, were significantly more likely after hysterectomy and before discharge from hospital. After discharge from hospital, the only difference that was reported for this group was a higher rate of infection. Repeat surgery because of failure of the initial treatment, either endometrial ablation or hysterectomy, was more likely after endometrial destruction than hysterectomy. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)","A Cochrane review of 5 RCTs that compared endometrial resection and ablation with hysterectomy for heavy menstrual bleeding reported a significant advantage for hysterectomy in symptom resolution and patient satisfaction. Although the initial cost was higher for the hysterectomy group, the difference narrowed over time because of the need for retreatment in the endometrial destruction group."
"What is the best treatment for gastroesophageal reflux and vomiting in infants
Nonpharmacological and nonsurgical measures are often recommended for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) in infants, despite ambiguous supporting evidence. To conduct a systematic review of rigorously evaluated nonpharmacological and nonsurgical therapies for GERD in infants. We searched online bibliographic databases, including MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Collaboration and Clinical Trials Database, and alternative medicine databases for the terms gastroesophageal reflux and infants. We selected randomized controlled trials of nonpharmacological and nonsurgical GERD therapies in otherwise healthy infants. Data were extracted from the selected articles regarding reflux, emetic episodes and intraesophageal pH. We identified 43 relevant studies, of which 10 met the selection criteria. These studies examined positioning, pacifier use, and feeding changes. Positioning at a 60 degree elevation in an infant seat was found to increase reflux compared with the prone position. No significant difference was shown between the flat and head-elevated prone positions. The impact of pacifier use on reflux frequency was equivocal and dependent on infant position. The protein content of formula was not found to affect reflux. Although no study demonstrated a significant reflux-reducing benefit of thickened infant foods compared with placebo, 1 study detected a significant benefit of formula thickened with carob bean gum compared with rice flour (pH<4 for 5% vs 8% of time). Another study showed that if supplementing with dextrose 5% water or dextrose 10% water, the lower-osmolality fluid was associated with less reflux. Many conservative measures commonly used to treat GERD in infants have no proven efficacy. Although thickened formulas do not appear to reduce measurable reflux, they may reduce vomiting. Further studies with clinical outcomes are needed to answer questions about efficacy definitively.","Three trials studied the effects of other conservative therapies such as positional changes and pacifiers on reflux measured by pH probe; unfortunately, none assessed clinical outcomes such as emesis or regurgitation. Reflux by pH probe was worsened in a trial studying the infant seat for positioning. In the trial studying elevating the head of the bed to 30Âº in the prone position, reflux measured by pH probe was also unchanged. The trial of pacifier use showed improvement of reflux by pH probe when used in the seated position, but worsening in the prone position. Since pH probe does not necessarily reflect clinical symptoms, the utility of the information from these studies is limited."
"How useful are autoantibodies in diagnosing thyroid disorders
NHANES III measured serum TSH, total serum T(4), antithyroperoxidase (TPOAb), and antithyroglobulin (TgAb) antibodies from a sample of 17,353 people aged > or =12 yr representing the geographic and ethnic distribution of the U.S. population. These data provide a reference for other studies of these analytes in the U.S. For the 16,533 people who did not report thyroid disease, goiter, or taking thyroid medications (disease-free population), we determined mean concentrations of TSH, T(4), TgAb, and TPOAb. A reference population of 13,344 people was selected from the disease-free population by excluding, in addition, those who were pregnant, taking androgens or estrogens, who had thyroid antibodies, or biochemical hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. The influence of demographics on TSH, T(4), and antibodies was examined. Hypothyroidism was found in 4.6% of the U.S. population (0.3% clinical and 4.3% subclinical) and hyperthyroidism in 1.3% (0.5% clinical and 0.7% subclinical). (Subclinical hypothyroidism is used in this paper to mean mild hypothyroidism, the term now preferred by the American Thyroid Association for the laboratory findings described.) For the disease-free population, mean serum TSH was 1.50 (95% confidence interval, 1.46-1.54) mIU/liter, was higher in females than males, and higher in white non-Hispanics (whites) [1.57 (1.52-1.62) mIU/liter] than black non-Hispanics (blacks) [1.18 (1.14-1.21) mIU/liter] (P < 0.001) or Mexican Americans [1.43 (1.40-1.46) mIU/liter] (P < 0.001). TgAb were positive in 10.4 +/- 0.5% and TPOAb, in 11.3 +/- 0.4%; positive antibodies were more prevalent in women than men, increased with age, and TPOAb were less prevalent in blacks (4.5 +/- 0.3%) than in whites (12.3 +/- 0.5%) (P < 0.001). TPOAb were significantly associated with hypo or hyperthyroidism, but TgAb were not. Using the reference population, geometric mean TSH was 1.40 +/- 0.02 mIU/liter and increased with age, and was significantly lower in blacks (1.18 +/- 0.02 mIU/liter) than whites (1.45 +/- 0.02 mIU/liter) (P < 0.001) and Mexican Americans (1.37 +/- 0.02 mIU/liter) (P < 0.001). Arithmetic mean total T(4) was 112.3 +/- 0.7 nmol/liter in the disease-free population and was consistently higher among Mexican Americans in all populations. In the reference population, mean total T(4) in Mexican Americans was (116.3 +/- 0.7 nmol/liter), significantly higher than whites (110.0 +/- 0.8 nmol/liter) or blacks (109.4 +/- 0.8 nmol/liter) (P < 0.0001). The difference persisted in all age groups. In summary, TSH and the prevalence of antithyroid antibodies are greater in females, increase with age, and are greater in whites and Mexican Americans than in blacks. TgAb alone in the absence of TPOAb is not significantly associated with thyroid disease. The lower prevalence of thyroid antibodies and lower TSH concentrations in blacks need more research to relate these findings to clinical status. A large proportion of the U.S. population unknowingly have laboratory evidence of thyroid disease, which supports the usefulness of screening for early detection.","A cross-sectional study (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey [NHANES III]) evaluated the presence of thyroid antibodies in 17,353 people representing the geographic and ethnic distribution of the United States, 95% of whom were categorized as free of thyroid disease. The study found that TPOAb was more sensitive than thyroglobulin for diagnosing nonspecific thyroid disease. The diagnosis of thyroid disease was based on abnormal thyroid-stimulating hormone and free T4 levels. Abnormally high levels of TPOAb had an LR+ of 4.3 and LR- of 0.6 (P<.0001) for thyroid disease, compared with an LR+ of 3.4 and LR- of 0.7 (P<.01) for abnormally elevated thyroglobulin."
"What is the best way to diagnose menopause
We measured serum reproductive hormone concentrations in a community-based, multiethnic population of premenopausal and early perimenopausal women to determine whether there are ethnic differences in hormones that can be explained by host factors. We studied 2930 participants in the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation who were aged 42-52 yr and self-identified as African-American (27.6%), Caucasian (47.1%), Chinese (7.4%), Hispanic (8.8%), or Japanese (9.0%) at 7 clinical sites. Outcome measures from this baseline assessment of a longitudinal study were serum estradiol (E2), FSH, testosterone (T), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, and SHBG concentrations and calculated estimates of free steroid availability, free testosterone index, and free E2 index from serum collected primarily in the early follicular phase of a spontaneous menstrual cycle. The primary explanatory variables were race/ethnicity, menopausal status, age, body mass index, day of the cycle, smoking, alcohol use, and physical activity. Chinese women had lower unadjusted E2 and SHBG levels, and Hispanic women had lower unadjusted T levels than other ethnic groups. Unadjusted serum FSH levels did not differ by race/ethnicity. E2 levels adjusted for host characteristics, particularly body size, did not differ by race/ethnicity. Adjusted FSH levels were higher, and adjusted T levels were lower in African-American and Hispanic women. Serum E2 and FSH concentrations were highly variable. Serum FSH levels, but no other hormone concentrations, were positively correlated with menopausal status. Serum dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate levels were negatively correlated with age, but not menopausal status. All hormone concentrations were significantly correlated with body mass index. We conclude that serum sex steroid, FSH, and SHBG levels vary by ethnicity, but are highly confounded by ethnic disparities in body size.",FSH levels are highly varied within individuals during perimenopause; and further variation due to body-mass index and ethnicity make defining diagnostic thresholds difficult.
"What are effective treatments for panic disorder
There is debate about combining benzodiazepines with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in the acute treatment of panic disorder. Although this medication combination is widely used in clinical practice, there is no well-tested, optimal method of coadministering these medications for the treatment of panic disorder. The purpose of this study was to test the efficacy of early coadministration of clonazepam with sertraline in the treatment of panic disorder. Fifty patients with panic disorder were randomized into a double-blind clinical trial. Patients received open-label sertraline for 12 weeks (target dose, 100 mg/d), and in addition were randomized to groups receiving either 0.5 mg of active clonazepam 3 times daily or placebo clonazepam for the first 4 weeks of the trial. The clonazepam dose was then tapered during 3 weeks and discontinued. Thirty-four (68%) of 50 patients completed the trial. Drop-out rates were similar in the sertraline/placebo vs the sertraline/clonazepam group (38% vs 25%) (P =.5). An intent-to-treat analysis (on last observation carried forward data) revealed a much greater proportion of responders in the sertraline/clonazepam compared with the sertraline/placebo group at the end of week 1 of the trial (41% vs 4%) (P =.003). There was also a significant between-group difference at the end of week 3 with 14 (63%) of 22 of the sertraline/clonazepam group responding to treatment vs 8 (32%) of 25 of the sertraline/placebo group (P =.05). This difference was not observed at other times during the trial. These data indicate that rapid stabilization of panic symptoms can be safely achieved with a sertraline/clonazepam combination, supporting the clinical utility of this type of regimen for facilitating early improvement of panic symptoms relative to sertraline alone.",Adding a BDZ to an SSRI for the first 3 weeks can rapidly stabilize symptoms.
"What's the best drug treatment for premature ejaculation
Seventeen male outpatients with premature ejaculation were randomly assigned to treatment with paroxetine (N = 8) or placebo (N = 9). After a first week dose of 20 mg/day, the paroxetine regimen was increased to 40 mg/day for 5 weeks. Patients and their female partners were interviewed separately. Patients treated with paroxetine had significantly greater clinical improvement than the patients given placebo.","In 1994, the first study of SSRIs in men with premature ejaculation demonstrated a delaying effect with paroxetine (Paxil)."
"Does digoxin decrease morbidity for those in sinus rhythm with heart failure
Digitalis glycosides have been in clinical use in the treatment of congestive heart failure (CHF) for more than 200 years. In recent years several trials have been conducted to address concerns about efficacy and toxicity. Although a systematic review of the literature was published in 1990, an update is required to include more current trials. To examine the effectiveness of digitalis glycosides in treating CHF in patients with normal sinus rhythm. To examine the effect of digitalis in patients taking diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and beta-blockers; patients with varying severity and duration of disease; patients with prior exposure to digitalis vs. no prior exposure; and patients with ""CHF due to systolic dysfunction"" vs. ""CHF with preserved systolic function."" The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) 2003 Issue 4, MEDLINE (1966 to December 2003) and EMBASE (1990 to December 2003) were searched. Dissertation Abstracts and annual meeting abstracts of the American Heart Association, American College of Cardiology, and European Society of Cardiology were also searched from 1996-2003. In addition, reference lists provided by the pharmaceutical industry (Glaxo Wellcome Inc.) were searched. Included were randomized placebo-controlled trials of 20 or more adult patients of either sex with symptomatic CHF who were studied for seven weeks or more. Excluded were trials in which the prevalence of atrial fibrillation was 2% or greater, or in which any arrhythmia that might compromise cardiac function or any potentially reversible cause of CHF such as acute ischemic heart disease or myocarditis was present. Articles selected from the searches described above were evaluated as a joint effort of the coauthors. The staff of the Cochrane Heart Group ran searches on the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Thirteen articles meeting the defined criteria were identified, and major endpoints of mortality, hospitalization, and clinical status, based respectively upon 8, 4, and 12 of these selected studies, were recorded and analyzed. The data show that there is no evidence of a difference in mortality between treatment and control groups, whereas digitalis therapy is associated with a lower rate of hospitalization and of clinical deterioration. The literature indicates that digitalis has a useful role in the treatment of patients with CHF who are in normal sinus rhythm.","A subgroup analysis of 988 patients with diastolic dysfunction (ejection fraction >45%) in this study3 suggested no clear benefits or harms when digoxin was used in combination with other therapies vs placebo; however, it did show a positive trend towards the combined outcome of reduced hospitalizations and less clinical deterioration (relative risk [RR]=0.82; 95% CI, 0.63-1.07)."
"How effective are dietary interventions in lowering lipids in adults with dyslipidemia
Convincing evidence shows that soy protein intake has beneficial effects on lipid changes, but it is unclear which components of soy protein are responsible. We conducted a meta-analysis to identify and quantify the effects of soy protein containing isoflavones on the lipid profile. Twenty-three eligible randomized controlled trials published from 1995 to 2002 were identified from the PUBMED database (National Library of Medicine, Bethesda, MD). Weighted mean effect sizes were calculated for net changes in serum lipid concentrations by using fixed-effect or random-effect models. Pre-specified subgroup analyses were performed to explore the influence of covariates on net lipid change. Soy protein with isoflavones intact was associated with significant decreases in serum total cholesterol (by 0.22 mmol/L, or 3.77%), LDL cholesterol (by 0.21 mmol/L, or 5.25%), and triacylglycerols (by 0.10 mmol/L, or 7.27%) and significant increases in serum HDL cholesterol (by 0.04 mmol/L, or 3.03%). The reductions in total and LDL cholesterol were larger in men than in women. Initial total cholesterol concentrations had a powerful effect on changes in total and HDL cholesterol, especially in subjects with hypercholesterolemia. Studies with intakes >80 mg showed better effects on the lipid profile. The strongest lowering effects of soy protein containing isoflavones on total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triacylglycerol occurred within the short initial period of intervention, whereas improvements in HDL cholesterol were only observed in studies of >12 wk duration. Tablets containing extracted soy isoflavones did not have a significant effect on total cholesterol reduction. Soy protein containing isoflavones significantly reduced serum total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triacylglycerol and significantly increased HDL cholesterol, but the changes were related to the level and duration of intake and the sex and initial serum lipid concentrations of the subjects.","A meta-analysis of 23 good-quality controlled trials with 1381 participants reported that soy protein with naturally occurring isoflavones significantly reduced total cholesterol, LDL, and triglycerides while significantly increasing HDL. The amount of soy isoflavone consumed varied across studies. One subgroup analysis showed that consumption of >80 mg/d was associated with a better effect on lipids. In subjects with baseline hypercholesterolemia (total cholesterol >240 mg/dL), greater reductions in total cholesterol, and greater increases in high density lipoprotein were reported, with comparable changes in low density lipoprotein and triglycerides."
"Should we screen women for hypothyroidism
The significance of mild hypercholesterolaemia in subclinical hypothyroidism and whether there is beneficial reduction after thyroxine replacement, remain controversial. We aimed to describe the association between hypercholesterolaemia and subclinical hypothyroidism, and to quantify the effect of thyroid substitution therapy by an analysis of previously published intervention studies. Intervention studies cited in the Medline database from January 1976 until January 1995, with index terms cholesterol, hypercholesterolaemia, hyperlipidaemia, thyrotrophin (TSH), hypothyroidism, thyroid and human. A total of 148 studies were reviewed. We recorded the year of publication, study design, number of patients enrolled, mean age, duration of thyroid substitution, normal range of TSH levels, TSH levels pre and post-substitution treatment and total cholesterol in plasma before and after treatment. (1) Qualitative description of studies on the relationship between hypercholesterolaemia and hypothyroidism, both subclinical and clinical. (2) Precision weighted pooled estimates of the effect of thyroid substitution therapy on the plasma levels of total cholesterol, in patients with subclinical and overt hypothyroidism. Subclinical hypothyroidism was two to three times more frequent in people with an elevated total plasma cholesterol. In addition, the total plasma cholesterol levels were slightly elevated in patients with subclinical dysfunction of the thyroid. Thyroid substitution therapy in patients with subclinical hypothyroidism, restoring the TSH levels to normal, decreased total cholesterol by 0.4 mmol/l (95% confidence interval (Cl) 0.2-0.6 mmol/l) independently of the initial plasma level. The effect of thyroid substitution therapy on HDL-cholesterol in patients with subclinical hypothyroidism was not consistent. The effect of thyroid substitution in patients with overt hypothyroidism was highly dependent on the pretreatment levels of total cholesterol. In these patients substitution therapy decreased total cholesterol by 1.2 mmol/l (95% Cl 0.9-1.5 mmol/l) when the plasma levels were elevated up to 8 mmol/l, and by 3.4 mmol/l (95% Cl 3.0-3.7) when plasma levels were higher than 8 mmol/l. The high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol level decreased and amounted to 0.16 mmol/l (95% Cl 0.07-0.24). Thyroid substitution treatment in patients with hypercholesterolaemia and subclinical hypothyroidism decreases total plasma cholesterol by 0.4 mmol/l, but plasma levels remain elevated in most patients. Further treatment with dietary restriction and cholesterol synthesis inhibitors should then be considered.",A meta-analysis with 278 hypothyroid patients given thyroid replacement found a reduction of total cholesterol (mean -15 mg/dL). low density lipoprotein effects were not reported. The clinical significance of lipid changes in these circumstances is unknown.
"What is the risk of bowel strangulation in an adult with an untreated inguinal hernia
Many men with inguinal hernia have minimal symptoms. Whether deferring surgical repair is a safe and acceptable option has not been assessed. To compare pain and the physical component score (PCS) of the Short Form-36 Version 2 survey at 2 years in men with minimally symptomatic inguinal hernias treated with watchful waiting or surgical repair. Randomized trial conducted January 1, 1999, through December 31, 2004, at 5 North American centers and enrolling 720 men (364 watchful waiting, 356 surgical repair) followed up for 2 to 4.5 years. Watchful-waiting patients were followed up at 6 months and annually and watched for hernia symptoms; repair patients received standard open tension-free repair and were followed up at 3 and 6 months and annually. Pain and discomfort interfering with usual activities at 2 years and change in PCS from baseline to 2 years. Secondary outcomes were complications, patient-reported pain, functional status, activity levels, and satisfaction with care. Primary intention-to-treat outcomes were similar at 2 years for watchful waiting vs surgical repair: pain limiting activities (5.1% vs 2.2%, respectively; P = .06 [corrected]); PCS (improvement over baseline, 0.29 points vs 0.13 points; P = .79). Twenty-three percent of patients assigned to watchful waiting crossed over to receive surgical repair (increase in hernia-related pain was the most common reason offered); 17% assigned to receive repair crossed over to watchful waiting. Self-reported pain in watchful-waiting patients crossing over improved after repair. Occurrence of postoperative hernia-related complications was similar in patients who received repair as assigned and in watchful-waiting patients who crossed over. One watchful-waiting patient (0.3%) experienced acute hernia incarceration without strangulation within 2 years; a second had acute incarceration with bowel obstruction at 4 years, with a frequency of 1.8/1000 patient-years inclusive of patients followed up for as long as 4.5 years. Watchful waiting is an acceptable option for men with minimally symptomatic inguinal hernias. Delaying surgical repair until symptoms increase is safe because acute hernia incarcerations occur rarely.Clinical Trials Registration ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00263250.","In a trial with 364 control group patients, median follow-up was only 3.2 years (maximum 4.5 years), and by 4 years 31% of patients had crossed over to the treatment group for elective repair."
"Which drugs are safest for moderate to severe depression in adolescents
The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued warnings that use of antidepressant medications poses a small but significantly increased risk of suicidal ideation/suicide attempt for children and adolescents. To assess the efficacy and risk of reported suicidal ideation/suicide attempt of antidepressants for treatment of pediatric major depressive disorder (MDD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and non-OCD anxiety disorders. PubMed (1988 to July 2006), relevant US and British regulatory agency reports, published abstracts of important scientific meetings (1998-2006), clinical trial registries, and information from authors. Studies were published and unpublished randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trials of second-generation antidepressants (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, nefazodone, venlafaxine, and mirtazapine) in participants younger than 19 years with MDD, OCD, or non-OCD anxiety disorders. Information was extracted on study characteristics, efficacy outcomes, and spontaneously reported suicidal ideation/suicide attempt. Twenty-seven trials of pediatric MDD (n = 15), OCD (n = 6), and non-OCD anxiety disorders (n = 6) were selected, and risk differences for response and for suicidal ideation/suicide attempt estimated by random-effects methods. Pooled risk differences in rates of primary study-defined measures of responder status significantly favored antidepressants for MDD (11.0%; [95% confidence interval {CI}, 7.1% to 14.9%]), OCD (19.8% [95% CI, 13.0% to 26.6%), and non-OCD anxiety disorders (37.1% [22.5% to 51.7%]), corresponding to a number needed to treat (NNT) of 10 (95% CI, 7 to 15), 6 (4 to 8), and 3 (2 to 5), respectively. While there was increased risk difference of suicidal ideation/suicide attempt across all trials and indications for drug vs placebo (0.7%; 95% CI, 0.1% to 1.3%) (number needed to harm, 143 [95% CI, 77 to 1000]), the pooled risk differences within each indication were not statistically significant: 0.9% (95% CI, -0.1% to 1.9%) for MDD, 0.5% (-1.2% to 2.2%) for OCD, and 0.7% (-0.4% to 1.8%) for non-OCD anxiety disorders. There were no completed suicides. Age-stratified analyses showed that for children younger than 12 years with MDD, only fluoxetine showed benefit over placebo. In MDD trials, efficacy was moderated by age, duration of depression, and number of sites in the treatment trial. Relative to placebo, antidepressants are efficacious for pediatric MDD, OCD, and non-OCD anxiety disorders, although the effects are strongest in non-OCD anxiety disorders, intermediate in OCD, and more modest in MDD. Benefits of antidepressants appear to be much greater than risks from suicidal ideation/suicide attempt across indications, although comparison of benefit to risk varies as a function of indication, age, chronicity, and study conditions.",One analysis estimated the difference in risk to be 1.6-fold with a 95% CI of 1.0-2.7 (3% vs 2%; NNH=112).
"History, exam, and labs: Is one enough to diagnose acute adult appendicitis
The importance of specific elements in the clinical diagnosis of appendicitis is controversial. This review analyses the diagnostic value of elements of disease history, clinical findings and laboratory test results in suspected appendicitis. A systematic Medline search was made of all published studies on the clinical and laboratory diagnosis of appendicitis in patients admitted to hospital with suspected disease. Meta-analyses of receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) areas, and positive and negative likelihood ratios, of 28 diagnostic variables described in 24 studies are presented. Inflammatory response variables (granulocyte count, proportion of polymorphonuclear blood cells, white blood cell count and C-reactive protein concentration), descriptors of peritoneal irritation (rebound and percussion tenderness, guarding and rigidity) and migration of pain were the strongest discriminators, with ROC areas of 0.78 to 0.68. The discriminatory power of the inflammatory variables was particularly strong for perforated appendicitis, with ROC areas of 0.85 to 0.87. Appendicitis was likely when two or more inflammatory variables were increased and unlikely when all were normal. Although all clinical and laboratory variables are weak discriminators individually, they achieve a high discriminatory power when combined. Laboratory examination of the inflammatory response, clinical descriptors of peritoneal irritation, and a history of migration of pain yield the most important diagnostic information and should be included in any diagnostic assessment.","A meta-analysis of patients hospitalized for suspected acute appendicitis analyzed 28 different diagnostic variables in 24 studies. Variables included WBC, granulocyte count, PMN proportion, c-reactive protein level, and body temperature; histopathology was the gold standard. In no circumstance did an isolated elevation of any 1 factor result in a significant LR+. In addition, the absence of any 1 variable failed to yield a LR- <0.01 (low enough to exclude appendicitis)."
"What is the initial work-up in the diagnosis of hypertension
It is uncertain whether left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) confers an increased risk for cerebrovascular disease in apparently healthy patients with essential hypertension. A total of 2363 initially untreated hypertensive patients (mean age 51+/-12 years, 47% women) free of previous cardiovascular disease were followed up for up to 14 years (mean 5 years). At entry, all patients underwent diagnostic tests, including ECG, echocardiography, and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring. At entry, the prevalence of LVH was 17.6% by ECG (Perugia score) and 23.7% by echocardiography (LVM >125 g/m(2)). Over the subsequent years, 105 patients experienced a first stroke or transient ischemic attack. The cerebrovascular event rate was higher among patients with LVH at entry, diagnosed by either ECG or echocardiography, than among those without hypertrophy (both P<0.01). After control for the significant influence of age, sex, diabetes, and 24-hour mean ambulatory BP, LVH by ECG conferred an increased risk for cerebrovascular events (relative risk [RR] 1.79; 95% CI 1.17 to 2.76). LVH by echocardiography also conferred a higher risk for cerebrovascular events (RR 1.64; 95% CI 1.07 to 2.68). For each increase in LV mass of 1 SD (29 g/m(2)), there was a significant independent increase in the risk for cerebrovascular events (RR 1.31; 95% CI 1.09 to 1.58). In apparently healthy patients with essential hypertension, LVH diagnosed by ECG or echocardiography confers an excess risk for stroke and transient ischemic attack independently of BP and other individual risk factors.","A cohort study followed 2363 patients for 14 years who had untreated hypertension and were without pre-existing cardiovascular disease. After controlling for age, sex, diabetes, and mean blood pressure, LVH by electrocardiogram conferred a significant increased risk for cerebrovascular events (relative risk=1.79; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.17-2.76). However, in a cohort of 4684 subjects from the Framingham Heart Study, electrocardiogram had a sensitivity of only 6.9% for the detection of LVH (specificity 98.8%; positive likelihood ratio=5.3; negative likelihood ratio=0.94)."
"Should we use appetite stimulants for malnourished elderly patients
Weight loss among older patients is a severe problem, associated with an increased incidence of infections, decubiti, and death. Megestrol acetate (MA) causes weight gain in cachectic cancer and AIDS patients, but its effects in older cachectic patients are unknown. To compare the effects of MA oral suspension (O.S.), 800 mg/day, versus placebo on weight in geriatric nursing home patients with weight loss or low body weight. Twelve-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with a 13-week follow-up period. Veterans Administration Medical Center (VMAC) nursing home. Nursing home patients with weight loss of > or =5% of usual body weight over the past 3 months, or body weight 20% below their ideal body weight. Patients were randomly assigned to receive placebo or MA 800 mg/day for 12 weeks and were then followed for 13 weeks off treatment. Primary outcome was measured by weight and appetite change. Secondary outcome measures included sense of well-being, enjoyment of life, change in depression scale, laboratory nutrition parameters, energy intake counts, body composition, and adverse events. At 12 weeks there were no significant differences in weight gain between treatment groups, whereas MA-treated patients reported significantly greater improvement in appetite, enjoyment of life, and well-being. Body composition was not statistically different between the two groups. At Week 25 (3 months after treatment), 61.9% of MA-treated patients had gained > or =1.82 kg (4 lbs) compared to 21.7% of placebo patients. In geriatric patients with weight loss or low body weight MA improves appetite and well-being after 12 weeks of treatment. During the 3 months of MA treatment, there was no statistically significant weight gain (> or =4 lbs). Three months after treatment, weight gain (> or =4 lbs) was significantly increased in MA-treated patients.","In contrast, an earlier Veterans Administration (and predominantly male) study showed 13/21 of those treated with megestrol (800 mg daily for 12 weeks) noted weight gain (â‰¥4 lb sustained at 3 months post-treatment), compared with 5/23 of those receiving placebo (number needed to treat [NNT]=2.5).2 Of note, only 9/26 patients had sustained weight gain in the megestrol group at the 12-month endpoint post-treatment, comparable with 7/25 in the placebo group. Some small, but statistically significant, score improvements were noted during the treatment period in appetite and enjoyment of life; however, no differences were noted in scores on the more widely accepted Geriatric Depression Scale."
"Do allergy shots help seasonal allergies more than antihistamines and nasal steroids
The efficacy and side effects of two approaches to the treatment of ragweed pollen-induced rhinoconjunctivitis were compared in a double-blind, parallel-group trial. Sixty ragweed-sensitive adults were randomized either to a course of four Pollinex-R hyposensitization injections during the 6 weeks before the ragweed-pollen season, or to budesonide aqueous nasal steroid spray, 400 micrograms daily, throughout the season. A double-dummy technique was used to achieve blinding. During the ragweed-pollen season, troublesome nasal symptoms were treated with terfenadine, 60 mg, when treatment was needed, up to 240 mg daily, and eye symptoms were treated with naphazoline eye drops, when treatment was needed, up to four times daily. Every day, subjects recorded the severity of nasal and eye symptoms and medication use in a diary. Fourteen of the subjects receiving Pollinex-R were unable to complete the course of injections because of systemic or large local reactions. Eight subjects withdrew during the pollen season because of severe rhinitis; all subjects had received Pollinex-R. Subjects in the budesonide-treated group had minimal nasal symptoms and used very little terfenadine, compared with subjects in the Pollinex-R-treated group (p less than 0.0001). Eye symptoms and eye drop use were similar in the two treatment groups. No clinically important side effects were reported by the subjects receiving budesonide. The results of this study suggest that aqueous budesonide nasal spray is markedly more effective than Pollinex-R in controlling symptoms of seasonal rhinitis while the side effects and inconvenience of immunotherapy are avoided.",One study reported that inhaled nasal steroid therapy was superior to a nonstandard immunotherapy for ragweed pollen-induced rhinitis.
"How effective is gastric bypass for weight loss
Obesity is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Several observational epidemiological studies have indicated that weight gain and weight loss, even in the obese, is also related to an increased mortality. The Swedish Obese Subjects (SOS) study was initiated in 1987 as an attempt to elucidate this paradox. Two thousand matched patient pairs will be followed for 10 y each. One pair member is surgically treated, while the other receives conventional obesity treatment. By February 2000, 1879 patient pairs have been recruited. The two-y weight reduction was 28+/-15 kg among the operated patients and 0.5+/-8.9 kg among the obese controls. After eight years the weight loss was 20+/-16 kg in the surgical group, while the controls had gained 0.7+/-12 kg. Weight reductions achieved in the surgical group reduced the two-y incidence of diabetes 32 times as compared to the controls. After eight years there was still a 5-fold reduction in diabetes incidence. The two-y incidence of hypertension was similarly reduced 2.6 times in the surgical group. After eight years the incidence of hypertension was almost equal in the two study groups. Compared to weight stability, large intentional weight loss results in substantial reductions in the two-y incidence of several cardiovascular risk factors. After eight years there is still a reduced risk of developing diabetes in the surgical group, while the incidence of hypertension is equal in the two treatment groups. Whether intentional weight loss will reduce mortality is still too early to tell.","Bariatric surgery, including gastric bypass, has significant postoperative morbidity and mortality. Thirteen percent of patients in the Swedish Obesity Study experienced peri-operative complications, including pulmonary symptoms (6.2%), abdominal infection (2.1%), wound complications (1.8%), bleeding (0.9%), thromboembolic events (0.8%), and other miscellaneous complications (4.8%). Postoperative complications required reoperation for 2.2% of surgical patients, and there were 4 postoperative deaths (0.2% of the operative patients; 3 due to leakage, and 1 due to a technical laparoscopic error)."
"For fibromyalgia, which treatments are the most effective
Fibromyalgia is a common, poorly understood musculoskeletal pain syndrome with limited therapeutic options. To systematically review the efficacy of antidepressants in the treatment of fibromyalgia and examine whether this effect was independent of depression. Meta-analysis of English-language, randomized, placebo-controlled trials. Studies were obtained from searching MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PSYCLIT (1966-1999), the Cochrane Library, unpublished literature, and bibliographies. We performed independent duplicate review of each study for both inclusion and data extraction. Sixteen randomized, placebo-controlled trials were identified, of which 13 were appropriate for data extraction. There were 3 classes of antidepressants evaluated: tricyclics (9 trials), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (3 trials), and S-adenosylmethionine (2 trials). Overall, the quality of the studies was good (mean score 5.6, scale 0-8). The odds ratio for improvement with therapy was 4.2 (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 2.6 to 6.8). The pooled risk difference for these studies was 0.25 (95% CI, 0.16 to 0.34), which calculates to 4 (95% CI, 2.9 to 6.3) individuals needing treatment for 1 patient to experience symptom improvement. When the effect on individual symptoms was combined, antidepressants improved sleep, fatigue, pain, and well-being, but not trigger points. In the 5 studies where there was adequate assessment for an effect independent of depression, only 1 study found a correlation between symptom improvement and depression scores. Outcomes were not affected by class of agent or quality score using meta-regression. Antidepressants are efficacious in treating many of the symptoms of fibromyalgia. Patients were more than 4 times as likely to report overall improvement, and reported moderate reductions in individual symptoms, particularly pain. Whether this effect is independent of depression needs further study.","Evidence supporting the effectiveness of TCAs is strong, especially amitriptyline, in fibromyalgia-related symptoms. A metaanalysis that included 10 trials of low-dose TCAs (eg, 25-50 mg of amitriptyline) showed moderate improvement in sleep, pain, fatigue, and overall well-being (number needed to treat [NNT] for improvement=4)."
"What treatments work best for constipation in children
Twenty-one children under 15-years' old with chronic constipation were treated in a crossover trial lasting 3 weeks. In the first week they received either lactulose or senna, in the next week no treatment, and in the third week the alternative treatment. Patient diaries were kept by parents on the number and character of stools passed, and of side-effects reported, during the 3 weeks. There was a significant difference, in favour of lactulose, in the number of days on which normal stools were passed during the treatment weeks. The number and frequency of the side-effects reported in the senna treatment week were very much higher (p less than 0.001) than in the lactulose week. Lactulose is recommended as an effective and very well tolerated treatment for the constipated child.","One poor-quality randomized controlled trials found that senna was less effective than lactulose and had more side effects (colicky pain, diarrhea)."
"When is it OK for children to start drinking fruit juice
The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recently issued recommendations for 100% fruit juice consumption for children and adolescents. National survey data (1994-1996, 1998 Continuing Survey of Food Intakes by Individuals) were used to evaluate intake of 100% fruit juice for comparison with AAP recommendations. Mean daily intakes of 100% fruit juice were 0.9, 4.6, and 3.4 ounces in children aged <6 months, 6 months-6 years, and 7-18 years, respectively, which fall within AAP recommendations for these age groups. At age 5, mean intake of fruit drinks and ades exceeded that of 100% fruit juice (P=.009). Carbonated soft drink intake exceeded that of 100% fruit juice at age 5 and of milk at age 13 (P<.04). By age 13, adolescents drank more carbonated soft drinks than 100% fruit juice, milk, or fruit drinks and ades. Increased consumption of nutrient-dense beverages (100% fruit juice, milk) and water as part of a varied diet should be encouraged.","Sugar-sweetened beverages (labeled as fruit drinks) often replace whole fruits in childhood diets. As a result, children may fail to meet recommendations for intake of whole fruits and vegetables, which contain fiber and nutrients essential to growth."
"Should you evaluate for coronary artery disease in seniors with premature ventricular contractions
Exercise-induced ventricular ectopy predicts an increased risk of death in population-based cohorts. We sought to examine in a clinical cohort the prognostic importance of ventricular ectopy immediately after exercise, when reactivation of parasympathetic activity occurs. We hypothesized that ventricular ectopy after exercise (i.e., during the recovery phase) would predict an increased risk of death better than ventricular ectopy during exercise. We studied 29,244 patients (mean [+/-SD] age, 56+/-11 years; 70 percent men) who had been referred for symptom-limited exercise testing without a history of heart failure, valve disease, or arrhythmia. Frequent ventricular ectopy was defined by the presence of seven or more ventricular premature beats per minute, ventricular bigeminy or trigeminy, ventricular couplets or triplets, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular flutter, torsade de pointes, or ventricular fibrillation. Frequent ventricular ectopy occurred only during exercise in 945 patients (3 percent), only during recovery in 589 (2 percent), and during both exercise and recovery in 491 (2 percent). There were 1862 deaths during a mean of 5.3 years of follow-up. Frequent ventricular ectopy during exercise predicted an increased risk of death (five-year death rate, 9 percent, vs. 5 percent among patients without frequent ventricular ectopy during exercise; hazard ratio, 1.8; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.5 to 2.1; P<0.001), but frequent ventricular ectopy during recovery was a stronger predictor (11 percent vs. 5 percent; hazard ratio, 2.4; 95 percent confidence interval, 2.0 to 2.9; P<0.001). After propensity matching for confounding variables, frequent ventricular ectopy during recovery predicted an increased risk of death (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.5; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.1 to 1.9; P=0.003), but frequent ventricular ectopy during exercise did not (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.1; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.9 to 1.3; P=0.53). Frequent ventricular ectopy during recovery after exercise is a better predictor of an increased risk of death than ventricular ectopy occurring only during exercise.","A large prospective cohort study followed more than 29,000 patients with varying degrees of risk for 5 years. After adjusting for confounding variables, frequent PVCs (â‰¥7 per minute or more complex ventricular ectopy) during recovery predicted an increased risk of death (HR=1.5; 95% CI, 1.1-1.9). Frequent PVCs arising during exercise stress testing were not associated with increased risk."
"What interventions can help patients stop using chewing tobacco
Use of smokeless tobacco (ST) can lead to nicotine addiction and health problems including periodontal disease and oral cancer To assess the effects of behavioural and pharmacotherapeutic interventions to treat ST use. We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group trials register (February 2004), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2004), MEDLINE (January 1966-February 2004), EMBASE (1988-January 2004), CINAHL (1982-February 2004), PsycINFO (1984-February 2004), Database of Abstract of Reviews of Effectiveness (DARE, The Cochrane Library, Issue 1, 2004). Randomized trials of behavioural or pharmacological interventions to help users of ST to quit, with follow-up of at least six months. Two authors independently extracted data. One trial of bupropion did not detect a benefit of treatment after six months (Odds Ratio (OR) 1.00, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.23 to 4.37). Three trials of nicotine patch did not detect a benefit (OR 1.16, 95% CI: 0.88 to 1.54), nor did two trials of nicotine gum (OR 0.98, 95% CI: 0.59 to 1.63). There was statistical heterogeneity among the results of eight trials of behavioural interventions included in the meta-analysis. Three trials showed significant benefits of intervention. In a post-hoc analysis the trials of interventions which included an oral examination and feedback about ST-induced mucosal changes had homogeneous results and when pooled showed a significant benefit (OR 2.41 95% CI: 1.79 to 3.24). Behavioural interventions should be used to help ST users to quit. Pharmacotherapies have not been shown to affect long-term abstinence but larger trials are needed.","In a meta-analysis, one small randomized trial of bupropionfound no effect on tobacco abstention (OR=1.00; 95% CI, 0.23-4.37)."
"Do inhaled steroids increase the risk of osteoporosis
Inhaled glucocorticosteroids (ICS) are commonly prescribed for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. No adverse effect on bone mineral density (BMD) has been proven. In a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial at seven centers in North America, we recruited 412 current smokers or recent quitters with mild to moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. They used inhaled triamcinolone acetonide, 600 mcg, or placebo, twice daily. We measured femoral neck and lumbar spine BMD at baseline and after 1 and 3 years, and serum osteocalcin at baseline, 3 months, 1 year, and 3 years. After 3 years, BMD at the femoral neck decreased 1.78% more with ICS than with placebo (p < 0.001). More participants in the ICS group experienced 6% or more loss of femoral neck BMD (p = 0.002). Lumbar spine BMD increased in the placebo group by 0.98% but decreased by 0.35% in the ICS group (a difference of 1.33%, p = 0.007). Changes in osteocalcin did not correlate with changes in BMD. Fractures, lost height, or osteoporosis diagnoses were not increased among ICS users compared with placebo users. In summary, the use of inhaled triamcinolone acetonide was associated with loss of BMD at the femoral neck and lumbar spine after 3 years of treatment.","There is some evidence that higher doses of inhaled corticosteroids can result in adverse bone mineral density changes. In a high-quality randomized controlled trials of 412 participants, aged 40 to 69 years, with mild to moderate COPD, use of higher-dose triamcinolone (1200 mcg/day) was associated with decreased lumbar and femoral neck bone mineral density over 3 to 4 years. The differences in bone mineral density between the inhaled corticosteroids and placebo groups at the femoral neck and lumbar spine were 1.78% (P<.001) and 1.33% (P=.007), respectively. However, the risk of fracture or height loss did not increase at follow-up."
"Which drugs are safest for moderate to severe depression in adolescents
Depressive disorders are common in young people and are associated with significant negative impacts. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are often used, however, evidence of their effectiveness in children and adolescents is not clear. Furthermore, there have been warnings against their use in this population due to concerns about increased risk of suicidal ideation and behaviour. To determine the efficacy and adverse outcomes, including definitive suicidal behaviour and suicidal ideation, of SSRIs compared to placebo in the treatment of depressive disorders in children and adolescents. We searched the CCDAN Trials Register, MEDLINE, PSYCHINFO and CENTRAL. Reference lists were checked, letters were sent to key researchers and internet databases searched. We included published and unpublished randomised controlled trials. Two or three review authors selected the trials, assessed the quality and extracted trial and outcome data. We used a fixed-effect meta-analysis. The relative risk was used to summarise dichotomous outcomes and the mean difference to summarise continuous measures. Twelve trials were eligible for inclusion, with ten providing usable data. At 8-12 weeks, there was evidence that children and adolescents 'responded' to treatment with SSRIs (RR 1.28, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.41). There was also evidence of an increased risk of suicidal ideation and behaviour for those prescribed SSRIs (RR 1.80, 95% CI 1.19 to 2.72). Fluoxetine was the only SSRI where there was consistent evidence from three trials that it was effective in reducing depression symptoms in both children and adolescents (CDRS-R treatment effect -5.63, 95% CI -7.38 to -3.88), and 'response' to treatment (RR 1.86, 95% CI 1.49 to 2.32). Where rates of adverse events were reported, this was higher for those prescribed SSRIs. Caution is required to interpret the results. First, there were methodological issues, including high attrition, issues regarding measurement instruments and clinical usefulness of outcomes, often variously defined across trials. Second, patients seen in clinical practice are likely to be more unwell, and at greater risk of suicide, compared to those in the trials, and it is unclear how this group would respond to SSRIs. This needs to be considered, along with the evidence of an increased risk of suicide related outcomes in those treated with SSRIs. It is unclear what the effect of SSRIs is on suicide completion. While untreated depression is associated with the risk of completed suicide and impacts on functioning, it is unclear whether SSRIs would modify this risk in a clinically meaningful way.","A recent Cochrane review confirmed the increase in absolute risk (1.8; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.19-2.72)."
"Do allergy shots help seasonal allergies more than antihistamines and nasal steroids
Allergic rhinitis affects about 20% of the US population. The diagnosis is based on patterns of symptoms, physical examination, and assessment of IgE antibodies by skin or in vitro testing. The most common offending allergens are pollens of grasses, trees, and weeds; fungi; animal allergens; and dust mites. In an individual with nasal allergy, exposure leads to rapid release of mast cell-derived mediators. This immediate response is followed by a cell-dominated response, including eosinophils and lymphocytes. Cytokines from T(H)2 lymphocytes, such as interleukin 4 and interleukin 5, orchestrate allergic inflammation. Resulting tissue changes produce symptoms of the disease and augment responses on subsequent exposure to allergens and irritants. Strategies for avoiding offending agents are important in management. In intermittent disease, antihistamines and/or decongestants are first prescribed. More continuous symptoms may mandate intranasal steroids. Immunotherapy is often helpful for patients who respond poorly to pharmacotherapy and avoidance.","In standard practice, immunotherapy is not recommended for most patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis unless avoidance measures and symptomatic therapy are ineffective, have adverse effects, or are not feasible."
"What are the most effective ways you can help patients stop smoking
Use of nicotine-replacement therapies and the antidepressant bupropion helps people stop smoking. We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled comparison of sustained-release bupropion (244 subjects), a nicotine patch (244 subjects), bupropion and a nicotine patch (245 subjects), and placebo (160 subjects) for smoking cessation. Smokers with clinical depression were excluded. Treatment consisted of nine weeks of bupropion (150 mg a day for the first three days, and then 150 mg twice daily) or placebo, as well as eight weeks of nicotine-patch therapy (21 mg per day during weeks 2 through 7, 14 mg per day during week 8, and 7 mg per day during week 9) or placebo. The target day for quitting smoking was usually day 8. The abstinence rates at 12 months were 15.6 percent in the placebo group, as compared with 16.4 percent in the nicotine-patch group, 30.3 percent in the bupropion group (P<0.001), and 35.5 percent in the group given bupropion and the nicotine patch (P<0.001). By week 7, subjects in the placebo group had gained an average of 2.1 kg, as compared with a gain of 1.6 kg in the nicotine-patch group, a gain of 1.7 kg in the bupropion group, and a gain of 1.1 kg in the combined-treatment group (P<0.05). Weight gain at seven weeks was significantly less in the combined-treatment group than in the bupropion group and the placebo group (P<0.05 for both comparisons). A total of 311 subjects (34.8 percent) discontinued one or both medications. Seventy-nine subjects stopped treatment because of adverse events: 6 in the placebo group (3.8 percent), 16 in the nicotine-patch group (6.6 percent), 29 in the bupropion group (11.9 percent), and 28 in the combined-treatment group (11.4 percent). The most common adverse events were insomnia and headache. Treatment with sustained-release bupropion alone or in combination with a nicotine patch resulted in significantly higher long-term rates of smoking cessation than use of either the nicotine patch alone or placebo. Abstinence rates were higher with combination therapy than with bupropion alone, but the difference was not statistically significant.","A large double-blind, placebo controlled trial compared the relative efficacy of sustained-release bupropion (n=244), nicotine patch (n=244), bupropion plus nicotine patch (n=245), and placebo (n=160). At 1 year, the bupropion groups had higher self-reported point-prevalence abstinence rates (abstinence during the previous 7 days) than the placebo and nicotine-patch-alone groups (bupropion 30%, placebo 16%, nicotine-patch-alone 16%; absolute risk reduction [ARR]=0.14, NNT=7, P<.001). Continuous abstinence (abstinence from quit date) was also higher for the bupropion groups compared with placebo (bupropion 18%, placebo 6%; ARR=0.12; NNT=8; P<.001). Adding nicotine replacement to bupropion therapy increased 1-year smoking cessation rates by 5% over bupropion alone but was not statistically significant."
"Should we screen adults for asymptomatic microhematuria
A cohort of 501 workers in a steel mill in Ontario, Canada was followed up from 1974 to 1986 for 13 years. Results indicate that the 13-year cumulative incidence of urological diseases among workers who had a positive urinalysis result of microscopic haematuria at the beginning of the follow-up period (1974) was 1.3 times that of those who had a negative urinalysis result (95% confidence interval 0.6-2.8). This relative risk remained the same after adjusting for age and smoking. This indicates that there is a possibility that urinary screening for microscopic haematuria could be a useful predictor of urological disease occurrence. However, the benefits of early detection and management were difficult to demonstrate. Serious urological diseases, particularly urinary cancers, were not detected earlier as a result of the urinary screening test in this study. Several studies have been done to validate the test in the past. More work to validate the test and to determine the predictive accuracy is recommended.","A retrospective cohort study assessed the prevalence of urologic disease in patients with asymptomatic microhematuria compared with those without. Of 501 male steel-workers-an occupation believed to have a higher risk for urologic malignancy-57 men had urologic disease of any type. Six men with urolog-ic disease had asymptomatic microhematuria, while 51 men with urologic disease did not. The correlation between asymptomatic microhema-turia and the presence of urologic disease was not significant (P>.05). There were 3 cases of urolog-ic cancer in the study, all diagnosed in men without asymptomatic microhematuria."
"What is the best treatment for plantar fasciitis
A randomized, prospective study was conducted to compare the effectiveness of three individual mechanical modalities in the treatment of plantar fasciitis. Two hundred fifty-five subjects were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups: custom-made orthoses, over-the-counter arch supports, or tension night splints. Subjects were treated for 3 months, with follow-up visits at 2, 6, and 12 weeks. No statistically significant difference was noted among treatment groups with respect to final outcomes based on first-step pain or pain felt during the day. However, there was a statistically significant difference among the three groups with respect to early patient withdrawal from the study due to continued severe pain, noncompliance, or inability to tolerate the device. Patient compliance was greatest with the use of custom-made orthoses.","A prospective, observer-blinded study randomized 116 patients to 1 of 2 groups for 3 months. The first group of patients were treated with a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (piroxicam) and Achilles tendon stretching 3 times a day. The second group received the same treatment but also wore plastic tension night splints in 5Âº of dorsiflexion. After 3 months, in an intention-to-treat analysis, no statistically significant difference was detected in subjective pain between the 2 groups. In this study, patient compliance with the tension night splinting was poor, and this likely affected the outcome."
"How accurate is stress radionuclide imaging for diagnosis of coronary artery disease
To determine the discriminant accuracy of exercise thallium-201 myocardial perfusion scintigraphy for the diagnosis and prognosis of patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease. A survey of the National Library of Medicine MEDLINE database. The key medical subject headings used were coronary disease, myocardial infarction, radionuclide imaging, and thallium. A total of 122 retrieved studies were considered relevant and were reviewed in depth. Only studies reporting both the sensitivity and specificity of thallium scintigraphy were analyzed. Discriminant accuracy for diagnosis and prognosis was summarized in terms of pooled sensitivity and specificity. Exercise thallium scintigraphy is useful in the noninvasive diagnosis of coronary artery disease, especially in patients with abnormal resting electrocardiograms, restricted exercise tolerance, and intermediate probability of having disease at the time of testing as well as of defining the prognosis of patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease, especially in those with previous myocardial infarction. Because of various shortcomings in the published record, however, the marginal discriminant accuracy and cost effectiveness of thallium scintigraphy compared with conventional clinical assessment and exercise electrocardiography remain controversial.",A systematic review reported estimates of sensitivity ranging from 68% to 96% and specificity from 65% to 100%.
"What is the addiction risk associated with tramadol
Tramadol has been marketed in the US since 1995. The US Food and Drug Administration agreed to release tramadol as a non-scheduled drug if proactive post-marketing surveillance studies would be conducted. This study was one of two phase IV protocols that were part of the overall surveillance program. It focused on impaired health professionals who are a high risk/high access population for drug abuse. All active participants in four state monitoring programs between November 1, 1995 and August 15, 1998 (n = 1,601) were recruited for the study. With the exceptions of implementing a standardized intake interview and urine testing for tramadol metabolites, all states operated their programs in the usual fashion. The programs were alerted to persistent non-prescribed tramadol use so that appropriate interventions could be employed. Despite availability of tramadol and the conditions that might lead to its abuse, the incidence rate for tramadol use in the study population was only 69 per thousand persons per year and the incidence rate for tramadol abuse or dependence was 6.9 per thousand persons per year.","A 3-year post-marketing cohort study measured tramadol's nonmedical misuse rates using urine drug testing for tramadol among 1601 participants in 4 US state monitoring programs for impaired healthcare professionals. Tramadol exposure occurred in 140 (8.7%) participants. Thirty-nine (28%) were classified as extensive experimentation or abuse of tramadol. Overall, the rate of extensive experimentation or abuse was 18 cases per thousand personyears. The Hawthorne effect, where awareness of being monitored alters a subject's behavior, may threaten these measured frequency rates' generalizability."
"What is the best therapy for superficial thrombophlebitis
Until present time, suggested treatments for superficial thrombophlebitis induced by intravenous infusion (TFSI), are of uncertain effectiveness and most of them or empirical and not fully researched. The aim of this report is to study the effectiveness and safety of the topical and oral administration of diclofenac in the treatment of TFSI. In this prospective study 120 patients both female and male were included. All of them developed TFSI during hospitalization and at the same time they were assigned at random to one of the following groups: G-control (n = 40), without treatment; G-topical (n = 40), diclofenac emulsion gel used in a topical way on the concerned area every 8 hours during 48 hours; G-oral (n = 40), diclofenac 75 mg p.o. every 12 hours during 48 hours. The measurements were done at the moment of diagnosis of TFSI (T0) and 48 hours later (T2). Registries of intensity of TFSI were done by quantifying flushing, tumor, heatness and pain. These data were compared considering the averages of differences registered in T2 with respect to T0. A decrease of intensity of TFSI > or = 30% was considered a positive answer to this treatment. The quantitative variables were studied with ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis test or general linear model and the qualitative with the chi 2 test with Yates correction. The level of significance used was alpha = 0.05. The averages of differences in the intensity of TFSI that were registered in the groups G-control, G-topical and G-oral in T2 compared to T0 are: -0.12 (4.89), -5.70 (3.13), -4.82 (3.14) (p = 0.000). The favorable answers in G-control, G-topical and G-oral were: 20, 60 and 60%, respectively (p = 0.0001). The adverse reactions in G-topical and G-oral were: headache 9-5 (p = 0.2), epigastric pain 4-17 (p = 0.0009), nausea 6-16 (p = 0.01) and local pruritus 5-2 (p = 0.2). The treatment did not report serious adverse reactions in either of the groups. The topical treatment of diclofenac can be recommended as an alternative simple, effective and safe therapy for patients who develop TFSI.","For infusion-related SVTP, a randomized controlled trial of 120 patients found both oral and topical diclofenac effective in reducing symptoms (NNT=3), although oral diclofenac had significantly more gastrointestinal side effects (number needed to harm=3 for dyspepsia)."
"Should you test or treat partners of patients with gonorrhea, chlamydia, or trichomoniasis
Traditional partner referral for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) is ineffective at assuring that partners are treated. Alternative methods are needed. We sought to determine whether patient-delivered partner treatment (PDPT) is better than 2 different methods of partner referral in providing antibiotic treatment to sex partners of men with urethritis and in reducing recurrence of Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Men who received a diagnosis of urethritis at a public STD clinic in New Orleans, Louisiana, during the period of December 2001 through March 2004 were randomly assigned according to the month of treatment for either standard partner referral (PR), booklet-enhanced partner referral (BEPR), or PDPT. At baseline and after 1 month, men were asked to provide information about each partner and were tested for C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae. Most enrolled index men (n = 977) were > 24 years of age (51.6%) and African American (95%) and had > or = 2 partners (68.3%). They reported information on 1991 partners, and 78.8% were reinterviewed 4-8 weeks later. Men in the PDPT arm were more likely than men in the BEPR and PR arms to report having seen their partners, having talked to their partners about the infection, having given the intervention to their partners, and having been told by their partners that the antibiotic treatment had been taken (55.8%, 45.6%, and 35.0%, respectively; P < .001). Of men who were reinterviewed, 37.5% agreed to follow-up testing for N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis infection. Those tested were similar to those not tested with regard to the study variables measured. Among those tested, men in the PDPT and BEPR arms were less likely than those in the PR arm to test positive for C. trachomatis and/or N. gonorrhoeae (23.0%, 14.3%, and 42.7%, respectively; P < .001). Among heterosexual men with urethritis, PDPT was better than standard partner referral for treatment of partners and prevention of recurrence of C. trachomatis or N. gonorrhoeae infection.",1 cohort study showed a statistically significant decrease in recurrent or persistent chlamydial infection in index patients.
"What is the most effective treatment for tinea pedis athlete's foot
Superficial fungal infections affect millions of people throughout the world. Among them, tinea represents cutaneous infections by dermatophytes. Therapeutic strategies depend upon the affected body site. Hence, clinicians distinguish several types of tinea including the corporis, faciei, cruris, pedis, manuum, capitis, barbae and unguium variants. There are several ways of tackling the tinea problem. Numerous topical and oral antifungals are available today. Topical antifungals remain the most commonly recommended treatment for many superficial dermatophytoses. Active compounds include imidazoles, morpholines and allylamines, with a few other miscellaneous drugs. The recent development of new generation oral agents (fluconazole, itraconazole, terbinafine) has enhanced the armamentarium against difficult-to-treat tineas. The antifungal efficacy and pharmacokinetic profiles of these drugs allow shorter durations of treatment and the innovative use of intermittent pulse regimens. The modern formulations fully meet the requirements of being well tolerated, involving little risk and acting specifically against relevant pathogens. However, the response rates to date do not always come up to the high expectations offered by in vitro studies.","Griseofulvin has been used for more than 30 years, is well tolerated, and efficacious in treating dermatomycoses in the range of 60%. Ketoconazole's cure rate is similar, but its use in cutaneous infections is limited by multiple drug interactions and serious side effects."
"Do patients at high risk of Alzheimer's disease benefit from early treatment
Mild cognitive impairment is a transitional state between the cognitive changes of normal aging and early Alzheimer's disease. In a double-blind study, we evaluated subjects with the amnestic subtype of mild cognitive impairment. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive 2000 IU of vitamin E daily, 10 mg of donepezil daily, or placebo for three years. The primary outcome was clinically possible or probable Alzheimer's disease; secondary outcomes were cognition and function. A total of 769 subjects were enrolled, and possible or probable Alzheimer's disease developed in 212. The overall rate of progression from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease was 16 percent per year. As compared with the placebo group, there were no significant differences in the probability of progression to Alzheimer's disease in the vitamin E group (hazard ratio, 1.02; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.74 to 1.41; P=0.91) or the donepezil group (hazard ratio, 0.80; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.57 to 1.13; P=0.42) during the three years of treatment. Prespecified analyses of the treatment effects at 6-month intervals showed that as compared with the placebo group, the donepezil group had a reduced likelihood of progression to Alzheimer's disease during the first 12 months of the study (P=0.04), a finding supported by the secondary outcome measures. Among carriers of one or more apolipoprotein E epsilon4 alleles, the benefit of donepezil was evident throughout the three-year follow-up. There were no significant differences in the rate of progression to Alzheimer's disease between the vitamin E and placebo groups at any point, either among all patients or among apolipoprotein E epsilon4 carriers. Vitamin E had no benefit in patients with mild cognitive impairment. Although donepezil therapy was associated with a lower rate of progression to Alzheimer's disease during the first 12 months of treatment, the rate of progression to Alzheimer's disease after three years was not lower among patients treated with donepezil than among those given placebo.","An randomized controlled trials of donepezil showed initial cognitive improvement in mild cognitive impairment patients. However, the only trial carried out for 3 years showed no persistent benefit at that time."
"How should thyroid replacement be initiated
In 84 patients, aged 23 to 84, with primary hypothyroidism, the daily dose of thyroxine needed to lower the serum thyrotropin level into the normal range was significantly less in older patients than in younger ones (p less than 0.01). Most of the difference between middle-aged (40 to 60 years) and older patients (greater than 60 years) was due to a decrease in the required dose in men; there was no difference in the dose needed by women in these age groups. Previous hyperthyroidism did not affect the dose of thyroxine required; it is unlikely that residual autonomous thyroid tissue affected the dose. Although the wide range of doses needed precludes use of these data in calculating a dose of thyroxine for an individual patient, doses of 100 micrograms per day or less were common in patients over age 40, and a few patients over age 60 needed 50 micrograms per day or less. Thus, (1) there is a sound physiologic basis for the common practice of using low doses of thyroxine, e.g., 25 micrograms per day, as initial therapy in older hypothyroid patients and (2) it may be reasonable to reassess the dose of thyroxine after several years in older patients.","An uncontrolled cohort study of 84 patients found that for patients aged >60 years, 25- to 50-Âµg doses of LT4 resulted in similar serum thyrotropin (TSH) levels as the higher (1.6 Âµg/kg/d) doses required for younger patients."
"Does stimulant therapy help adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
Our objective was to compare the efficacy of the new wake-promoting drug modafinil to that of dextroamphetamine for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adults. Twenty-two adults who met DSM-IV criteria for ADHD participated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, three-phase crossover study comparing placebo, modafinil, and dextroamphetamine for the treatment of ADHD. The twice-daily study medications were titrated to doses of optimum efficacy over 4-7 days and then held constant during the rest of each 2-week treatment phase. Measures of improvement included the DSM-IV ADHD Behavior Checklist for Adults, the Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWAT, using the letters C, F, and L version), Stroop, and Digit Span (Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale version). For the 21 (96%) completers, the mean (+/- SD) optimum doses of modafinil and dextroamphetamine were 206.8 mg/day +/- 84.9 and 21.8 mg/day +/- 8.9, respectively. Scores on the DSM-IV ADHD Checklist (p < 0.001) were significantly improved over the placebo condition following treatment with both active medications. Performance on the COWAT (p < 0.05) reached trend levels of significance. Both medications were generally well tolerated. This preliminary study suggests that modafinil may be a viable alternative to conventional stimulants for the treatment of adults with ADHD.","A good study was a randomized, double-blind, 3-phase crossover study of dextroamphetamine, modafinil (a drug used to treat narcolepsy), and placebo. Each phase was 2 weeks long, with a 4-day washout in between. A favorable response was defined as a reduction of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder symptoms by at least 30% on the DSM-IV attention deficit hyperactivity disorder Behavior Checklist for Adults. Dextroamphetamine and modafinil showed the same response rate in 10 of 21 patients. Both treatments had a significant improvement over placebo (P<.001). It was unclear from the study what percentage of subjects responded to placebo."
"Do OTC remedies relieve cough in acute URIs
Acute cough due to upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) is a common symptom. Non-prescription over-the-counter (OTC) medicines are frequently recommended as a first-line treatment, but there is little evidence as to whether these drugs are effective. To assess the effects of oral OTC cough preparations for acute cough. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2006, Issue 4); MEDLINE (January 1966 to January Week 1, 2007); EMBASE (January 1974 to January 2007); and the UK Department of Health National Research Register (June 2007). Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing oral OTC cough preparations with placebo in children and adults suffering from acute cough in ambulatory settings. We considered all cough outcomes and second outcomes of interest were adverse effects. Two review authors independently screened potentially relevant citations and independently extracted data and assessed study quality. Quantitative analysis was performed where appropriate. Twenty five trials (17 in adults, 8 in children) involving 3492 people (2876 adults and 616 children) were included. RESULTS OF STUDIES IN ADULTS: Six trials compared antitussives with placebo and had variable results. Two trials compared the expectorant, guaifenesin with placebo, one indicated significant benefit whereas the other did not. One trial found that a mucolytic reduced cough frequency and symptom scores. Two studies examined antihistamine-decongestant combinations and found conflicting results. Three studies compared other combinations of drugs with placebo and indicated some benefit in reducing cough symptoms. Three trials found antihistamines were no more effective than placebo in relieving cough symptoms. RESULTS OF STUDIES IN CHILDREN: Antitussives (two studies), antihistamines (two studies), antihistamine decongestants (two studies) and antitussive/bronchodilator combinations (one study) were no more effective than placebo. No studies using expectorants met our inclusion criteria. The results of one trial favoured active treatment with mucolytics over placebo. One trial tested two paediatric cough syrups and both preparations showed a 'satisfactory response' in 46% and 56% of children compared to 21% of children in the placebo group. There is no good evidence for or against the effectiveness of OTC medicines in acute cough. The results of this review have to be interpreted with caution due differences in study characteristics and quality. Studies often showed conflicting results with uncertainty regarding clinical relevance. Higher quality evidence is needed to determine the effectiveness of self-care treatments for acute cough.",DM was no more effective than placebo for decreasing cough in 2 RCTs enrolling a total of 107 children. Another single-blinded randomized controlled trials of 100 children showed that neither DM nor diphenhydramine relieved cough better than placebo.
"What is the best medical therapy for new-onset type 2 diabetes
Care of patients with type 2 diabetes has been revolutionized throughout the past several years-first, by the realization of the importance of tight glycemic control in forestalling complications, and second, by the availability of several unique classes of oral antidiabetic agents. Deciphering which agent to use in certain clinical situations is a new dilemma facing the primary care physician. To systematically review available data from the literature regarding the efficacy of oral antidiabetic agents, both as monotherapy and in combination. A MEDLINE search was performed to identify all English-language reports of unique, randomized controlled clinical trials involving recently available oral agents for type 2 diabetes. Bibliographies were also reviewed to find additional reports not otherwise identified. Studies (63) were included in the analysis if they had a study period of at least 3 months; if each group contained at least 10 subjects at the study's conclusion; and if hemoglobin A(1c) was reported. When multiple dosages of a drug were tested, the results of the highest approved dosage were used. In placebo-controlled trials, hemoglobin A(1c) data are presented as the difference between the change in treated vs placebo subjects. Five distinct oral drug classes are now available for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Compared with placebo treatment, most of these agents lower hemoglobin A(1c) levels approximately 1% to 2%. Equivalent efficacy is usually demonstrated when different agents are compared with one another in the same study population. When they are used in combination, there are additional glycemic benefits. Long-term vascular risk reduction has been demonstrated only with sulfonylureas and metformin. With few exceptions, the available oral antidiabetic agents are equally effective at lowering glucose concentrations. Their mechanisms of action are different, however, and as a result they appear to have distinct metabolic effects. These are reflected in their adverse effect profiles and their effect on cardiovascular risk, which may influence drug choice.","A systematic review with 31 placebo-controlled randomized trials (total n=12,185 patients) evaluated changes in HbA1c with monotherapy using 5 different classes of oral agents. Except for the Î‘-glucosidase inhibitor acarbose (Precose), which was less effective, all agents typically reduced HbA1c by 1% to 2%. However, in an additional 19 out of 23 randomized head-to-head studies (total n=5396) included in the same systematic review, all classes showed equal efficacy."
"What behavioral interventions are safe and effective for treating obesity
Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is the most comprehensive means of medically treating obesity, but only few data have so far been published concerning its long-term effectiveness. We here report our experience of 1068 consecutive patients (868 females) treated with CBT at a university-based obesity centre. The patients were enrolled into three different programmes: a 14-week LEARN programme (672 patients), a 16-week MOB programme for the morbidly obese (259 patients), or a 20-week BINGE programme for subjects affected by binge eating (137 patients). Eighty-five percent of the subjects completed the weekly programmes. The percentage of patients attending the scheduled control visits during the 1-year follow-up gradually decreased, being very low in the BINGE group (10%). The percentage weight loss was an average of 6% during the weekly courses, being higher in the MOB programme; by the end of the weekly sessions, it exceeded 10% of initial body weight in 22% of cases and increased to 36% during the follow-up. The cumulative probability of follow-up was higher among the patients undergoing the MOB and LEARN programmes than among the BINGE patients (p < 0.0001), and decreased with the increasing severity of obesity. Female gender and a weight loss of > 10% i.b.w. increased compliance to follow-up. The study further demonstrates the difficulty of achieving compliance to chronic management of obesity and the critical role of binge eating disorder in the medium-term treatment of obesity. Strategies are needed to improve adherence to a follow-up protocol.","Initial weight loss-ie, weight loss in the first few months of the behavioral intervention-was a good predictor of long-term adherence to behavioral interventions."
"Does antepartum perineal massage reduce intrapartum lacerations
Perineal trauma following vaginal birth can be associated with significant short- and long-term morbidity. Antenatal perineal massage has been proposed as one method of decreasing the incidence of perineal trauma. To assess the effect of antenatal perineal massage on the incidence of perineal trauma at birth and subsequent morbidity. We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group Trials Register (30 January 2005), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library, Issue 1, 2005), PubMed (1966 to January 2005), EMBASE (1980 to January 2005) and reference lists of relevant articles. Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials evaluating any described method of antenatal perineal massage undertaken for at least the last four weeks of pregnancy. Both review authors independently applied the selection criteria, extracted data from the included studies and assessed study quality. We contacted study authors for additional information. Three trials (2434 women) comparing digital perineal massage with control were included. All were of good quality. Antenatal perineal massage was associated with an overall reduction in the incidence of trauma requiring suturing (three trials, 2417 women, relative risk (RR) 0.91 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.86 to 0.96), number needed to treat (NNT) 16 (10 to 39)). This reduction was statistically significant for women without previous vaginal birth only (three trials, 1925 women, RR 0.90 (95% CI 0.84 to 0.96), NNT 14 (9 to 35)). Women who practised perineal massage were less likely to have an episiotomy (three trials, 2417 women, RR 0.85 (95% CI 0.75 to 0.97), NNT 23 (13 to 111)). Again this reduction was statistically significant for women without previous vaginal birth only (three trials, 1925 women, RR 0.85 (95% CI 0.74 to 0.97), NNT 20 (11 to 110)). No differences were seen in the incidence of 1st or 2nd degree perineal tears or 3rd/4th degree perineal trauma. Only women who have previously birthed vaginally reported a statistically significant reduction in the incidence of pain at three months postpartum (one trial, 376 women, RR 0.68 (95% CI 0.50 to 0.91) NNT 13 (7 to 60)). No significant differences were observed in the incidence of instrumental deliveries, sexual satisfaction, or incontinence of urine, faeces or flatus for any women who practised perineal massage compared with those who did not massage. Antenatal perineal massage reduces the likelihood of perineal trauma (mainly episiotomies) and the reporting of ongoing perineal pain and is generally well accepted by women. As such, women should be made aware of the likely benefit of perineal massage and provided with information on how to massage.","A systematic review evaluating whether antepartum perineal massage reduced perineal trauma included 3 RCTs with a total of 1941 primagravidas and 493 multigravidas. Women were randomized to receive either instruction in perineal massage or no instruction. Massage reduced perineal trauma requiring suturing by 10% among primigravid patients, compared with controls (relative risk [RR]=0.90; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.84-0.96; number needed to treat [NNT]=14). Subgroup analysis revealed an inverse relationship between reduced trauma and frequency of massage: Primagravidas who massaged fewer than 1.5 times a week showed a 17% reduction (RR=0.83; 95% CI, 0.75-0.92; NNT=9), compared with an 8% reduction for women who massaged 1.5 to 3.4 times a week (RR=0.92; 95% CI, 0.85-1.00; NNT=22) and a statistically insignificant 7% reduction for the group that massaged more than 3.5 times a week (RR=0.93; 95% CI, 0.86-1.02). Perineal massage reduced the incidence of episiotomy by 15% among primigravidas compared with controls (RR=0.85; 95% CI, 0.74-0.97; NNT=20); the largest reduction occurred in primagravidas who massaged as often as 1.5 times per week (RR=0.72; 95% CI, 0.57-0.91). This effect was not seen in primagravidas who massaged more often. Multigravid patients did not experience a statistically significant reduction in episiotomy. Perineal massage did not affect the overall incidence of first- and second-degree perineal lacerations (first-degree laceration: RR=0.95; 95% CI, 0.78-1.16; second-degree laceration: RR=0.98; 95% CI, 0.84-1.15), nor the incidence of third- or fourth-degree lacerations (RR=0.81; 95% CI, 0.56-1.15). No difference was noted in the incidence of instrument delivery (RR=0.94; 95% CI, 0.81-1.08)."
"What are the most effective ways you can help patients stop smoking
Treating Tobacco Use and Dependence, a Public Health Service-sponsored Clinical Practice Guideline, is a product of the Tobacco Use and Dependence Guideline Panel (""the panel""), consortium representatives, consultants, and staff. These 30 individuals were charged with the responsibility of identifying effective, experimentally validated tobacco dependence treatments and practices. The updated guideline was sponsored by a consortium of seven Federal Government and nonprofit organizations: the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Cancer Institute (NCI), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institute on Drug Abuse, Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, and University of Wisconsin Medical School's Center for Tobacco Research and Intervention. This guideline is an updated version of the 1996 Smoking Cessation Clinical Practice Guideline No. 18 that was sponsored by the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (now the AHRQ), United States Department of Health and Human Services. The original guideline reflected the extant scientific research literature published between 1975 and 1994. The updated guideline was written because new, effective clinical treatments for tobacco dependence have been identified since 1994. The accelerating pace of tobacco research that prompted the update is reflected in the fact that 3,000 articles on tobacco were identified as published between 1975 and 1994, contributing to the original guideline. Another 3,000 were published between 1995 and 1999 and contributed to the updated guideline. These 6,000 articles were screened and reviewed to identify a much smaller group of articles that served as the basis for guideline data analyses and panel opinion. This guideline contains strategies and recommendations designed to assist clinicians, tobacco dependence treatment specialists, and health care administrators, insurers, and purchasers in delivering and supporting effective treatments for tobacco use and dependence. The recommendations were made as a result of a systematic review and analysis of the extant scientific literature, using meta-analysis as the primary analytic technique. The strength of evidence that served as the basis for each recommendation is clearly indicated in the guideline. A draft of the guideline was peer-reviewed prior to publication, and the comments of 70 external reviewers were incorporated into the final document. The key recommendations of the updated guideline, Treating Tobacco Use and Dependence, based on the literature review and expert panel opinion, are as follows: 1. Tobacco dependence is a chronic condition that often requires repeated intervention. However, effective treatments exist that can produce long-term or even permanent abstinence. 2. Because effective tobacco dependence treatments are available, every patient who uses tobacco should be offered at least one of these treatments: Patients willing to try to quit tobacco use should be provided with treatments identified as effective in this guideline. Patients unwilling to try to quit tobacco use should be provided with a brief intervention designed to increase their motivation to quit. 3. It is essential that clinicians and health care delivery systems (including administrators, insurers, and purchasers) institutionalize the consistent identification, documentation, and treatment of every tobacco user seen in a health care setting. 4. Brief tobacco dependence treatment is effective, and every patient who uses tobacco should be offered at least brief treatment. 5. There is a strong dose-response relation between the intensity of tobacco dependence counseling and its effectiveness. Treatments involving person-to-person contact (via individual, group, or proactive telephone counseling) are consistently effective, and their effectiveness increases with treatment intensity (eg, minutes of contact). 6. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)",Good evidence suggests that physician-administered smoking cessation counseling lasting less than 3 minutes improves quit rates.
"What is the diagnostic approach to a 1-year-old with chronic cough
Chronic cough is an important, sometimes frustrating problem, often encountered by the otolaryngologist-head and neck surgeon. Thirty-eight infants and children under age 16 with a normal chest roentgenogram were evaluated for chronic cough persisting for longer than 4 weeks. Specific therapy (rather than symptomatic treatment) of chronic cough lead to a resolution or control of the cough in 33 (87%). Cough-variant asthma was by far the most common cause of chronic cough, followed by sinusitis, aberrant innominate artery, psychogenic cough, and subglottic stenosis. In addition to a detailed history, physical examination, and chest roentgenogram, endoscopy, paranasal sinus roentgenograms, and pulmonary function studies with methacholine challenge testing were particularly effective for establishing a precise diagnosis. Chronic cough is best managed by determining the precise cause of the cough, then specifically treating the underlying disorder. Children with persistent cough and a normal chest roentgenogram should be referred promptly for evaluation by an otolaryngologist when the primary physician's initial efforts at diagnosis and treatment are unsuccessful. Endoscopy is under-utilized in practice and its importance is understated in the literature. It is particularly helpful in establishing a precise diagnosis in infants under 18 months of age.","If the initial evaluation is not revealing, further investigation should focus on congenital anomalies, asthma, postnasal drip, and GERD. Aberrant innominate artery and asthma were the most frequent diagnoses among children aged <18 months old referred for otolaryngology consultation."
"Which late-stage Alzheimer's patients should be referred for hospice care
Survival varies for patients with advanced dementia, and accurate prognostic tools have not been developed. A small proportion of patients admitted to hospice have dementia, in part because of the difficulty in predicting survival. To identify factors associated with 6-month mortality in newly admitted nursing home residents with advanced dementia and to create a practical risk score to predict 6-month mortality in this population. This was a retrospective cohort study of data from the Minimum Data Set (MDS). All Medicare or Medicaid licensed nursing homes in New York and Michigan were included. Participants had advanced dementia and were admitted to New York nursing homes between June 1, 1994, and December 30, 1998 (derivation cohort, n = 6799), and to Michigan nursing homes from October 1, 1998, through July 30, 2000 (validation cohort, n = 4631). MDS factors associated with 6-month mortality were determined in the derivation group, and the resulting mortality risk score was evaluated in the validation cohort. Risk score performance was compared with the cut point of 7c on the Functional Assessment Staging (FAST) scale. Among residents with advanced dementia, 28.3% (n = 1922) died within 6 months of nursing home admission in the derivation cohort; 35.1% (n = 1626) died in the validation cohort. The 6-month mortality rate increased across risk scores (possible range, 0-19): 0 points, 8.9% mortality; 1 to 2, 10.8%; 3 to 5, 23.2%; 6 to 8, 40.4%; 9 to 11, 57.0%; and at least 12, 70.0% in the validation cohort. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve for predicting 6-month mortality was 0.74 and 0.70 in the derivation and validation cohorts, respectively. Our risk score demonstrated better discrimination to predict 6-month mortality (AUROC, 0.64 for a cutoff of > or =6 points vs 0.51 for FAST stage 7c). A risk score based on 12 variables from the MDS estimates 6-month mortality for nursing home residents with advanced dementia with greater accuracy than existing prognostic guidelines.","In a retrospective cohort study of 11,430 nursing home residents with advanced dementia (defined as a score of 5 or 6 on the Cognitive Performance Score, which is itself based on MDS data, a prognostic summary score was developed using 12 variables from the MDS, a federally mandated assessment completed by nursing home staff at the time of admission. A high score predicted 6-month mortality more accurately than using an MDS correlate of FAST stage 7c. In the derivation cohort (n=6799), 28.3% (n=1922) died within 6 months; in the validation cohort (n=4631), 35.1% (n=1626) died within 6 months. The FAST 7c correlate was found to have a positive predictive value of only 38.5% and a sensitivity of 22% in predicting death within 6 months in this population. In contrast, using the MDS variables, a higher threshold for the prognostic summary score resulted in a positive predictive value of 80%, negative predictive value of 73%, specificity of 99%, but sensitivity of only 6%. A lower cutoff yielded better sensitivity (23%), and still had good specificity (96%) and negative predictive value (76%), though the positive predictive value was slightly lower (67%).

"What interventions reduce the risk of contrast nephropathy for high-risk patients
The administration of radiographic contrast agents remains an important cause of acute renal failure. The optimal infusion for hydration has not been evaluated. To compare the incidence of contrast media-associated nephrotoxicity with isotonic or half-isotonic hydration. Prospective, randomized, controlled, open-label study. Patients scheduled for elective or emergency coronary angioplasty were randomly assigned to receive isotonic (0.9% saline) or half-isotonic (0.45% sodium chloride plus 5% glucose) hydration beginning the morning of the procedure for elective interventions and immediately before emergency interventions. An increase in serum creatinine of at least 0.5 mg/dL (44 micromol/L) within 48 hours was defined as contrast media-associated nephrotoxicity. Secondary end points were cardiac and peripheral vascular complications. A total of 1620 patients were assigned to receive isotonic (n = 809) or half-isotonic (n = 811) hydration. Primary end point analysis was possible in 1383 patients. Baseline characteristics were well matched. Contrast media-associated nephropathy was significantly reduced with isotonic (0.7%, 95% confidence interval, 0.1%-1.4%) vs half-isotonic (2.0%, 95% confidence interval, 1.0%-3.1%) hydration (P =.04). Three predefined subgroups benefited in particular from isotonic hydration: women, persons with diabetes, and patients receiving 250 mL or more of contrast. The incidence of cardiac (isotonic, 5.3% vs half-isotonic, 6.4%; P =.59) and peripheral vascular (isotonic, 1.6% vs half-isotonic, 1.5%, P =.93) complications was similar between the 2 hydration groups. Isotonic hydration is superior to half-isotonic hydration in the prevention of contrast media-associated nephropathy.",An randomized controlled trials showed that periprocedural hydration with isotonic saline is superior to half-normal saline in preventing contrast nephropathy (NNT=77).
"Should you test or treat partners of patients with gonorrhea, chlamydia, or trichomoniasis
Many sex partners of persons with gonorrhea or chlamydial infections are not treated, which leads to frequent reinfections and further transmission. We randomly assigned women and heterosexual men with gonorrhea or chlamydial infection to have their partners receive expedited treatment or standard referral. Patients in the expedited-treatment group were offered medication to give to their sex partners, or if they preferred, study staff members contacted partners and provided them with medication without a clinical examination. Patients assigned to standard partner referral were advised to refer their partners for treatment and were offered assistance notifying partners. The primary outcome was persistent or recurrent gonorrhea or chlamydial infection in patients 3 to 19 weeks after treatment. Persistent or recurrent gonorrhea or chlamydial infection occurred in 121 of 931 patients (13 percent) assigned to standard partner referral and 92 of 929 (10 percent) assigned to expedited treatment of sexual partners (relative risk, 0.76; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.59 to 0.98). Expedited treatment was more effective than standard referral of partners in reducing persistent or recurrent infection among patients with gonorrhea (3 percent vs. 11 percent, P=0.01) than in those with chlamydial infection (11 percent vs. 13 percent, P=0.17) (P=0.05 for the comparison of treatment effects) and remained independently associated with a reduced risk of persistent or recurrent infection after adjustment for other predictors of infection at follow-up (relative risk, 0.75; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.57 to 0.97). Patients assigned to expedited treatment of sexual partners were significantly more likely than those assigned to standard referral of partners to report that all of their partners were treated and significantly less likely to report having sex with an untreated partner. Expedited treatment of sex partners reduces the rates of persistent or recurrent gonorrhea or chlamydial infection.","An randomized controlled trials showed a decrease in recurrent or persistent chlamydial infection in the index patient, but the difference did not reach statistical significance."
"When should a child with an undescended testis be referred to a urologist
We assessed the fertility of 40 patients who underwent orchiopexy between 1950 and 1960. Testicular biopsies also had been performed at operation, a practice exceptional for the era. Of 23 patients with unilateral undescended testes who attempted to have children 20 (87 per cent) were successful. In contrast, only 3 (33 per cent) of 9 patients with bilateral undescended testes fathered children. Over-all sperm counts in 16 patients were low but they were not predictive of paternity. Testicular biopsy specimens were reviewed and the fertility index was determined. In most cases a good correlation was found between histological status and paternity status.","A retrospective cohort study found 87% successful paternity after orchiopexy for 24 patients with unilateral undescended testis and 33% success for 9 with bilateral undescended testes but there was no normal control group. The boys were aged 1 to 14 years (mean, 7 years) at surgery, and there was no relationship between timing of orchiopexy and paternity success."
"Should we screen women for hypothyroidism
Subclinical hypothyroidism (sHT) affects 5-15% of the general population; however, the need of lifelong L-T(4) therapy is still controversial. As myocardium is a main target of thyroid hormone action, we investigated whether sHT induces cardiovascular alterations. Twenty sHT patients were randomly assigned to receive placebo or L-T(4) therapy and were followed for 1 yr. Twenty sex- and age-matched normal subjects served as controls. Doppler echocardiography and videodensitometric analysis were performed in all subjects. Myocardium textural parameters were obtained as mean gray levels, which were then used to calculate the cyclic variation index (CVI; percent systolic/diastolic change in mean gray levels). Patients had a significantly higher isovolumic relaxation time (3.1 +/- 0.5 vs. 2.6 +/- 0.6; P < 0.03), peak A (0.77 +/- 0.16 vs. 0.56 +/- 0.13 m/s; P < 0.01), and preejection/ejection time (PEP/ET) ratio (0.72 +/- 0.05 vs. 0.57 +/- 0.06; P < 0.03) and a lower CVI (P < 0.0001) than controls. CVI was inversely related to TSH level (P < 0.0001) and PEP/ET ratio (P < 0.01). L-T(4)-treated patients showed a significant reduction of the PEP/ET ratio (P < 0.05), peak A (P < 0.05), and isovolumic relaxation time (P < 0.05) along with a normalization of CVI. Conversely, no changes were observed in the placebo-treated group. In conclusion, sHT affects both myocardial structure and contractility. These alterations may be reversed by L-T(4) therapy.",A randomized controlled trial of 20 people with subclinical hypothyroidism found significantly improved left ventricular function assessed by echocardiography after 6 months of treatment with levothyroxine vs placebo.
"Which technique for removing nevi is least scarring
Shave excision is a simple and quick procedure that is widely used for removal of benign naevi. Limited published data are available on patient acceptability of this procedure or its potential cosmetic outcomes. To assess the patient's satisfaction with the procedure, to assess the risk of recurrence, and to determine the patient's perception of the scar. Questionnaires were sent to 93 consecutive patients who had shave excision of benign facial naevi. Seventy-six patients (82%) with a total of 83 naevi responded. Twenty-eight percent of naevi were reported to have recurred 12 months after shave excision. A significantly higher recurrence rate was found with hairy naevi (41%, P= 0.04). More than half of the patients reported no scar or had a white and flat scar. Nineteen percent of scars were depressed, and 15% were raised; 7% were pigmented. The majority of patients were satisfied with the results. Despite a high recurrence rate, most patients were satisfied with the cosmetic outcomes after shave excision of benign facial naevi. The results of this study have helped us to provide our patients with more accurate information regarding cosmetic outcomes.","Researchers conducting a second retrospective study, done at least 1 year after the procedure, used a questionnaire to ask 76 patients (with a total of 83 nevi removed from the face by shave excision) about their perceptions of the scar. Patients described their lesions as: no scar (33%), white and flat (25%), depressed (19%), raised (15%), and pigmented (7%). Eighty-six percent thought their scars looked better than the nevus and 79% were ""happy with the way the scar looks now.""."
"Which complementary therapies can help patients with PMS
Reduced magnesium (Mg) levels have been reported in women affected by premenstrual syndrome (PMS). To evaluate the effects of an oral Mg preparation on premenstrual symptoms, we studied, by a double-blind, randomized design, 32 women (24-39 years old) with PMS confirmed by the Moos Menstrual Distress Questionnaire. After 2 months of baseline recording, the subjects were randomly assigned to placebo or Mg for two cycles. In the next two cycles, both groups received Mg. Magnesium pyrrolidone carboxylic acid (360 mg Mg) or placebo was administered three times a day, from the 15th day of the menstrual cycle to the onset of menstrual flow. Blood samples for Mg measurement were drawn premenstrually, during the baseline period, and in the second and fourth months of treatment. The Menstrual Distress Questionnaire score of the cluster ""pain"" was significantly reduced during the second month in both groups, whereas Mg treatment significantly affected both the total Menstrual Distress Questionnaire score and the cluster ""negative affect."" In the second month, the women assigned to treatment showed a significant increase in Mg in lymphocytes and polymorphonuclear cells, whereas no changes were observed in plasma and erythrocytes. These data indicate that Mg supplementation could represent an effective treatment of premenstrual symptoms related to mood changes.",A randomized controlled trials comparing magnesium with placebo had low precision because of small numbers and short treatment duration. The study (N=28) demonstrated reduced total Moos Menstrual Distress Questionnaire scores.
"Should patients with acute deep venous thrombosis limit activity
To investigate the effect of compression and immediate ambulation in the acute stage of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) on the development of postthrombotic syndrome (PTS). Design: follow-up study of patients who previously have been enrolled in a randomized controlled trial. Setting: outpatient department of a municipial hospital. Subjects and interventions: a follow-up was performed 2 years after 53 patients with acute proximal DVT had been enrolled into a randomized controlled trial, comparing bed rest and no compression (n=17), Unna boot bandages plus walking (n=18) and compression stockings plus walking (n=18). Telephone interviews could be conducted with 11 patients, 37 patients could be reinvestigated by independent observers (11 from the bed-rest group, 13 from the bandage group and 13 from the stocking group). Compression stockings up to the time of the follow-up were worn by 8/11 (73%) of the bed-rest patients and by 13/26 (50%) of the mobile patients. Main outcome measures: clinical and venous duplex investigation, pain assessment using visual analogue scale and Lowenberg test, leg circumference, clinical ''PTS-score'' combining 5 subjective symptoms with 6 objective signs (Villalta-Prandoni-scale). Duplex investigation of the deep veins and pain assessment by visual analogue scale showed no significant differences between the groups. Nine out of 11 patients after bed rest, but only 16/26 in the mobile groups showed a larger calf circumference on the diseased leg (n.s.). Judged by the Villalta-Prandoni-scale a significantly better outcome could be found in the mobile group (mean score 5.1) than in the bed-rest group (mean score 8.2), (p<0.01). (''Mild PTS'' = score 5-14, ''severe PTS'' score = or > 15). Eighteen out of 26 mobile patients, but only 2/11 bed-rest patients had a score = or < 5 (''no PTS''). Immediate mobilisation with compression in the acute stage of DVT reduces the incidence and the severity of PTS.",A prospective cohort study of new PE in patients treated with ambulation and compression plus anticoagulation found that the incidence of PE was significantly lower than historical incidence rates in patients managed with bed rest.
"What are effective medication combinations for dyslipidemia
Colesevelam hydrochloride is a novel, potent, non-absorbed lipid-lowering agent previously shown to reduce low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. To examine the efficacy and safety of coadministration of colesevelam and atorvastatin, administration of these agents alone or in combination was examined in a double-blind study of 94 hypercholesterolemic men and women (baseline LDL cholesterol > or =160 mg/dl). After 4 weeks on the American Heart Association Step I diet, patients were randomized among five groups: placebo; colesevelam 3.8 g/day; atorvastatin 10 mg/day; coadminstered colesevelam 3.8 g/day plus atorvastatin 10 mg/day; or atorvastatin 80 mg/day. Fasting lipids were measured at screening, baseline and 2 and 4 weeks of treatment. LDL cholesterol decreased by 12-53% in all active treatment groups (P<0.01). LDL cholesterol reductions with combination therapy (48%) were statistically superior to colesevelam (12%) or low-dose atorvastatin (38%) alone (P<0.01), but similar to those achieved with atorvastatin 80 mg/day (53%). Total cholesterol decreased 6-39% in all active treatment groups (P<0.05). High density lipoprotein cholesterol increased significantly for all groups including placebo (P<0.05). Triglycerides decreased in patients taking atorvastatin alone (P<0.05), but were unaffected by colesevelam alone or in combination. The frequency of side effects did not differ among groups. At recommended starting doses of each agent, coadministration of colesevelam and atorvastatin was well tolerated, efficacious and produced additive LDL cholesterol reductions comparable to those observed with the maximum atorvastatin dose.","Prospective controlled trials have shown regression of atherosclerotic lesions with this combination, but have also shown increased risks of myopathy."
"What treatments are effective for varicose veins
The purpose of this study was to investigate the possible long-term clinical advantages of stripping the long saphenous vein during routine primary varicose vein surgery. The study was designed as a 5-year, clinical and duplex scan follow-up examination of a group of patients who were randomized to stripping of the long saphenous vein during varicose vein surgery versus saphenofemoral ligation alone. The study was conducted in the vascular unit of a district general hospital. One hundred patients (133 legs) with uncomplicated primary long saphenous varicose veins originally were randomized. After invitation 5 years later, 78 patients (110 legs) underwent clinical review and duplex scan imaging. Sixty-five patients remained pleased with the results of their surgery (35 of 39 stripped vs 30 of 39 ligated; P = .13). Reoperation, either done or awaited, for recurrent long saphenous veins was necessary for three of 52 of the legs that underwent stripping versus 12 of 58 ligated legs. The relative risk was 0.28, with a 95% confidence interval of 0.13 to 0.59 (P = .02). Neovascularization at the saphenofemoral junction was responsible for 10 of 12 recurrent veins that underwent reoperation and also was the cause of recurrent saphenofemoral incompetence in 12 of 52 stripped veins versus 30 of 58 ligated legs. The relative risk was 0.45, with a 95% confidence interval of 0.26 to 0.78 (P = .002). Stripping reduced the risk of reoperation by two thirds after 5 years and should be routine for primary long saphenous varicose veins.","A randomized trial showed that saphenous vein stripping reduced by two thirds the need for reoperation due to recurrent saphenofemoral incompetence, compared with saphenofemoral junction ligation alone."
"How should patients with Barrett's esophagus be monitored
The reported risk of progression from low-grade dysplasia (LGD) to high-grade dysplasia (HGD) or carcinoma (CA) in Barrett's esophagus varies. However, the validity of a diagnosis of LGD may be questioned because of interobserver variability. A search of the Cleveland Clinic Foundation surgical pathology files between 1986 and 1997 yielded biopsy specimens from 43 patients with Barrett's esophagus diagnosed and coded as LGD. Patients with concurrent or prior diagnoses of HGD or carcinoma were excluded. The LGD cases were randomized and blindly reviewed by three gastrointestinal (GI) pathologists along with cases originally diagnosed as Barrett's esophagus without dysplasia (ND; n = 28), indefinite for dysplasia (IND; n = 14), or HGD (n = 15). Each pathologist classified every biopsy specimen as ND, IND, LGD, or HGD, and interobserver agreements were determined by kappa statistics (K). Follow-up data were available on 25 patients originally diagnosed with LGD. Progression was defined as a subsequent diagnosis of HGD or CA on esophageal biopsy or resection specimens. Agreement between two GI pathologists for a diagnosis of LGD was fair (K = 0.28) and poor (K = 0.21 and -0.04). Individual GI pathologists agreed with the original diagnosis of LGD in 70%, 56%, and 16% of cases. The 25 patients with follow-up included 21 men and four women (mean age, 67 yr) with a mean follow-up of 26 months (range: 2-84 months). Seven patients (28%) with follow-up developed HGD (five patients) or CA (two patients), 2-43 months (median: 11 months) after a diagnosis of LGD. The individual GI pathologists' diagnosis did not correlate with progression. However, when at least two GI pathologists agreed on LGD, there was a significant association with progression (seven of 17 patients, 41%, p = 0.04). When all three GI pathologists agreed on a diagnosis of LGD, four of five patients progressed (p = 0.012). In contrast, of the eight patients with follow-up and no agreement among GI pathologists for a diagnosis of LGD, none progressed. A high degree of interobserver variability is seen in the histological diagnosis of Barrett's esophagus-related LGD. Although the number of observations is low, a consensus diagnosis of LGD among GI pathologists suggests an increased risk of progression from LGD to HGD or carcinoma.","A case-series reported a series of 34 patients with LGD at initial pathologic examination. On subsequent surveillance endoscopy with repeat biopsy, 73% no longer demonstrated dysplasia. Such patients can be allowed to return to having surveillance every 3 years."
"Is there much risk in using fluoroquinolones in children
To evaluate the safety of fluoroquinolones (FQ) in comparison with other antibiotics in pediatric patients. A multicenter, observational, comparative cohort study was conducted between 1998 and 2000 in French pediatric departments. Patients who were receiving systemic FQ were included and matched to control patients who were receiving other antibiotics. Antibiotic-associated potential adverse events (PAEs) were recorded prospectively in both groups, and their rates were compared using univariate and multivariate analyses. Patients were recruited from 73 centers: 276 patients were exposed to FQ, and 249 composed the control group. Among patients who were exposed to FQ, 23% were younger than 2 years, 33% had cystic fibrosis, and PAEs occurred in 52 patients, leading to withdrawal for 11. The odds ratio for PAE in the FQ group was 3.7 (95% confidence interval: 1.9-7.5) and was not significantly modified after adjustment for potential confounders. Musculoskeletal PAEs also occurred more frequently in the FQ group (3.8%) than in controls (0.4%); they were recorded in 10 patients who were receiving standard FQ doses and were of moderate intensity and transient. The rates of PAEs and musculoskeletal PAEs were higher for the FQ group than the control group. This observation supports the American Academy of Pediatrics statement restricting off-label FQ use in pediatric patients to second-line treatment in a limited number of situations.","A large multicenter, prospective, non-blinded cohort study evaluated adverse effects in children receiving fluoroquinolones versus other antibiotics. Duration of fluoroquinolone use was 1 to 23 days. Arthralgias or myalgias, which were only evaluated clinically, occurred more often in children receiving fluoroquinolones-10 of 276 children (3.6%) vs 1 of 249 (0.3%), respectively (odds ratio [OR]=9.3; 95% CI, 1.2-195; P=.02). All events occurred within the first 2 weeks of fluoroquinolone treatment and resolved within 20 days. No tendonopathies were reported."
"When should travelers begin malaria prophylaxis
Three hundred and fifty-nine US Marines participated in a randomized double-blind clinical trial to assess tolerance of two prophylactic mefloquine regimens [250 mg salt weekly (n = 157) or 250 mg daily for 3 days followed by 250 mg weekly (n = 46)] compared with 300 mg weekly chloroquine (n = 156) over a 12-week period. The study participants were seen daily for four days, then weekly for 11 weeks. On each visit, the subject answered two computerized questionnaires (a review of body systems and an evaluation of mood states), participated in a physician interview, and was administered medications under supervision. A random sample of each group was assigned to either pharmacokinetic sampling or two wear a wrist watch size computerized sleep monitor (actigraph). The frequencies of intercurrent illness and other concomitant medications were tabulated. End study mefloquine plasma levels were obtained on all study participants. The results obtained showed no compromise in function due to dizziness or incoordination in the mefloquine groups. Overall, both weekly mefloquine and loading dose mefloquine were well tolerated. Sleep disturbance and increased dream activity were detected in the mefloquine groups. Depressive feelings were noted in two to three times more individuals in the mefloquine groups than in the chloroquine group early in the course of the study, and resolved in the majority of subjects as tolerance developed. Steady state mefloquine plasma levels were attained rapidly with the loading dose regimen in four days versus seven weeks with weekly mefloquine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",One way of reaching prophylactic levels earlier would be to give mefloquine 250 mg daily for 3 days followed by 250 mg weekly. A safety study of 157 healthy US Marine volunteers showed that preloading achieves prophylactic blood levels of mefloquine by the third day while weekly mefloquine is subprophylactic until the fifth week.
"How accurate is the clinical diagnosis of pneumonia
The reliability of chest physical examination and the degree of agreement among examiners in diagnosing pneumonia based on these findings are largely unknown. To determine the accuracy of various physical examination maneuvers in diagnosing pneumonia and to compare the interobserver reliability of the maneuvers among 3 examiners. Fifty-two male patients presenting to the emergency department of a university-affiliated Veterans Affairs medical center with symptoms of lower respiratory tract infection (cough and change in sputum) were prospectively examined. A comprehensive lung physical examination was performed sequentially by 3 physicians who were blind to clinical history, laboratory findings, and x-ray results. Examination findings by lung site and whether the examiner diagnosed pneumonia were recorded on a standard form. Chest x-ray films were read by a radiologist. Twenty-four patients had pneumonia confirmed by chest x-ray films. Twenty-eight patients did not have pneumonia. Abnormal lung sounds were common in both groups; the most frequently detected were rales in the upright seated position and bronchial breath sounds. Relatively high agreement among examiners (kappa approximately 0.5) occurred for rales in the lateral decubitus position and for wheezes. The 3 examiners' clinical diagnosis of pneumonia had a sensitivity of 47% to 69% and specificity of 58% to 75%. The degree of interobserver agreement was highly variable for different physical examination findings. The most valuable examination maneuvers in detecting pneumonia were unilateral rales and rales in the lateral decubitus position. The traditional chest physical examination is not sufficiently accurate on its own to confirm or exclude the diagnosis of pneumonia.","At a Veterans Administration hospital, a prospective cohort of 52 men with acute cough and change in sputum production underwent sequential blinded examination by 3 physicians. Rales and bronchial breath sounds were common, and chest x-ray confirmed pneumonia in 28 patients. Sensitivity of clinical diagnosis ranged from 47% to 69%, and specificity from 58% to 75%."
"What's the best way to manage athletes with amenorrhea
Postmenopausal osteoporosis is a major health care problem that affects 20 million women in the United States and accounts for > 1 million fractures per year. Hormone replacement therapy is effective for reducing bone loss in the postmenopausal women. However, intervention before menopause may delay or prevent the decline in bone mass that begins between ages 30 and 40 years. The effects of oral contraceptives on bone mass have been investigated, and a positive association between oral contraceptive use and bone mass that is directly related to the duration of oral contraceptive use was observed. The effects of oral contraceptives on bone mass may be related to the specific formation. The effect of estrogens is dose related, and the optimal dose appears to be 25 to 35 micrograms of ethinyl estradiol or its equivalent. Results from several studies show that norethindrone has a positive effect on bone mass. An oral contraceptive may offer optimal birth control for the older premenopausal woman who currently uses other forms of birth control. A review of the research literature on the effects of oral contraceptives (OCs) on bone mass suggests that premenopausal OC use may exert as beneficial an effect on preserving bone mass as hormone replacement therapy does on stabilizing bone mass loss in menopausal and postmenopausal women.  Of the 12 studies reported in the literature, 9 found some positive correlation between these two variables in postmenopausal and/or premenopausal and perimenopausal women.  The most significant increases in bone mineral density were recorded among women who had used OCs for more than 3 years.  One study found that bone mineral density increased by 1% for each year of OC use. The three studies that failed to confirm any differences between OC users and nonusers in bone mineral density could be criticized methodologically for their focus on subjects with less than 5 years of pill use.  Clinical studies have indicated that an OC containing 20-35 mcg/day of ethinyl estradiol in combination with the progestin norethindrone produces the optimal bone-sparing effect in premenopausal women while minimizing the risk of venous thrombosis.  Since osteoporosis affects close to 20 million women and results in over 1 million bone fractures each year, this is yet another noncontraceptive benefit of OC use.","Bone loss in amenorrheic athletes may have long-term consequences, even if amenorrhea is only temporary. Some theoretical and disease-based research suggests a possible role for oral contraceptives to prevent bone loss in pre- and postmenopausal women, but little research has investigated younger women with hypothalamic amenorrhea."
"Should you test or treat partners of patients with gonorrhea, chlamydia, or trichomoniasis
To examine the effectiveness of methods to improve partner notification by patient referral (index patient has responsibility for informing sex partners of their exposure to a sexually transmitted infection). Systematic review of randomised trials of any intervention to supplement simple patient referral. Seven electronic databases searched (January 1990 to December 2005) without language restriction, and reference lists of retrieved articles. Selection of trials, data extraction, and quality assessment were done by two independent reviewers. The primary outcome was a reduction of incidence or prevalence of sexually transmitted infections in index patients. If this was not reported data were extracted according to a hierarchy of secondary outcomes: number of partners treated; number of partners tested or testing positive; and number of partners notified, located, or elicited. Random effects meta-analysis was carried out when appropriate. 14 trials were included with 12 389 women and men diagnosed as having gonorrhoea, chlamydia, non-gonococcal urethritis, trichomoniasis, or a sexually transmitted infection syndrome. All studies had methodological weaknesses that could have biased their results. Three strategies were used. Six trials examined patient delivered partner therapy. Meta-analysis of five of these showed a reduced risk of persistent or recurrent infection in patients with chlamydia or gonorrhoea (summary risk ratio 0.73, 95% confidence interval 0.57 to 0.93). Supplementing patient referral with information for partners was as effective as patient delivered partner therapy. Neither strategy was effective in women with trichomoniasis. Two trials found that providing index patients with chlamydia with sampling kits for their partners increased the number of partners who got treated. Involving index patients in shared responsibility for the management of sexual partners improves outcomes. Health professionals should consider the following strategies for the management of individual patients: patient delivered partner therapy, home sampling for partners, and providing additional information for partners.","Treating partners of patients with sexually transmitted infection has been a core component of therapy since the 1940s. Traditionally, partners have been referred to a health care provider (by the index patient, the provider, or a public health officer) for evaluation before being treated. Current methods of partner referral reach only 40% to 60% of named sexual partners."
"What does the evidence tell us about treating very-high-risk patients to an low density lipoprotein <70 mg/dL
Ezetimibe, a cholesterol-absorption inhibitor, reduces levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol when added to statin treatment. However, the effect of ezetimibe on the progression of atherosclerosis remains unknown. We conducted a double-blind, randomized, 24-month trial comparing the effects of daily therapy with 80 mg of simvastatin either with placebo or with 10 mg of ezetimibe in 720 patients with familial hypercholesterolemia. Patients underwent B-mode ultrasonography to assess the intima-media thickness of the walls of the carotid and femoral arteries. The primary outcome measure was the change in the mean carotid-artery intima-media thickness, which was defined as the average of the means of the far-wall intima-media thickness of the right and left common carotid arteries, carotid bulbs, and internal carotid arteries. The primary outcome, the mean (+/-SE) change in the carotid-artery intima-media thickness, was 0.0058+/-0.0037 mm in the simvastatin-only group and 0.0111+/-0.0038 mm in the simvastatin-plus-ezetimibe (combined-therapy) group (P=0.29). Secondary outcomes (consisting of other variables regarding the intima-media thickness of the carotid and femoral arteries) did not differ significantly between the two groups. At the end of the study, the mean (+/-SD) LDL cholesterol level was 192.7+/-60.3 mg per deciliter (4.98+/-1.56 mmol per liter) in the simvastatin group and 141.3+/-52.6 mg per deciliter (3.65+/-1.36 mmol per liter) in the combined-therapy group (a between-group difference of 16.5%, P<0.01). The differences between the two groups in reductions in levels of triglycerides and C-reactive protein were 6.6% and 25.7%, respectively, with greater reductions in the combined-therapy group (P<0.01 for both comparisons). Side-effect and safety profiles were similar in the two groups. In patients with familial hypercholesterolemia, combined therapy with ezetimibe and simvastatin did not result in a significant difference in changes in intima-media thickness, as compared with simvastatin alone, despite decreases in levels of LDL cholesterol and C-reactive protein. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00552097 [ClinicalTrials.gov].).","The ENHANCE study, a double-blind, randomized trial conducted over a period of 24 months, compared the effects of 80 mg per day of simvastatin with either placebo or 10 mg per day of ezetimibe in 720 patients with familial hypercholesterolemia. The primary outcome measure was a change in intima-media thickness of the walls of the carotid and femoral arteries. The results of the study have raised the question of whether it is appropriate to target low density lipoprotein cholesterol primarily to reduce coronary heart disease risk, because ezetimibe did not affect carotid artery intima-media thickness, despite its effectiveness in reducing low density lipoprotein cholesterol."
"What is the most effective treatment for acute low back pain
Back pain is a common problem for which cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride is frequently prescribed. To perform a systematic review of cyclobenzaprine's effectiveness in the treatment of back pain. We searched MEDLINE, PsycLIT, CINAHL, EMBASE, AIDSLINE, HEALTHSTAR, CANCERLIT, the Cochrane Library, Micromedex, Federal Research in Progress, and the references of reviewed articles, and contacted Merck, Sharpe and Dohme for English-language, randomized, placebo-controlled trials of cyclobenzaprine in adults with back pain. Outcomes included global improvement and 5 specific domains of back pain (local pain, muscle spasm, range of motion, tenderness to palpation, and activities of daily living). Study quality was assessed using the methods of Jadad. Summary outcomes were obtained using a random-effects model. Patients treated with cyclobenzaprine were nearly 5 times (odds ratio, 4.7; 95% confidence interval, 2.7-8.1) as likely to report symptom improvement by day 14 as were those treated with placebo. Slightly fewer than 3 individuals (2.7; 95% confidence interval, 2.0-4.2) needed treatment for 1 to improve. The magnitude of this improvement was modest, with an effect size of 0.38 to 0.58 in all 5 outcomes (local pain, muscle spasm, tenderness to palpation, range of motion, and activities of daily living). Treatment efficacy for these 5 outcomes was greatest early, in the first few days of treatment, declining after the first week. Patients receiving cyclobenzaprine also experienced more adverse effects, the most common being drowsiness. Cyclobenzaprine is more effective than placebo in the management of back pain; the effect is modest and comes at the price of greater adverse effects. The effect is greatest in the first 4 days of treatment, suggesting that shorter courses may be better. Studies comparing the relative value of acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and cyclobenzaprine individually and in combination in the treatment of back pain are needed.","Cyclobenzaprine is more effective than placebo, according to a recent systematic review summary (odds ratio for improvement by day 10: 4.7 [2.7-8.1 95% CI]; number needed to treat [NNT] = 2.7 [2.0-4.2 95% CI])."
"What is the prognosis of postherpetic neuralgia
To estimate the frequency, duration, and clinical importance of postherpetic neuralgia after a single episode of herpes zoster. Prospective cohort study with long term follow up. Primary health care in Iceland. 421 patients with a single episode of herpes zoster. Age and sex distribution of patients with herpes zoster, point prevalence of postherpetic neuralgia, and severity of pain at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months and up to 7.6 years after the outbreak of zoster. Among patients younger than 60 years, the risk of postherpetic neuralgia three months after the start of the zoster rash was 1.8% (95% confidence interval 0.59% to 4.18%) and pain was mild in all cases. In patients 60 years and older, the risk of postherpetic neuralgia increased but the pain was usually mild or moderate. After three months severe pain was recorded in two patients older than 60 years (1.7%, 2.14% to 6.15%). After 12 months no patient reported severe pain and 14 patients (3.3%) had mild or moderate pain. Seven of these became pain free within two to seven years, and five reported mild pain and one moderate pain after 7.6 years of follow up. Sex was not a predictor of postherpetic neuralgia. Possible immunomodulating comorbidity (such as malignancy, systemic steroid use, diabetes) was present in 17 patients. The probability of longstanding pain of clinical importance after herpes zoster is low in an unselected population of primary care patients essentially untreated with antiviral drugs.","Among the 14 patients in a prospective study with pain persisting >12 months, 7 had complete resolution of pain, 5 had persisting pain that either improved or remained mild, 1 had ongoing moderate pain at 7 years, and 1 was lost to follow-up.No recurrence of pain was found among 183 randomly selected patients who had had resolution by 1 year."
"What is the appropriate diagnostic evaluation of fibroids
To evaluate the sonohysterography (SHG) for the diagnosis of intrauterine abnormalities and describe complications and failure rate. A prospective survey on 81 patients, (44 patients with menometrorrhagia, 30 with postmenopausal bleeding and 7 with infertility) was conducted. Histopathology and clinical survey, if sonohysterography was normal, were the gold standards. Pathology has been performed in 55 cases. There were four failures (cervical stenosis), one severe complication (endometritis), one pelvic pain. Sensitivity and specificity of sonography were 56 and 83%; for sonohysterography 88 and 98%; and for hysteroscopy 78 and 97%. Sonohysterography was accurate for the diagnosis of the submucous myoma component. Sonohysterography is available in uterine pathology, easy, safe and cheap, but sonographists and patients should be informed of the little risks of such examination technique.","In a prospective study of 81 symptomatic patients, using a gold standard of surgical pathology, sonohysterography demonstrated more discriminating positive and negative likelihood ratios (LR+, LR-) for detecting myomata than did transvaginal sonography or hysteroscopy."
"Which patients with suspected exposure to pertussis should receive prophylaxis
Whooping cough is a highly contagious disease. Infants are the population at highest risk of severe disease and death. Erythromycin for 14 days is recommended for treatment and contact prophylaxis but this regime is considered inconvenient and prolonged. The value of contact prophylaxis is uncertain. To study the benefits and risks of antibiotic treatment of and contact prophylaxis against whooping cough. The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2004); MEDLINE (January 1966 to February 2004); EMBASE (January 1974 to August 2003); conference abstracts and reference lists of articles were searched. Study investigators and pharmaceutical companies were approached for additional information (published or unpublished studies). There were no constraints based on language or publication status. All randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials of antibiotics for treatment of and contact prophylaxis against whooping cough were included in the systematic review. At least three reviewers independently extracted data and assessed the quality of each trial. Twelve trials with 1,720 participants met the inclusion criteria. Ten trials investigated treatment regimens and two investigated prophylaxis regimens. The quality of the trials was variable. Results showed that short-term antibiotics (azithromycin for three days, clarithromycin for seven days, or erythromycin estolate for seven days) were equally effective with long-term antibiotic treatment (erythromycin estolate or erythromycin for 14 days) in the microbiological eradication of Bordetella pertussis (B. pertussis) from the nasopharynx. The relative risk (RR) was 1.02 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.98 to 1.05). Side effects were fewer with short-term treatment (RR 0.66; 95% CI 0.52 to 0.83). There were no differences in clinical improvement or microbiological relapse between short and long-term treatment regimens. Contact prophylaxis (of contacts older than six months of age) with antibiotics did not significantly improve clinical symptoms or the number of cases that developed culture positive B. pertussis. Antibiotics are effective in eliminating B. pertussis from patients with the disease, rendering them non-infectious, but do not alter the subsequent clinical course of the illness. Effective regimens include: three days of azithromycin, seven days of clarithromycin, seven or 14 days of erythromycin estolate, and 14 days of erythromycin ethylsuccinate. Considering microbiological clearance and side effects, three days of azithromycin or seven days of clarithromycin are the best regimens. Seven days of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole also appeared to be effective for the eradication of B. pertussis from the nasopharynx and may serve as an alternative antibiotic treatment for patients who cannot tolerate a macrolide. There is insufficient evidence to determine the benefit of prophylactic treatment of pertussis contacts.","A Cochrane review of antibiotic use for pertussis prophylaxis, including studies published through 2002, found only 2 randomized, well-controlled trials (RCTs) that compared attack rates between contacts receiving placebo or antibiotic therapy. Neither trial included infants under age 6 months. The reviewers concluded that evidence was insufficient to determine a treatment benefit."
"What are the most practical primary care screens for post-traumatic stress disorder
To evaluate Breslau's 7-item screen for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) for use in primary care. One hundred and thirty-four patients were recruited from primary care clinics at a large medical center. Participants completed the self-administered 7-item PTSD screen. Later, psychologists blinded to the results of the screen-interviewed patients using the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS). Sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios (LR) were calculated using the CAPS as the criterion for PTSD. The screen appears to have test-retest reliability (r=.84), and LRs range from 0.04 to 13.4. Screening for PTSD in primary care is time efficient and has the potential to increase the detection of previously unrecognized PTSD.","Breslau's 7-item screening scale is another empirically tested, brief, simple means of identifying PTSD symptoms in primary care patients. The screen has been validated in a VA primary care clinic (N=134). With a cutoff score of 4, it has a sensitivity of 85% and specificity of 84%, yielding a positive predictive value of 71% and negative predictive value of 98%. The likelihood of a score <3 is 0.04 and a score >5 is 13.5. Scores of 3 to 5 have an indeterminate likelihood value (1.8). Patients with a positive screen should undergo further evaluation by a mental health provider."
"What is the best way to manage benign paroxysmal positional vertigo
The Canalith Repositioning Procedure (CRP) is designed to treat benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) through induced out-migration of free-moving pathological densities in the endolymph of a semicircular canal, using timed head maneuvers and applied vibration. This article describes the procedure and its rationale, and reports the results in 30 patients who exhibited the classic nystagmus of BPPV with Hallpike maneuvers. CRP obtained timely resolution of the nystagmus and positional vertigo in 100%. Of these, 10% continued to have atypical symptoms, suggesting concomitant pathology; 30% experienced one or more recurrences, but responded well to retreatment with CRP. These results also support an alternative theory that the densities that impart gravity-sensitivity to a semicircular canal in BPPV are free in the canal, rather than attached to the cupula. CRP offers significant advantages over invasive and other noninvasive treatment modalities in current use.","The most widely studied treatments for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo are the single-treatment repositioning techniques, such as the Epley maneuver."
"What is the best treatment for infants with colic
To determine the effectiveness of whey hydrolysate formula in the treatment of infantile colic in a primary care setting in the Netherlands. Randomized, double-blind, parallel trial with a 1-week qualification period and a 1-week intervention period. Participants. Forty-three healthy, thriving, formula-fed infants, <6 months old, crying >3 hours per day on at least 3 days per week. Infants were randomized to whey hydrolysate formula (n = 23) or standard formula (n = 20). Difference in duration of crying (minutes per day) between qualification week and intervention week. Analysis according to the intention to treat principle showed a difference in the decrease of crying duration of 63 minutes per day [95% confidence interval: 1-127 minutes per day] in favor of the whey hydrolysate formula. Five infants did not complete the trial. The scope of the study was not sufficient to expect significant differences in the subgroup analyses. An extensively hydrolyzed whey formula is effective in reducing the duration of crying in a primary care setting.","A small (n=68) study of an herbal tea showed reduced symptoms (RR=0.57 favoring the active tea), although the mean volume of tea consumption (32 mL/kg/d) is a nutritional concern in this age group. No adverse events were noted, but the small sample size limits the ability to detect any but the most common events."
"What's the best way to screen for anxiety and panic disorders
The paper describes the rationale, sensitivity and specificity of the Anxiety Screening Questionnaire (ASQ), a disorder-specific screening instrument for use in primary care. Two hundred and fifty subjects sampled from psychiatric, primary care settings and the community, participated in a test-retest reliability as well as a procedural validity study, using the M-CIDI with DSM-IV algorithms as a diagnostic yardstick. The ASQ was found to be easy to administer and acceptable and efficient in terms of sensitivity and specificity for generalised anxiety syndromes. The test-retest item reliability was good to excellent with kappa values of 0.6 or above. As compared with the validity standard, the DSM-IV/CIDI diagnoses caseness sensitivity was generally high (above 82%) for all diagnostic domains covered, whereas the specificity was only high for DSM-IV threshold and subthreshold generalised anxiety disorder. These preliminary findings demonstrate the usefulness of this anxiety screening questionnaire, constructed closely following the guidelines of specific diagnostic criteria.","The Anxiety Screening Questionnaire (ASQ-15) also has good likelihood ratios, but the sample population was small, selected, and over half of the subjects were from a psychiatric practice."
"Does tight control of blood glucose in pregnant women with diabetes improve neonatal outcomes
Offspring of women with pregestational diabetes mellitus are at increased risk for congenital malformations, largely attributable to poor periconceptional glycaemic control. We assessed the effect of preconception care in reducing congenital malformations, in a meta-analysis of published studies of preconception care in women with diabetes mellitus. Articles were retrieved from Medline (1970 to June 2000) and Embase (1980 to June 2000), and data abstracted by two independent reviewers. The rates and relative risks (RR) for major and minor congenital malformations were pooled from all eligible studies using a random effects model, as were early first-trimester glycosylated haemoglobin values. In 14 cohort studies, major congenital malformations were assessed among 1192 offspring of mothers who had received preconception care, and 1459 offspring of women who had not. The pooled rate of major anomalies was lower among preconception care recipients (2.1%) than non-recipients (6.5%) (RR 0.36, 95%CI 0.22-0.59). In nine studies, the risk for major and minor anomalies was also lower among women who received preconception care (RR 0.32, 95%CI 0.17-0.59), as were the early first-trimester mean glycosylated haemoglobin values (pooled mean difference: 2.3%, 95%CI 2.1-2.4). Women who received preconception care were, on average, 1.8 years older than non-recipients, and fewer smoked (19.6% vs. 30.2%). Only one study described the routine use of periconception folic acid. Out-patient preconception care probably reduces the risk of major congenital anomalies among the offspring of women with pregestational diabetes mellitus. Because many women with diabetes neither plan their pregnancy nor achieve adequate glycaemic control before conception, strategies are needed to improve access to these programs, and to maximize those interventions associated with improved pregnancy outcome, such as smoking cessation and folic acid use.","A meta-analysis comparing 16 studies of women with pregestational diabetes-13 of which included only women with type 1 diabetes-found that women receiving preconception care had lower early first trimester HbA1c levels than those who did not (7.9% vs 9.6%) and delivered fewer infants with major congenital anomalies (relative risk [RR]=0.36; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.22-0.59). One limitation of this study was that preconception care was not consistently defined among the included studies."
"What is the best therapy for constipation in infants
Many infants are switched between multiple formula preparations early in life because of perceived abnormalities in stooling pattern as well as gastrointestinal symptoms. To investigate the relationship between the type of formula consumed and the stooling characteristics and gastrointestinal symptoms of young infants. Healthy 1-month-old infants were fed one of four commercial formula preparations (Enfamil, Enfamil with Iron, ProSobee, and Nutramigen) for 12 to 14 days in a prospective double-blinded (parent/physician) fashion. Parents completed a daily diary of stool characteristics as well as severity of spitting, gas, and crying for the last 7 days of the study period. A breast-fed infant group was studied as well. Two hundred eighty five infants were enrolled and 238 completed the study. Infants receiving breast milk or Nutramigen had twice as many stools as other formula groups (P < .001). Infants receiving ProSobee had hard/firm stools more often than breast-fed or other formula-fed groups (P < .00001). Watery stools were more common in infants fed Nutramigen than other formula groups (P < .04). Green stools were more common in 12 mg/L iron preparations (Enfamil with iron, ProSobee, Nutramigen) than in those with 1 mg/L (Enfamil, breast milk) (P < .00001). Spitting, gassiness, and crying were of equal severity in all formula groups. The interpretation of stool frequency, color, and consistency must take into account the infant's formula type as significant variations in normal infants occur. Parental education on the range of infant stooling characteristics as well as the common occurrence of spitting, gas, and crying may alleviate concern for formula intolerance and underlying gastrointestinal disease.","Infants experience normal physiologic variation in stool frequency and consistency, moderated in part by diet."
"Does neonatal circumcision decrease morbidity
Circumcised men have a lower risk of HIV-1 infection than uncircumcised men. Laboratory findings suggest that the foreskin is enriched with HIV-1 target cells. However, some data suggest that circumcision could simply be a marker for low-risk behaviours. In a prospective study of 2298 HIV-uninfected men attending sexually transmitted infection clinics in India, we noted that circumcision was strongly protective against HIV-1 infection (adjusted relative risk 0.15; 95% CI 0.04-0.62; p=0.0089); however, we noted no protective effect against herpes simplex virus type 2, syphilis, or gonorrhoea. The specificity of this relation suggests a biological rather than behavioural explanation for the protective effect of male circumcision against HIV-1.","Circumcision may also be protective against genital dermatoses; a case-control study found an age-adjusted odds ratio of 3.2 (95% CI, 2.3-4.6) for penile skin diseases in uncircumcised men compared with circumcised men."
"What is the best way to treat patients with white-coat hypertension
The aim of this study was to compare the risk conferred by white-coat versus sustained mild hypertension for the development of cardiovascular disease. Patients (n=479) who underwent 24-hour intra-arterial ambulatory blood pressure monitoring on the basis of a persistently elevated clinic systolic blood pressure of 140 to 180 mm Hg were followed up for the development of subsequent cardiovascular events during a 9.1+/-4. 2-year period. White-coat hypertension, defined as a clinic systolic blood pressure of 140 to 180 mm Hg associated with a 24-hour ambulatory systolic blood pressure <140 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg, was present in 126 patients, and the remainder had sustained mild hypertension. A subgroup of patients without complications underwent follow-up echocardiography and carotid ultrasound. White-coat hypertensives were younger (44+/-12 versus 52+/-10 years, respectively; P<0.001) and had a significantly lower incidence of cardiovascular events (1.32 versus 2.56 events per 100 patient-years, respectively; P<0.001) than sustained hypertensives. Multivariate analysis revealed age (P=0.002), sex (P=0.007), race (P=0.001), smoking (P=0.005), and the presence of white-coat hypertension (hazard ratio, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.09 to 0.90; P=0.04) to be independent predictors of subsequent cardiovascular events. Subgroup analysis in patients without complications revealed a lower incidence of left ventricular hypertrophy and lesser degrees of carotid hypertrophy in the white-coat group. These findings indicate a relatively benign outcome in white-coat hypertension compared with sustained mild hypertension.","A prospective cohort study compared cardiovascular events among patients with white-coat hypertension vs those with sustained hypertension. The study evaluated 479 patients with persistently elevated clinic systolic blood pressures of 140 to 180 mm Hg. Using 24-hour intraarterial ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM), they found that 126 patients had ambulatory blood pressures below 140/90 mm Hg (white-coat hypertension) while 353 patients maintained pressures above 140/90 mm Hg (sustained hypertension). On average, white-coat hypertension patients were younger than sustained hypertension patients (44 vs 52 years) but were otherwise similar. Over the next 9 years, patients with white-coat hypertension had significantly fewer cardiovascular events than patients with sustained hypertension."
"Are antibiotics effective in preventing pneumonia for nursing home patients
Aspiration of oral secretions and their bacteria is increasingly being recognized as an important factor in pneumonia. We investigated whether oral care lowers the frequency of pneumonia in institutionalized older people. Survey. Eleven nursing homes in Japan. Four hundred seventeen patients randomly assigned to an oral care group or a no oral care group. Nurses or caregivers cleaned the patients' teeth by toothbrush after each meal. Swabbing with povidone iodine was additionally used in some cases. Dentists or dental hygienists provided professional care once a week. Pneumonia, febrile days, death from pneumonia, activities of daily living, and cognitive functions. During follow-up, pneumonia, febrile days, and death from pneumonia decreased significantly in patients with oral care. Oral care was beneficial in edentate and dentate patients. Activities of daily living and cognitive functions showed a tendency to improve with oral care. We suggest that oral care may be useful in preventing pneumonia in older patients in nursing homes.","In a single study, 366 patients in 11 Japanese nursing homes were divided into controls (self-care) and those treated with rigorous oral care (by staff). The intervention group had a relative risk of 0.6 (95% CI, 0.36-0.99; NNT=12.5) for pneumonia over a 2-year period. The number needed to treat for preventing a death by pneumonia was 11 (P<.01). This intriguing result merits follow up in larger groups in US nursing homes to see if this approach is feasible."
"Should people with a first-degree relative who died from subarachnoid hemorrhage be screened for aneurysms
To evaluate the frequency and identify risk factors of unruptured aneurysms in first-degree relatives of patients with sporadic subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). First-degree relatives (parents, siblings, and children) of patients with SAH have a three to seven times increased risk of SAH. Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) was performed in 626 first-degree relatives of a consecutive series of 193 index patients with ""sporadic"" SAH (participation rate, 78% of eligible relatives). The authors recorded demographic and medical data, and performed blood pressure measurements and blood tests (cholesterol, high-density lipid cholesterol, triglycerides, apoprotein A1, lipoprotein a, glucose). Aneurysms were found in 25 of 626 relatives (4.0%; 95% CI, 2.6 to 5.8%), and 6 relatives had multiple aneurysms. Index patients with multiple aneurysms and a younger age had a higher risk of aneurysms in relatives. Siblings of index patients had a four times higher risk than children. In screened relatives female sex, increasing age, polycystic kidney disease, hypertension, and elevated levels of cholesterol and glucose tended to be associated with a higher risk of aneurysms. No increase in risk was conferred by smoking or alcohol use, or by a previous family history of SAH or of atherosclerosis. First-degree relatives of index patients with sporadic subarachnoid hemorrhage have a 4.0% chance of intracranial aneurysms. Being a sibling of the index patient is the most important risk factor. Risk factors for general atherosclerosis (hypertension, smoking, hypercholesterolemia, high levels of blood triglycerides, lipoprotein a, and apoprotein A1) and use of alcohol do not increase the risk of intracranial aneurysms significantly in these relatives.","In a study using data from the same population, being a sibling of an islet cell antibodies sufferer increased risk of islet cell antibodies (relative risk=3.8, though with a wide 95% CI of 1.1-29.3). Neither hypertension nor hypercholesterolemia conferred increased risk of ICA, and the risk conferred by smoking and use of alcohol was statistically insignificant."
"Which postmenopausal women should be offered combined hormone replacement therapy
Accelerated bone loss after stopping hormone therapy (HRT) is postulated to explain the lack of hip-fracture protection conferred by former HRT use. The abbreviation HRT (traditionally standing for ""hormone replacement therapy"") is used herein because of its wide recognition in the field. However, the pharmacological doses of estrogens and progestins used are not truly ""replacement"" in nature. To determine whether women lose bone mineral density (BMD) after stopping HRT; to assess whether their rate of loss is significantly greater than that of women not undergoing HRT; and to determine whether long-term HRT is associated with continued gains in BMD. A total of 495 women who were adherent to assigned treatment in the 3-year Postmenopausal Estrogen/Progestin Interventions randomized controlled trial (PEPI-RCT) and who had an additional BMD measurement during the PEPI Safety Follow-up Study were observed for an average of 3 years during and 4 years after the PEPI-RCT. Women who stopped HRT after 1 year during the PEPI-RCT had annual rates of BMD change of -0.54% (hip) and -0.81% (spine) during the following 2 years. Those who underwent HRT for 3 years during the PEPI-RCT and then discontinued it had annual changes of -1.01% (hip) and -1.04% (spine). Rates of BMD loss among women who stopped HRT during or after the PEPI-RCT did not differ significantly from those of women who did not undergo HRT, who lost bone at a rate of approximately 1% yearly during the first year of the PEPI-RCT and about half that rate afterward. Women who continued HRT after the PEPI-RCT did not show additional BMD gains. Our results do not support the hypothesis that bone is lost at an unusually fast rate after discontinuation of HRT, nor do they suggest that longer-term HRT leads to additional BMD gain beyond that evident after 3 years.",Evidence indicates that women who take hormone replacement therapy for 3 years and then stop achieve as much protection from osteoporotic fractures as women who continue their hormone replacement therapy beyond 3 years.
"What are the indications for meningococcal vaccination
Elevated rates of meningococcal disease were noted among 18- to 22-year-olds in the mid-1990s. However, national data on rates of meningococcal disease in US college students were not collected until 1998. To determine rates of meningococcal disease in US college students and to identify risk factors for meningococcal disease in this population. Prospective surveillance study with nested case-control study of US college students with meningococcal infection from September 1, 1998, to August 31, 1999. Fifty state health departments and 231 college health centers participated. Incidence of and risk factors for meningococcal disease in US college students. Ninety-six cases of meningococcal disease were identified. The incidence rate for undergraduates was 0.7 per 100 000 persons vs 1.4 per 100 000 for the general population of 18- to 23-year-old nonstudents (P<.001). Freshmen living in dormitories had the highest incidence rate at 5.1 per 100 000. Of the 79 case-patients for whom information was available, 54 (68%) had illness due to vaccine-preventable meningococcal serogroups. On multivariable analysis of case-control study data, freshmen who lived in dormitories had an elevated risk of meningococcal disease (matched odds ratio, 3.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.6-8.5; P =.003) compared with other college students. Freshmen who live in dormitories have an independent, elevated risk of meningococcal disease compared with other college students. Use of the currently available quadrivalent polysaccharide vaccine among college students could substantially decrease their risk of meningococcal disease.","A 1998-1999 prospective surveillance study including 50 state health departments and 231 college health centers identified 96 cases of meningococcal disease in college students (incidence 0.7/100,000).

Sixty-eight percent had illness due to a vaccine-preventable serogroup."
"Do allergy shots help seasonal allergies more than antihistamines and nasal steroids
Asthma is a disease causing significant morbidity and mortality. In the recent past, there has been an explosion of pharmacotherapeutic options attempting to control the disease. Unfortunately, none of the current options offers the promise of prevention or a permanent cure. However, there appear to be exciting, new data emerging to support the hypothesis that the prevention or early treatment of allergic rhinitis, such as with the use of allergen immunotherapy, may help mitigate the severity of bronchial symptoms and even prevent the development of asthma. In this paper, we review recent research published proposing immunotherapy as a means of preventing the development of, or at least ameliorating, allergic asthma. There is evidence that the upper and lower airways may be considered a single unit, with the nasal and bronchial mucosa having features in common. Epidemiological, pathophysiological and clinical studies have shown that they can be affected by similar inflammatory triggers, with interconnected mechanisms amplifying the inflammatory cascade. Allergic rhinitis is interrelated to, and is a risk factor for, the development of asthma. An evidence-based review validates the successful use of allergen immunotherapy in treating allergic rhinitis and asthma. There is promising evidence advocating its use in the prevention of clinical asthma. This article explores current research pertaining to the use of immunomodulation, such as by using allergen immunotherapy, to ameliorate and prevent the development of allergic asthma.",A review of placebo-controlled trials indicates that the risk of developing asthma among patients with allergic rhinoconjunctivitis is significantly reduced when patients receive specific immunotherapy.
"Should you evaluate for coronary artery disease in seniors with premature ventricular contractions
To evaluate the prevalence and prognostic significance of asymptomatic complex or frequent ventricular premature beats detected during ambulatory electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring. Cohort study with a follow-up period of 4 to 6 years. Population-based. Surviving patients of the original Framingham Heart Study cohort and offspring of original cohort members (2727 men and 3306 women). One-hour ambulatory electrocardiography. The age-adjusted prevalence of complex or frequent arrhythmia (more than 30 ventricular premature complexes per hour or multiform premature complexes, ventricular couplets, ventricular tachycardia, or R-on-T ventricular premature complexes) was 12% (95% Cl, 11% to 13%) in the 2425 men without clinically evident coronary heart disease and 33% (Cl, 24% to 42%) in the 302 men with coronary heart disease. The corresponding values in women (3064 without disease and 242 with disease) were 12% (Cl, 11% to 13%) and 26% (Cl, 9% to 43%). After adjusting for age and traditional risk factors for coronary heart disease in a Cox proportional hazards model, men without coronary heart disease who had complex or frequent ventricular arrhythmias were at increased risk for both all-cause mortality (relative risk, 2.30; Cl, 1.65 to 3.20) and the occurrence of myocardial infarction or death from coronary heart disease (relative risk, 2.12; Cl, 1.33 to 3.38). In men with coronary heart disease and in women with and without coronary heart disease, complex or frequent arrhythmias were not associated with an increased risk for either outcome. In men who do not have clinically apparent coronary heart disease, the incidental detection of ventricular arrhythmias is associated with a twofold increase in the risk for all-cause mortality and myocardial infarction or death due to coronary heart disease. The preventive and therapeutic implications of these findings await further investigation.","The Framingham study looked at the prognostic implications of frequent PVCs (>30 per hour) in a cohort of symptomatic patients examined over a 6-year period. Men, but not women, had a significant increase in all-cause mortality (relative risk [RR]=2.36; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.65-3.2) and myocardial infarction or sudden death (RR=2.12; 95% CI, 1.33-3.38)."
